3079,20694,"Review: In ‘Independence Day: Resurgence,' the Fault Is Not in the Fireworks - The NY Times",NY Times,Manohla Dargis,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"If you've seen one movie apocalypse, you have seen them all, at least if it was directed by Roland Emmerich. For the last two decades, Mr. Emmerich has carved out his own perverse subgenre with   about   in which a happy few fight, joke and triumph despite alien invasion, a radioactive lizard, the Mayan calendar, melting polar ice and scene after scene of   mayhem. Even when he scales down, narrowing his cinematic gun sights on smaller stories (“White House Down”) Mr. Emmerich goes big and then bigger. So, here he is again, going once more unto the blockbuster breach with “Independence Day: Resurgence,” a sequel to “Independence Day,” his amusing 1996   behemoth. The earlier movie is best remembered for its shocker of a sales pitch: a shot of the White House being blown up by a shaft of alien light, an image that was as giddily funny as it was horrific to contemplate. Needless to say, thinking deeply if at all has never been something that Mr. Emmerich encourages. For the most part, his movies are engineered to generate autonomic responses, with frenetic visuals and booming noises that activate the    response, which in turn produces arousal. That's the hope, although “Resurgence” is likely to spur more   than popping. All you really need to know about the story is that it took multiple men to cook up this pottage, which hinges on another extraterrestrial invasion and humanity battling aliens as other familiar struggles erupt: technological determinism versus technophobia, secular universalism versus heroic individualism. Five writers actually put their names on the script, including Mr. Emmerich and his longtime collaborator Dean Devlin, and the results are predictably predictable if rarely entertainingly risible, with swaths of exposition and dialogue that sounds like ads (“one people, one world”). The lackluster, at times abysmal writing wouldn't much matter if “Resurgence” popped visually or featured a charismatic star who could lift a movie as effortlessly as Will Smith did in the first feature. Mr. Smith, unfortunately, declined to appear in the sequel, leaving his two   from “Independence Day,” Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum, to give it that old school try alongside veterans like Judd Hirsch and Brent Spiner, far and away the movie's most valuable player. All deliver professional, winking performances, but they're also stranded in an overly crowded cast that gives too much time to younger performers who, for the most part, slide right off the screen. Mr. Emmerich does manage to personalize this industrial production here and there, largely in funny little asides that sprinkle the action, like the cutaway to a character using his wipers to clean alien goo off a windshield. But too often, he seems to be trying to summon up energy and dredge up feeling in this movie by glancing back at the first “Independence Day,” as when Liam Hemsworth (as a flyboy) punches an alien, an echo of Mr. Smith's “welcome to Earth” triumphalism. Except that Mr. Hemsworth, a stolid, pleasant actor, isn't Mr. Smith, and this isn't “Independence Day. ” Somehow selling screen death by the millions with a quip and a teardrop just doesn't cut it. “Independence Day: Resurgence” is rated   (Parents strongly cautioned).  Bloodless apocalyptic death. Running time: 1 hour 59 minutes. "
3241,20875,The Agony of the Digital Tease - The NY Times,NY Times,Jessica Bennett,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"There was the breadcrumb dropped on Valentine's Day, by the   of my friend. The two women hadn't spoken in months, after a prolonged breakup, and the ex was now seeing somebody new. Yet there she was, on the day of   romance, “liking” my friend's Instagram photo   …     from three weeks ago. Which meant she had to have been scrolling through her feed. There was the friend, a digital strategist who, every few days, would receive a “sup” from a recruiter, except that the recruiter would never set up a time to meet. Once, my friend returned to his desk to find a “failed Google hangout” notification from this person, to which the recruiter later messaged to apologize for the “butt dial. ” My friend Victor Pineiro asked: “Was this a new recruiting tactic? Or just specific to this guy?” I've had my own share of breadcrumbers: the editor at the publication where I was vying for a job who repeatedly viewed my LinkedIn page (which I could see) but never messaged me the guy I went out with a couple of times who continued to text me every few weeks to “check in” months after we stopped seeing each other. Alicia Winokur, a recent graduate of Mount Holyoke College, said: “The worst type of breadcrumber is the one who resurfaces every six months, and like the Loch Ness monster, you almost can't believe this creature has come back into your life. But there he is, saying, ‘Hey, I was just thinking about you. '” “It's like a meerkat poking its head up,” she added. “But not nearly as cute. ” For anyone who's ever dated, or maintained any kind of relationship, in the digital age, you have probably known a breadcrumber. They communicate via sporadic noncommittal, but repeated messages  —   or breadcrumbs  —   that are just enough to keep you wondering but not enough to seal the deal (whatever that deal may be). Breadcrumbers check in consistently with a romantic prospect, but never set up a date. They pique your interest, of that prospective job, perhaps, by reminding you repeatedly that it exists, but never set up the interview. Breadcrumbers are one step shy of ghosters, who disappear without a trace, but are in more frequent contact than a person giving you the fade. On the hierarchy of digital communication, the breadcrumber is the lowest form. “It really is a cousin of the ‘friend zone,'” said Rachel Simmons, an author and leadership coach at Smith College. “It's about relegating a person to a particular dead end, but one that still keeps them hanging on in some way. ” One can presume that the term breadcrumbing came from the fairy tale of Hansel and Gretel, at least according to Urban Dictionary. In the tale, Hansel snags a slice of bread in order to leave a trail of breadcrumbs so he and his sister, Gretel, can find their way home. Hansel's breadcrumbs were a bust (a bird ate them) but the term was adopted by early computer programmers to describe those little navigation tabs that lead you back to home. The breadcrumbs we're talking about do the opposite. They lead you astray. Among the different types of breadcrumbers:   who try to entice you with a text message of a URL, but without providing any context or setup bitmojiers, or their cousins, snapchatters, who, rather than communicate with actual words, prefer to remain ambiguous with an exaggerated cartoon of themselves holding up a sign that says, “LOL. ” (LOL to what, though?) “God forbid you say ‘How are you? '” said Hilary Campbell, an illustrator in Brooklyn and the victim of a Bitmoji breadcrumber. There are creepers, who peep your social media pages but never make contact, even when they know that you know they have viewed your page there are zombies, who   from the dead, so to speak, after months of no correspondence and there are text bubblers, or those who type a message, stop, begin typing again and then stop, creating a specific kind of digital hell. “My brother breadcrumbs me constantly,” said Libby Leffler, a graduate student in Boston. “He'll send me random links on Reddit and then disappear. Sometimes in response I am like, ‘Did you die?' ‘Do I need to file a missing person's report? '” Like most of today's torturous microcommunications, we have technology to thank for breadcrumbs. Sure, they may have existed a decade ago (a nod on the street, a “what's up” in the hallway  —   these were technically breadcrumbs, right?) but they didn't have quite the same “desperate wondering about what someone means,” Ms. Simmons said. “These are connections, not conversations,” said Sherry Turkle, a professor at M. I. T. who studies how technology shapes modern relationships. “They can have the paradoxical effect of making the person who receives them feel let down rather than gratified, but then, confused: Is one asking for too much? Should one feel satisfied with a smiley face or a series of exclamation marks or a string of emojis? What constitutes being recognized?” In a dating context, this can be particularly complex. There's breadcrumbing when you've broken up with someone but you don't want to let them go there's breadcrumbing as a way of keeping a dating prospect on “hold” (what Ms. Turkle calls “activated but not active”). Or there's breadcrumbing as a kind of game: when a person is “not interested in you, but interested in themselves staying relevant to you,” as Ms. Campbell said. “I had a breadcrumber who I'm convinced deliberately tried to use as few characters as possible in his messages so as to not seem too interested,” said Jordana Narin, a rising college senior who wrote a Modern Love column about her generation's inability to commit. “So a sample text from him would be ‘wht are ur plans tmro' or ‘are u in city,' abbreviating some words and writing others out fully. It was like a game of how little effort could he put into it. ” Rest assured, though, there are ways to beat breadcrumbers at their own game. Sara Wilson, who works in social media marketing in Los Angeles, said she has developed a methodology for identifying a breadcrumber. It's centered upon a few key phrases she calls “lazy to the power of 100,” which include: “Yo” “Fun night?” “Ha” “Sup” “Nice” “hey stranger” “It's like the digital equivalent of a sneeze,” she said. Or, one may take the approach of Ms. Leffler. “Whenever people are breadcrumbish to me, I always reply to them with less words than they send me,” she said. “So if they were like, ‘sounds good,' I would respond with ‘thumbs up. '”"
3336,20986,Fox News's Convention Moment Overshadowed by Struggle Over Ailes's Fate - The NY Times,NY Times,Jim Rutenberg,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"CLEVELAND  —   This was supposed to be Fox News Channel's big week, a time to flex its muscles and flaunt its ratings dominance as the   media king of the Republican National Convention. Instead, the cable news network has been buffeted by a whirlwind of speculation and the specter of a public relations debacle as serious doubts were raised about whether its   and chairman, Roger Ailes, would remain at the helm of the network. It started with a report by NY magazine on Monday saying that Rupert Murdoch and his sons, Lachlan and James  —   the three men who sit atop Fox News's corporate parent, 21st Century Fox  —   had come to the conclusion that “Ailes needs to go,” after accusations of sexual harassment by a former anchor, Gretchen Carlson. (Ms. Carlson filed her lawsuit on July 6, after her contract was not renewed in June. Mr. Ailes has vehemently denied the accusations.) The article was followed 90 minutes later by a terse statement from the company: “This matter is not yet resolved and the review is not concluded. ” That chilly comment set off alarm bells at Fox News and in the television industry at large for what it did not say. The only previous public comment by 21st Century Fox took care to note that Mr. Ailes had its “full confidence” and that he had “served the company brilliantly over the last two decades. ” And, roughly two weeks after Ms. Carlson filed her lawsuit, interviews with people inside and outside the network  —   none of whom would speak for attribution  —   indicated a struggle within Fox News and 21st Century Fox over Mr. Ailes's fate, which now hinges on the findings of the law firm retained to investigate the accusations, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison. In initial interviews with Fox News staff members, investigators for Paul, Weiss turned up disconcerting findings about the omnipotence of Mr. Ailes. Some people felt pressured to publicly support him in a climate that could intimidate others into silence, according to a person briefed on the early stages of the investigation. In addition, a campaign inside Fox News to rally support for Mr. Ailes included an   article from the Fox Business Network anchor Neil Cavuto in Business Insider, in which he vouched for Mr. Ailes's character and said that the accusations being made against him were “sick. ” Mr. Cavuto holds senior vice president and managing editor titles at Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network, and his comments could be seen as chilling to anyone who was considering stepping forward with sensitive allegations. Mr. Cavuto, who wrote the article while recuperating from   surgery, said in an interview that the implication had not dawned on him. “I had no Machiavellian motive or sinister intention,” he said. “My only point was just to say this doesn't ring with the guy I know,” he said, adding that he had worked with Mr. Ailes closely for decades. “It was so far from what I had seen  —   as if I would ever condone that behavior. ” Several other Fox News Channel stars have come out in support of Mr. Ailes, including the anchors Greta Van Susteren, Harris Faulkner and Martha MacCallum. On Monday, Brit Hume, the longtime Fox anchor, speaking outside the Fox News production studios here, said, “It's inconceivable to me that any conclusions could have been reached at this stage. ” Mr. Hume has spoken publicly in support of Mr. Ailes since the suit was first filed. The idea of Fox News without Mr. Ailes is difficult to fathom. As the network   his personality is ingrained in the network's brash approach to the news, which he has described as an antidote to a biased mainstream news media. That his future is now in doubt represents a fundamental change in his unassailable status at the top of the    network. Ms. Carlson, 50, filed her lawsuit on July 6, saying she was ousted from her weekday afternoon show on Fox News after rebuffing sexual advances from Mr. Ailes, 76, and complaining about harassment. Ms. Carlson accused Mr. Ailes of ogling her in his office and calling her “sexy. ” Her description of sexual harassment and retaliation was followed by accounts from other women who say Mr. Ailes acted inappropriately in professional settings between the   and the late 1980s. But in voicing support for Mr. Ailes, several of his defenders questioned Ms. Carlson's motives and wondered why she waited until her contract was not renewed to file a sexual harassment lawsuit. Mr. Ailes was unequivocal in his response on the day Ms. Carlson's lawsuit was filed. “Gretchen Carlson's allegations are false,” he wrote in a statement. Fox News has been the No.   cable news station for 15 years, and represents about 20 percent of all profits for 21st Century Fox. Until now, it was widely assumed that Fox News's profitability would help ensure Mr. Ailes's position atop the network. Now the company has made it clear that what it calls the “matter” involving Mr. Ailes is bigger than corporate earnings."
3722,21413,"One Star Over, a Planet That Might Be Another Earth - The NY Times",NY Times,Kenneth Chang,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Another Earth could be circling the star right next door to us. Astronomers announced on Wednesday that they had detected a planet orbiting Proxima Centauri, the closest neighbor to our solar system. Intriguingly, the planet is in the star's “Goldilocks zone,” where it may be neither too hot nor too cold. That means liquid water could exist at the surface, raising the possibility for life. Although observations in recent years, particularly by NASA's Kepler   mission, have uncovered a bounty of   worlds throughout the galaxy, this one holds particular promise because it might someday, decades from now, be possible to reach. It's 4. 2   or 25 trillion miles, away from Earth, which is extremely close in cosmic terms. One astronomer likened it to a flashing neon sign. “I'm the nearest star, and I have a potentially habitable planet!” said R. Paul Butler, an astronomer at the Carnegie Institution for Science and a member of the team that made the discovery. Guillem   an astronomer at Queen Mary University of London and the leader of the team that made the discovery reported in the journal Nature, said, “We know there are terrestrial planets around many stars, and we kind of expected the nearby stars would contain terrestrial planets. This is not exciting because of this. The excitement is because it is the nearest one. ” Beyond the planet's size and distance from its parent star, much about it is still mysterious. Scientists are working off computer models that offer mere hints of what's possible: Conditions could be Earthlike, but they could also be hellish like Venus, or cold and dry like Mars. There is no picture of the planet, which has been designated Proxima b. Instead, Dr.   and his colleagues detected it indirectly, studying via telescope the light of the parent star. They zeroed in on clocklike wobbles in the starlight, as the colors shifted slightly to the reddish end of the spectrum, then slightly bluish. The oscillations, caused by the bobbing    motion of the star as it is pulled around by the gravity of the planet, are similar to how the pitch of a police siren rises or falls depending on whether the patrol car is traveling toward or away from the listener. From the size of the wobbles, the astronomers determined that Proxima b is at least 1. 3 times the mass of Earth, although it could be several times larger. A year on Proxima b  —   the time to complete one orbit around the star  —   lasts just 11. 2 days. Although the planet, lost in the glare of the star, cannot be viewed by current telescopes, astronomers hope to see it when the next generation is built a decade from now. And the planet's proximity to Earth gives hope that robotic probes could someday be zooming past the planet for a   look. A privately funded team of scientists and technology titans, led by the Russian entrepreneur Yuri Milner and the theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, have announced Breakthrough Starshot Initiative, a project to develop and launch a fleet of   spacecraft within two to three decades. Their proposed destination is the Alpha Centauri star system, which includes two larger, sunlike stars in addition to Proxima Centauri. “We will definitely aim at Proxima,” said Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer who is the chairman of an advisory committee for Breakthrough Starshot. “This is like finding prime real estate in our neighborhood. ” This newly discovered planet is much closer to its parent star, about five million miles apart, than Earth is to the sun, 93 million miles. Even Mercury, the innermost planet of our solar system, is 36 million miles from the sun. While Proxima b might be similar to Earth, its parent star, Proxima Centauri, is very different from the sun. It is tiny, belonging to a class of stars known as red dwarfs, with only about 12 percent of the mass of the sun and about   the luminosity  —   so dim that it cannot be seen from Earth with the naked eye. Thus Proxima b, despite its closeness to the star, receives less warmth than Earth, but enough that water could flow on the surface. Whether the planet has liquid water or an atmosphere is “pure speculation at this point,” Dr.   said in a news conference. If the planet formed close to the star, it could be dry and airless, but it might also have formed farther out and migrated inward to its current orbit. It is also possible that the planet formed dry and was later bombarded by comets or   asteroids. “There are viable models and stories that lead to a viable Earthlike planet today,” Dr.   said. Even if it is habitable, scientists studying the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe spiritedly debate whether planets around these red dwarfs are a promising place to look. Small stars are more erratic, especially during their youth, and eruptions off the star's surface could strip away the atmosphere from such planets. Levels of   and other   radiation bombarding the planet would be 100 times that on Earth, the scientists said. The close orbit suggests that the rotation of the planet would probably be gravitationally locked by the star's pull. Just as the same side of the moon always faces Earth, one side of Proxima b is probably eternally bright, always facing the star, while the other is ever dark. Additional visible light observations further convinced the scientists that they were not being fooled by variations in the star itself erroneously mimicking the presence of a planet. The discovery was more than a decade and a half in the making. Michael Endl, an astronomer at the University of Texas and one of the authors of the Nature paper, peered at Proxima Centauri for eight years beginning in 2000, looking for hints of a planet. “At that time, I didn't see anything highly, highly significant,” Dr. Endl said in an interview. “Then we published our data and moved on. ” Later, Dr.   analyzing data from a different instrument on a different telescope, found inconclusive hints of a planet. He reached out to Dr. Endl to reanalyze the earlier data, and he also spearheaded the Pale Red Dot project, which tried to observe Proxima Centauri daily for two months earlier this year. The new observations clearly revealed the 11.  period of the planet, and the signal matched what Dr.   had suspected earlier. It also matched a signal that was hidden in the noise of Dr. Endl's data, which was lower in precision and observed Proxima Centauri once a week or so, not every day. There are hints of perhaps another planet, perhaps more, but those hints are still ambiguous, the scientists said. The discovery could provide impetus for   telescopes. Ruslan Belikov of the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif. has proposed a small space telescope costing less than $175 million dedicated to the search for planets in Alpha Centauri. While it would not be powerful enough to spot Proxima b, its existence would give more confidence that terrestrial planets also orbit the two sunlike stars there. “It just raises the public awareness there's a new world just next door,” Dr. Belikov said. “It's a paradigm shift in people's minds. ”"
3748,21448,University of Chicago Strikes Back Against Campus Political Correctness - The NY Times,NY Times,"Richard Pérez-Peña, Mitch Smith and Stephanie Saul",2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"The anodyne welcome letter to incoming freshmen is a college staple, but this week the University of Chicago took a different approach: It sent new students a blunt statement opposing some hallmarks of campus political correctness, drawing thousands of impassioned responses, for and against, as it caromed around cyberspace. “Our commitment to academic freedom means that we do not support   trigger warnings, we do not cancel invited speakers because their topics might prove controversial, and we do not condone the creation of intellectual ‘safe spaces' where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own,” John Ellison, dean of students, wrote to members of the class of 2020, who will arrive next month. It was a    rebuke to the protests calling for limits on what kinds of speech should be condoned on campus, and who should be allowed to speak, that have rocked Yale, Wesleyan, Oberlin and many other colleges and universities in recent years. Some alumni, dismayed by the trend, have withheld donations from their alma maters. The Chicago letter echoed policies that were already in place there and at a number of other universities calling for “the freedom to espouse and explore a wide range of ideas. ” But its stark wording, coming from one of the nation's leading universities, and in a routine correspondence that usually contains nothing more contentious than a dining hall schedule, felt to people on all sides like a statement. Kevin Gannon, a history professor at Grand View University in Des Moines, dismissed the letter on his website as “a manifesto looking for an audience,” one that “relies on caricature and bogeymen rather than reason and nuance. ” The Heritage Foundation wrote on Facebook that the letter “will make you stand up and cheer. ” Other universities have made similar statements, but the message from Chicago is “clearer and more direct than I've seen,” said Greg Lukianoff, president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a leading critic of what it says are destructive speech restrictions at many campuses. “Sending a letter to freshmen is different than I've seen, at least in a long time, and certainly from a major university. ” Michael S. Roth, president of Wesleyan University, said the Chicago letter was, at least in part, a publicity stunt  —   “Gosh, is there any doubt?” he asked  —   and a way of “not coddling students, but coddling donors. ” Jeremy Manier, a University of Chicago spokesman, insisted there were no hidden motives behind the letter. And he said professors remained free, at their discretion, to use trigger warnings, the messages sometimes posted atop campus publications, assignments and other material, noting that they might be upsetting for people who have had traumatic experiences. Conservatives have been the loudest critics of campus political correctness, and hailed the Chicago statement as a victory. Mary Katharine Ham, a senior writer for The Federalist, a conservative website, wrote that it was “a sad commentary on higher education that this is considered a brave and bold move, but it is, and the University of Chicago should be applauded mightily for stating what used to be obvious. ” But while conservatives often frame campus free speech as a    issue, the dispute is often within the left. “Historically, the left has been much more protective of academic freedom than the right, particularly in the university context,” said Geoffrey R. Stone, a University of Chicago law professor who specializes in free speech issues. Conservatives “suddenly became the champions of free speech, which I find is a bit ironic, but the left is divided. ” Mr. Lukianoff said he and his group are often mistakenly called conservative, adding, “I'm a former A. C. L. U. person who worked in refugee camps. ” The dispute over free speech has ricocheted off campuses and around the country. In a commencement speech this year at Howard University, Obama said: “Don't try to shut folks out, don't try to shut them down, no matter how much you might disagree with them. There's been a trend around the country of trying to get colleges to disinvite speakers with a different point of view, or disrupt a politician's rally. Don't do that  —   no matter how ridiculous or offensive you might find the things that come out of their mouths. ” The University of Chicago has long been associated with the conservative school of economics that is named for it. It also takes pride in a history of free expression, like allowing the Communist Party candidate for president, William Z. Foster, to speak on the ornate   campus on the city's South Side in 1932, despite fierce criticism. Mr. Obama taught constitutional law at the university law school. The university said Friday that Dean Ellision and the university president, Robert R. Zimmer, were not available to discuss the letter or what prompted it, but Mr. Manier referred queries to Professor Stone, a former university provost. Last year, a faculty Committee on Freedom of Expression, appointed by Dr. Zimmer and headed by Professor Stone,  produced a report stating that “it is not the proper role of the university to attempt to shield individuals from ideas and opinions they find unwelcome, disagreeable, or even deeply offensive. ” “We didn't feel we were doing something, internal to the University of Chicago, that was in any way radical or different,” Professor Stone said Friday. It is clear that some colleges are retreating from the same free speech values, he said, “but my guess, if you asked most of these institutions 10 or 20 years ago, they would have said more or less what we said in our statement. ” Since Professor Stone's committee produced its report, several other universities, including Princeton, Purdue, Columbia and the University of Wisconsin system, have adopted similar policies or statements, some of them taken almost verbatim from the report. And this week's letter to University of Chicago freshmen draws from that and specifically cites the report as embodying the university's point of view. Many academics say the concerns reflected in the University of Chicago letter, while real, are overblown. “I asked faculty if any had ever been asked to give trigger warnings,” said Dr. Roth, of Wesleyan. “I think one person said they had. ” There often seems to be a generational divide on campus speech  —   young people demanding greater sensitivity, and their elders telling them to get thicker skins  —   but a survey by the Knight Foundation and Gallup gives a murkier picture. It found that 78 percent of college students said they preferred a campus “where students are exposed to all types of speech and viewpoints,” including offensive and biased speech, over a campus where such speech is prohibited. Students were actually more likely to give that response than adults generally. But when asked specifically about “slurs and other language on campus that is intentionally offensive to certain groups,” 69 percent of college students said that colleges should be allowed to impose restrictions on such expression. Eric Holmberg, the student body president at the University of Chicago, said the letter suggested that administrators “don't understand what a trigger warning is,” and seemed “based on this false narrative of coddled millennials. ” “It's an effort to frame any sort of activism on campus as    just young people who are upset,” Mr. Holmberg said, “when in reality I'd say the administration is far more fearful of challenge than any student I know. ” Sara Zubi, a Chicago junior majoring in public policy, said the dean's letter seemed contrary to some of the support programs the university has created or endorsed, like a “safe space program” for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students. “To say the university doesn't support that is really hypocritical and contradictory,” she said, “and it also just doesn't make sense. ”"
3754,21454,Quake Exposes Italy's Challenge to Retrofit Its Architecture - The NY Times,NY Times,Gaia Pianigiani and Elisabetta Povoledo,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"CASETTA, Italy  —   Romano Camassi, a seismologist, picked up a   speck as he surveyed the damage from this week's earthquake on the green mountain crest where the village of Casetta, now ruins, once perched. “This is just ground, soil,” he said, sadly. “In so many buildings in this area, that was the material used to keep together the irregular stones found in the surroundings which people used to build their homes. ” Experts like Mr. Camassi, who was part of the first team from Italy's Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology to arrive at the quake zone in central Italy, say the destruction was amplified by vulnerable buildings whose upgrades to   codes were deemed too costly for many Italians to carry out, too complicated to finance and too cumbersome to get approved. Italy is beloved for its rich architectural history. But that beauty comes at a steep price: both the lives lost when nature reminds its borrowers who is boss, and the money required in the attempt to even the scales. The country has spent an average of 3. 5 billion euros a year, or $3. 9 billion, for the past 50 years to fix earthquake damage, according to the Italian Association of Builders. And, in the aftermath of Wednesday's quake, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced yet another plan to rebuild and buttress Italy's ancient infrastructure. Many experts maintain that Italy has among the world's best   standards already  —   at least on paper. But the problems in executing them are legion: money, corruption, tangled bureaucracy, shoddy construction and a lack of enforcement of national regulations at the local level. This quake, like many in the past, already seems likely to expose corners that were cut, contributing to the 280 or more deaths in about 80 villages in the area along the Apennines, Italy's fragile spinal cord, where the 6.  quake struck. Prosecutors quickly announced an investigation into why a school in Amatrice, the town of about 2, 600 where the most deaths occurred, and the bell tower in nearby Accumoli collapsed. The bell tower, which had recently been refurbished, killed an entire family when it fell. The school, built in the 1930s and renovated in 2012, was supposedly built to new   standards. “You can have the best rules, but if the weak link is the human factor then it's all over,” said Gianpaolo Rosati, a professor of structural engineering at the Polytechnic University of Milan. “Unfortunately, we find ourselves always protesting about the same things. ” Perhaps the most central, and inescapable, problem is that Italy is old. About 60 percent of its buildings are estimated to be more than 100 years old. That means that most of the country's architectural heritage was built before any of the modern   standards were instituted. “You can't ask that an ancient structure adhere to norms designed for modern structures, but you can try to improve them, that's the path to take with the objective to save human lives,” said Donatella Guzzoni, an engineer and an expert in the preservation of historic buildings. “Italy has the best technologies to do this,” she added. “But it does come down to money. ” Casetta, a hamlet of about two dozen homes, sat on the hill north of Amatrice on the east side of the Tronto River that cuts this valley between two mountain chains. The area was among the most devastated by the quake for a combination of historical, economic and cultural reasons, Mr. Camassi said. “In many cases, they used rounded river stones, put next to one another by someone who ignored even the most ancient best construction practices,” he said. He pointed to a long cement beam hanging perilously from the debris of a   house. “When residents decided to reinforce the buildings, they often substituted the light wooden roofs with cement beams and bricks like that, which only worsened the impact of the quake because they burdened the otherwise frail structure,” he said. Mr. Camassi and other experts pointed out that certifying an existing building to   standards was difficult and often too expensive for most people. Just having a technical expert determine a building's vulnerability has a price, Mr. Rosati said, estimating it would cost around 10, 000 euros to evaluate a small house. “The cost of reinforcing a building to meet   standards can be around 300 euro per square meter, which means the owner of a largish apartment faces a cost of some 300, 000 euro,” he said, sometimes more than the apartment is worth. And it is not enough for just one homeowner to want to sleep a little easier. “The entire apartment building has to agree to do the same,” he added, and if the palazzos or apartment buildings are connected, the whole neighborhood must agree. Villages like Amatrice and Accumoli are loved for the charm of their narrow streets and spaces, where houses were built cheek to cheek over the centuries to use prime land, often atop narrow peaks. In those tightly packed places, the entire block must be reinforced or the buildings “interact” in an earthquake and can topple like dominoes, Mr. Rosati said. That is precisely the dynamic Mr. Camassi found in Casetta. “Neighbors built in different periods, different buildings with different materials, but adjacent,” he said. “So even those that would have resisted the quake were damaged or even taken down by the others. ” Farther up the mountain is Cossito, an idyllic village of little houses with red geraniums on the terraces. One narrow street divides a recently restored building from the town square, where almost all homes collapsed, killing at least three people. The village had only four families, Mr. Camassi said, and they all lost a member or a close friend. “We thought we did all we needed, but now we simply need to erase this house,” said Roberto Paganelli, a former police officer in the Carabinieri, who was retrieving items from his    mother's home. The building dates to 1864, he said, and was reinforced in the 1960s. The costs of evaluating and retrofitting old structures are prohibitive for many in this corner of Italy, an easy drive from Rome. Many of these homes were used only in the summer and were not primary residences worth a huge investment. In many cases, the residents are old, living on a pension and barely getting by. The state cannot oblige homeowners to upgrade their buildings unless there are obvious reasons to intervene. “We have    norms, but they only apply to new buildings or important restorations,” said Luca Ferrari, the president of Italy's Association of Seismic Engineers. “For the vast majority of buildings, we don't have an   classification, so no one knows whether they are dangerous or not during a quake. ” With a   group of experts, Mr. Ferrari drafted guidelines to classify buildings, with parameters similar to the energy efficiency of a building. This work finished in April 2015, but the government campaign  —   and its fiscal incentives  —   to reinforce existing buildings were still lacking, he said. “This area is at very high seismic danger, and we know that in these small towns of the Apennine Mountains, there are vulnerable buildings,” said Filippo Bernardini, a geologist who worked on Mr. Camassi's team. “Unless we build better, we offer no hope for the future. ” The alternative  —   razing ancient buildings to construct modern,    palazzos  —   is hardly an option. “In other countries there is greater renewal of the architectural patrimony. They don't think much about knocking something down to rebuild to different standards,” said Sergio Lagomarsino, an engineering professor at the University of Genoa. But, as Mr. Lagomarsino pointed out, Italy has a more conservative approach and is aware that preserving its heritage has value for the country. “In the face of an important building you can't demolish a historic center and rebuild it with fake stones,” he said. “It would ‘denaturalize' Italy. ”"
3755,21455,"A Cheaper Airbag, and Takata's Road to a Deadly Crisis - The NY Times",NY Times,Hiroko Tabuchi,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"In the late 1990s, General Motors got an unexpected and enticing offer. A   Japanese supplier, Takata, had designed a much cheaper automotive airbag. G. M. turned to its airbag supplier  —   the   company Autoliv  —   and asked it to match the cheaper design or risk losing the automaker's business, according to Linda Rink, who was a senior scientist at Autoliv assigned to the G. M. account at the time. But when Autoliv's scientists studied the Takata airbag, they found that it relied on a dangerously volatile compound in its inflater, a critical part that causes the airbag to expand. “We just said, ‘No, we can't do it. We're not going to use it,'” said Robert Taylor, Autoliv's head chemist until 2010. Today, that compound is at the heart of the largest automotive safety recall in history. At least 14 people have been killed and more than 100 have been injured by faulty inflaters made by Takata. More than 100 million of its airbags have been installed in cars in the USA by General Motors and 16 other automakers. Details of G. M.'s   process almost 20 years ago, which has not been reported previously, suggest that a quest for savings of just a few dollars per airbag compromised a critical safety device, resulting in passenger deaths. The findings also indicate that automakers played a far more active role in the prelude to the crisis: Rather than being the victims of Takata's missteps, automakers pressed their suppliers to put cost before all else. “General Motors told us they were going to buy Takata's inflaters unless we could make a cheaper one,” Ms. Rink said. Her team was told that the Takata inflaters were as much as 30 percent cheaper per module, she added, a potential savings of several dollars per airbag. “That set off a big panic on how to compete. ” Tom Wilkinson, a spokesman for General Motors, which was reorganized as a new company after declaring bankruptcy in 2009, said the Takata discussions “occurred two decades ago between old G. M. and a supplier,” and therefore it was “not appropriate for us to comment. ” “We knew that G. M. was getting   inflaters from others,” said Chris Hock, a former member of Mr. Taylor's team who left Autoliv in April. “That was a dangerous path. ” Even with the record recall, deadly accidents and research critical of ammonium nitrate, Takata continues to manufacture airbags with the compound  —   and automakers continue to buy them. The airbags appear in the 2016 models of seven automakers, and they are also being installed in cars as replacement airbags for those being recalled. Takata said in a statement that it had taken steps to protect the ammonium nitrate it uses against temperature changes, which along with moisture are the main factors contributing to its volatility. The manufacturer said it was also studying, along with safety regulators and some automakers, inflaters with a drying agent “to better understand and quantify their service life. ” The new airbag came not a moment too soon for Takata. The Japanese supplier had been making seatbelts in the USA since the   but its airbag business, which it began in earnest in the 1990s, was in trouble. A previous generation of airbags supplied to Nissan had the problem of deploying too forcefully. Those airbags were linked to at least 40 eye injuries in the 1990s. Takata began experimenting with alternative propellants. But in 1997 its inflater plant in Moses Lake, Wash. was rocked by a series of explosions that destroyed equipment and greatly curtailed production, according to insurance claims made by the company at the time. After the blast, Takata was forced to buy inflaters from competitors and airlift them to automakers across the country. The company's American business struggled “to maintain corporate viability,” Takata said in a lawsuit filed against its insurer. It was against that difficult backdrop that Takata embraced the cheaper new compound, ammonium nitrate, in its airbag inflaters, according to former employees. Mark Lillie, who had worked as an engineer at Takata, told The NY Times in 2014 that considerations over cost spurred the supplier to use the compound, despite the dangers associated with it. Mr. Lillie raised concerns over the risks in the late 1990s, but his warnings went unheeded. Around the same time, the team at Autoliv was asked to study the Takata design. Mr. Taylor, the head Autoliv chemist, said his team immediately recognized the risks posed by the ammonium nitrate. “We tore the Takata airbags apart, analyzed all the fuel, identified all the ingredients,” he said. The takeaway, he said, was that when the airbag was detonated, “the gas is generated so fast, it blows the inflater to bits. ” Mr. Hock, the former member of Mr. Taylor's team, said he recalled carrying out testing on a mock ammonium nitrate inflater that produced explosive results that left his team shaken. “When we lit it off, it totally destroyed the fixture,” he said. “It turned it into shrapnel. ” The former Autoliv scientists said that they considered their verdict against the ammonium nitrate irrefutable, so much so that they understood Autoliv had alerted other automakers to the danger. An Autoliv spokesman declined to comment on the company's dealings with its automotive customers, which at the time also included Chrysler, Ford, Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi and Toyota. Though Autoliv continued to supply those companies, several started using Takata's new airbags in the early to  . Fiat Chrysler declined to comment, while Honda, Mitsubishi and Toyota said that they had not located any pertinent information from that period. “There was no industry understanding in the late 1990s” that ammonium nitrate propellants, or explosives, were risky, Matt Sloustcher, a Honda spokesman, said in an emailed statement. Autoliv's concerns were backed by   research. Widely available studies going back decades warned of the tricky properties of ammonium nitrate, which can break down when exposed to moisture or temperature changes  —   vital factors, federal regulators said, with the defective Takata airbags. “Some of the worst industrial accidents at the worldwide level involve ammonium nitrate,” Luigi T. De Luca, an Italian academic and a leading expert in solid propellant rockets, said in an email. In a 2003 presentation, a propellant expert at TRW, which also made airbags with ammonium nitrate for several years in the early 2000s, outlined what he called “  issues” with using the compound, warning of “conditions that stimulate an explosive response. ” The expert, Harold R. Blomquist, said that explosive response could be triggered by moisture and by temperature swings. To make the inflaters safe, TRW had adopted several practices, according to Mr. Blomquist's presentation and a spokesman at TRW. It   its ammonium nitrate to protect it from moisture during the manufacturing process. It fitted its inflaters with a pressure release valve to prevent ammonium nitrate from overpressurizing. And it used advanced welding to keep the inflaters airtight. Those safeguards, however, were not   and the company phased out its use of ammonium nitrate in 2006. (Both Autoliv and TRW now use a propellant based on guanidine nitrate, a compound that is less sensitive to moisture and temperature swings.) The dangers associated with ammonium nitrate made it difficult at times for Takata to find a supplier. An internal memo prepared in March 2000 by the Mississippi Chemical Corporation, an agricultural fertilizer supplier, states that early talks to supply Takata with ammonium nitrate fell apart over liability issues. A handwritten note on the memo notes: “Send letter informing them about explosion hazard. ” Airbag design and performance specifications are set by a consortium of automakers, with little involvement by safety regulators. In congressional testimony, Takata has insisted that specifications set by the automakers did not anticipate the problems caused by exposure to heat and humidity over many years. But a review of the consortium's design and performance specifications by The Times shows the automotive industry had raised concerns about the risks of ammonium nitrate more than a decade ago. A 2004 update to its specifications singled out ammonium nitrate inflaters and required them to “undergo added stability evaluation. ” The specifications from the consortium, known as the USA Council on Automotive Research, show a clear understanding of the damaging effects of moisture and temperature on airbag explosives. Inflaters must be evaluated for their “resistance to temperature aging in an environment of high humidity,” the specifications said. The problem, it appears, is that no one enforced the specifications. The update in the specifications was issued four years before Honda, the automaker most affected by the defective airbags, started issuing recalls in 2008. It was not until 2013 that other automakers started recalling cars with the airbags. Today, 64 million of the defective airbags have been subject to the recall. The lack of enforcement of the specifications points to the   nature of automotive manufacturing. Joan Claybrook, a former administrator at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said that while the safety agency should have been more engaged, the system places a heavy onus on automakers to make sure that suppliers comply with basic safety standards. “Automakers play a big role,” she said. “They're expected to be involved with their suppliers in a very detailed way. ” A former Takata engineer who spoke to The Times and who was recently deposed by Honda in litigation with Takata revealed how easily the supplier avoided detection in getting the defective airbags to market. Workers at a   Takata plant in La Grange, Ga. manipulated tests meant to measure whether inflaters were airtight, said the former engineer, who still works in the automotive industry and spoke on the condition of anonymity. His testimony in the lawsuit has not yet been made public. The tests involved inserting a small amount of helium gas into the inflaters. The inflaters were then put in a vacuum. If too much helium was detected outside the inflater, that meant the inflater had a leak, was defective and should be scrapped. But workers at the La Grange factory would take the defective inflaters and test them repeatedly, to deplete the helium. With no helium left inside, the inflaters would pass the test, according to the engineer. The workers would then give the defective inflaters new bar code identifiers, so the repeated testing could not be tracked. The engineer said he questioned his Takata bosses in 2001 about manipulating the tests, but was told “not to come back to any more meetings. ” He left the company later that year. Honda said that it became aware of the manipulated tests only when the engineer was deposed by its lawyers. “Honda expects its suppliers to act with integrity at all times and is deeply troubled by this behavior by one of our suppliers,” the automaker said in a statement. Susan Bairley, a spokeswoman for the consortium led by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, said it did not keep records “of discussions leading to research results,” so it could not comment on concerns that might have resulted from the 2004 update to its airbag specifications. G. M. and Ford referred questions back to the consortium Fiat Chrysler declined to comment."
3772,21474,Gene Wilder Dies at 83 Star of ‘Willy Wonka' and ‘Young Frankenstein' - The NY Times,NY Times,Daniel Lewis,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Gene Wilder, who established himself as one of America's foremost comic actors with his delightfully neurotic performances in three films directed by Mel Brooks his eccentric star turn in the family classic “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” and his winning chemistry with Richard Pryor in the   smash “Stir Crazy,” died early Monday morning at his home in Stamford, Conn. He was 83. A nephew, the filmmaker Jordan   confirmed his death in a statement, saying the cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease. Mr. Wilder's rule for comedy was simple: Don't try to make it funny try to make it real. “I'm an actor, not a clown,” he said more than once. With his haunted blue eyes and an empathy born of his own history of psychic distress, he aspired to touch audiences much as Charlie Chaplin had. The Chaplin film “City Lights,” he said, had “made the biggest impression on me as an actor it was funny, then sad, then both at the same time. ” Mr. Wilder was an accomplished stage actor as well as a screenwriter, a novelist and the director of four movies in which he starred. (He directed, he once said, “in order to protect what I wrote, which I wrote in order to act. ”) But he was best known for playing roles on the big screen that might have been ripped from the pages of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. He made his movie debut in 1967 in Arthur Penn's celebrated crime drama, “Bonnie and Clyde,” in which he was memorably hysterical as an undertaker kidnapped by the notorious   bank robbers played by Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty. He was even more hysterical, and even more memorable, a year later in “The Producers,” the first film by Mr. Brooks, who later turned it into a Broadway hit. Mr. Wilder played the    accountant Leo Bloom, who discovers how to make more money on a bad Broadway show than on a good one: Find rich backers, stage a production that's guaranteed to fold fast, then flee the country with the leftover cash. Unhappily for Bloom and his fellow schemer, Max Bialystock, played by Zero Mostel, their outrageously tasteless musical, “Springtime for Hitler,” is a sensation. The part earned Mr. Wilder an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor. Within a few years, the anxious,   popeyed Mr. Wilder had become an unlikely movie star. He was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance as the wizardly title character in “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” (1971). The film was a   disappointment, partly because of parental concern that the moral of Roald Dahl's story  —   that greedy, gluttonous children should not go unpunished  —   was too dark in the telling. But it went on to gain a devoted following, and Willy Wonka remains one of the roles with which Mr. Wilder is most closely identified. His next role was more adult but equally strange: an otherwise normal doctor who falls in love with a sheep named Daisy in a segment of Woody Allen's “Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex but Were Afraid to Ask,” in 1972. Two years later, he reunited with Mr. Brooks for perhaps the two   entries in either man's filmography. In “Blazing Saddles,” a raunchy,    spoof of Hollywood westerns, Mr. Wilder had the relatively quiet role of the Waco Kid, a boozy   who helps an improbable black sheriff (Cleavon Little) save a town from railroad barons and venal politicians. The film's   humor may have lost some of its edge over the years, but Mr. Wilder's next Brooks film, “Young Frankenstein,” has never grown old. Mr. Wilder himself hatched the idea, envisioning a    film faithful to the look of the Boris Karloff “Frankenstein,” down to the laboratory equipment, but played for laughs rather than for horror. He would portray an American man of science, the grandson of the infamous Dr. Frankenstein, who tries to turn his back on his heritage (“that's   ”) but finds himself irresistibly drawn to Transylvania to duplicate his grandfather's creation of a monster in a spooky mountaintop laboratory. Mr. Brooks's original reaction to the idea, Mr. Wilder recalled, was noncommittal: “Cute. That's cute. ” But he eventually came aboard as director and   and the two garnered an Oscar nomination for their screenplay. Serendipity played a role in the casting. Mr. Wilder's agent asked him to help find work for two new clients, and thus Marty Feldman became Frankenstein's assistant, Igor (“that's  ”) and Peter Boyle the monster. Madeline Kahn, whose performance as the chanteuse Lili Von Shtupp had been a highlight of “Blazing Saddles,” played the doctor's socialite fiancée. Cloris Leachman was Frau Blücher, the sound of whose name caused horses to whinny in fear. The name Blücher, Mr. Wilder said in a 2008 interview with The San Jose Mercury News, came from a book of letters to and from Sigmund Freud: “I saw someone named Blücher had written to him, and I said, ‘Well, that's the name. '” And Mr. Wilder certainly knew a lot about Freud. His first of many visits to a psychotherapist is the opening scene in the memoir he published in 2005, “Kiss Me Like a Stranger: My Search for Love and Art. ” “What seems to be the trouble?” the therapist asks. “I want to give all my money away,” he says. “How much do you have?” “I owe three hundred dollars. ” Soon the jokes and evasions give way to the torments of sexual repression, guilt feelings and his “demon,” a compulsion, lasting several years, to pray out loud to God at the most embarrassing times and in the most embarrassing places. But never onstage or onscreen, where he felt free to be someone else. Gene Wilder was born Jerome Silberman in Milwaukee on June 11, 1933. His father, William, a manufacturer and salesman of novelty items, was an immigrant from Russia. His mother, the former Jeanne Baer, suffered from rheumatic heart disease and a temperament that sometimes led her to punish young Jerry angrily and then smother him with regretful kisses. He spent one semester at the   Military Institute in Hollywood. His mother saw it as a great opportunity in reality, it was a catch basin for boys from broken families, where he was regularly beaten up for being Jewish. Safely back home after that misadventure, he played minor roles in community theater productions and then followed his older sister, Corinne, into the theater program at the University of Iowa. After Iowa, he studied Shakespeare at the Bristol Old Vic Theater School in England, where he was the first freshman to win the school fencing championship. He next enrolled part time at the HB Studio in NY, while also serving a   Army hitch as an aide in the psychiatric unit of the Valley Forge Army Hospital in Pennsylvania  —   an assignment he requested because, he said, “I imagined the things I would see there might relate more to acting than any of the other choices. ” He added, “I wasn't wrong. ” After his discharge, he won a coveted spot at the Actors Studio, and it was then that he adopted the name Gene Wilder: Gene for Eugene Gant, the protagonist of Thomas Wolfe's “Look Homeward, Angel,” and Wilder for the playwright Thornton Wilder. In his first major role on Broadway, Mr. Wilder played the chaplain in a 1963 production of Bertolt Brecht's “Mother Courage and Her Children. ” The production ran for less than two months, and he came to believe that he had been miscast. The good news was that he met the boyfriend of the star, Anne Bancroft: Mel Brooks, who wore a pea coat the night he met Mr. Wilder backstage and told him, “You know, they used to call these urine jackets, but they didn't sell. ” So began the conversation that ultimately led to “The Producers. ” Mr. Wilder's association with Mr. Brooks led, in turn, to one with Richard Pryor, who was one of the writers of “Blazing Saddles” (and Mr. Brooks's original choice for the part ultimately played by Mr. Little). In 1976, Mr. Pryor was   behind Mr. Wilder and Jill Clayburgh in “Silver Streak,” a comic thriller about murder on a transcontinental train. The two men went on to star in the 1980 hit “Stir Crazy,” in which they played a hapless pair jailed for a crime they didn't commit, as well as “See No Evil, Hear No Evil” (1989) and “Another You” (1991). Mr. Wilder's first two marriages, to Mary Mercier and Mary Joan Schutz, ended in divorce. In 1982, he met the “Saturday Night Live” comedian Gilda Radner when they were both cast in the suspense comedy “Hanky Panky. ” One evening, he recalled in “Kiss Me Like a Stranger,” he and Ms. Radner innocently ended up at his hotel to review some script changes. The time came for her to go instead, she shoved him down on the bed, jumped on top of him and announced, “I have a plan for fun!” He sent her home anyway  —   she was married to another man  —   but before long, they began a relationship. By his account, Ms. Radner was needy, obsessed with getting married and, once they married in 1984, obsessed with having a child, a project that ended in miscarriage just months before she learned she had ovarian cancer in 1986. Of their first year of living together, he wrote: “We didn't get along well, and that's a fact. We just loved each other, and that's a fact. ” He left, only to find that he needed to go back. Ms. Radner died in 1989. “I had one great blessing: I was so dumb,” Mr. Wilder once said of her last years. “I believed even three weeks before she died she would make it. ” In memory of Ms. Radner, he helped to found an ovarian cancer detection center in her name, in Los Angeles, and Gilda's Club, a network of support centers for people with cancer. He also contributed to a book, “Gilda's Disease” (1998) with Dr. M. Steven Piver. Mr. Wilder himself developed  's lymphoma in 1999. With chemotherapy and a   transplant, he was in remission by 2005. In 1991 Mr. Wilder married Karen Boyer, a hearing specialist who had coached him in the filming of “See No Evil, Hear No Evil,” in which his character was deaf and Mr. Pryor's was blind. She survives him, as does a daughter from an earlier marriage. His sister died in January. Even before he became ill, Mr. Wilder had begun slowing down. He made his first and last attempt at a television series, the   and   comedy “Something Wilder,” in 1994. He returned to the theater in 1997 in a London production of Neil Simon's “Laughter on the 23rd Floor. ” In 1999 he was a writer for two TV movies in which he starred, “Murder in a Small Town” and “The Lady in Question,” playing a theater director turned amateur sleuth. In 2001 he appeared at the Westport Country Playhouse in Connecticut in a program of   farces. Shortly after appearing in an episode of “Will  Grace” in 2003  —   he won an Emmy for that role  —   he declared that he had retired from acting for good. “I don't like show business, I realized,” he said in 2008. “I like show, but I don't like the business. ” He was by then enjoying a new career as a novelist. His “My French Whore,” published in 2007, was the story of a naïve young American who impersonates a German spy in World War I. (“Just fluff, but sweet fluff,” the novelist Carolyn See wrote in her review in The Washington Post.) It was followed by two more novels, “The Woman Who Wouldn't” and “Something to Remember You By,” and a story collection, “What Is This Thing Called Love?” But it was, of course, as an actor that Mr. Wilder left his most lasting mark. In his memoir, he posed a question about his life's work, then answered it: “What do actors really want? To be great actors? Yes, but you can't buy talent, so it's best to leave the word ‘great' out of it. I think to be believed, onstage or onscreen, is the one hope that all actors share. ”"
3783,21485,Marco Rubio and John McCain Win Primaries in Florida and Arizona - The NY Times,NY Times,Lizette Alvarez,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"MIAMI  —   Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and John McCain of Arizona brushed off primary challenges on Tuesday from Republican contenders. Mr. Rubio will face a   race against Representative Patrick Murphy, a   Democrat, in a crucial contest for control of the Senate. Mr. McCain, seeking a sixth term, could also face a serious challenge, from Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, who has made it a point of her campaign to court Latinos and American Indians in an increasingly diverse and competitive state. The contest between Mr. Rubio and Mr. Murphy is likely to be among the most expensive Senate contests in the country. With his onetime rival Donald J. Trump at the top of the Republican presidential ticket, Mr. Rubio, 45, will seek to fend off Mr. Murphy, 33, who has faced recent accusations of résumé padding. They were not the only recognizable names to win races on Tuesday and move on to the Nov. 8 general election. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the embattled former Democratic National Committee chairwoman, won her South Florida battle against a   law professor who was endorsed by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The primary results appeared to point to a preference among voters in Florida, a pivotal swing state, to eschew more extreme candidates on the right and the left in favor of establishment lawmakers favored by national party leaders. Mr. McCain, 80, of Arizona faced a challenge from his right from Kelli Ward, a family doctor and a former state senator. In Florida, Mr. Rubio, who was asked by Republican leaders to enter the Senate race after saying he would not seek   defeated Carlos Beruff, a wealthy   gulf coast homebuilder. Mr. Beruff, who spent $8 million of his money on his bid, is an avid supporter of Mr. Trump. Mr. Rubio's Democratic opponent, Mr. Murphy, bested Representative Alan Grayson, a liberal provocateur who was favored by many progressives but faced ethics inquiries in the House and accusations that he had abused his former wife. “I commit to you that I will serve my full term,” Mr. Murphy told supporters Tuesday night, suggesting that Mr. Rubio would run for president again instead. Earlier Tuesday, in an interview on CNN, Mr. Rubio had been reluctant to commit to a full term, saying, “No one can make that commitment because you don't know what the future's going to hold in your life personally or politically. ” In a victory speech on Tuesday night, Mr. Rubio pointed out that Mr. Murphy, whose father is a millionaire, grew up wealthy, a sharp contrast to Mr. Rubio's humble upbringing. Mr. Rubio added that he had no intention to deliver a “rubber stamp,” no matter who was elected president in November. Florida voters were asked to cast ballots for an unusually high number of contested congressional primaries, the result of a   redistricting map that changed 24 of the state's 27 districts. One tough fight on Tuesday was the Democratic primary in Miami's 26th Congressional District, where former Representative Joe Garcia defeated Annette Taddeo, who was selected by former Gov Charlie Crist to be his running mate in his failed 2014 bid to recapture the governor's office. Mr. Garcia had faced criticism over fraudulent absentee ballots in 2012, but was never charged with wrongdoing. One of his former staff members pleaded guilty and served jail time. Mr. Garcia will face a   incumbent, Representative Carlos Curbelo, whose seat is threatened by the new redistricting map, which made the district less hospitable to Republicans. Mr. Curbelo won the seat from Mr. Garcia in 2014. Farther north in Florida, Representative Corrine Brown, a House stalwart who more than 20 years ago became one of the first   elected to Congress from Florida, lost her seat to Al Lawson, a former state senator. Ms. Brown and her chief of staff were indicted in July on federal charges of conspiracy and fraud. But Ms. Brown's   troubles predated her indictment. Her district was changed significantly, making it harder for a Democrat to win."
3787,21489,Fact-Checking Apple's Claims on EU Tax Ruling - The NY Times,NY Times,Katie Benner,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, issued a defiant letter to his European customers on Tuesday after the region's antitrust enforcer ordered Ireland to collect 13 billion euros, or about $14. 5 billion, in back taxes from the company. By turns outraged and scolding, Mr. Cook pushed back on the findings by Europe's competition commission, which said that Apple had made inappropriate   deals with the Irish government that let the technology company pay almost nothing on its European business in some years. Instead, Mr. Cook framed Apple's operations in Ireland as an investment in the people there, declared that Apple has a history as a good corporate tax citizen, and added that the European Commission's decision will hurt investment and business growth in Europe. We examined some of the points Mr. Cook made in the letter, consulting with five tax experts to   the chief executive's statements. While Mr. Cook was technically truthful, he omitted some context and shifted the spotlight from the thrust of the European Commission's case: whether Apple took advantage of loopholes in Irish tax laws. MR. COOK'S LETTER “As our business has grown over the years, we have become the largest taxpayer in Ireland, the largest taxpayer in the USA, and the largest taxpayer in the world. ” FACT CHECK While it's not a bad guess that Apple is the largest taxpayer on the planet because of the company's immense size, even Mr. Cook said in testimony before Congress in 2013 that this was just an estimate. USA corporate tax information is private, so there is no way for Apple to say for sure that it is the biggest taxpayer in the country, much less the world. The issue of how much money Apple pays in taxes is also a bit of a red herring. “This fight with the EU is not about what the company has paid in taxes overall, but about how much it should pay,” said Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the   Tax Policy Center. “Tax systems are not a     system. ” _________  MR. COOK'S LETTER “In Ireland and in every country where we operate, Apple follows the law and we pay all the taxes we owe. ” FACT CHECK Apple, along with many multinational companies, takes advantage of differences in national tax laws by moving money around the globe in ways that shrink their overall tax burdens. While a company like Apple may pay all of the taxes that it owes, it also tries to find legal ways to owe as little as possible. The EU wants to crack down on the ways that companies minimize their tax bills in Europe, especially in Ireland. In the 1980s, Ireland began modeling itself after Bermuda, a   corporate tax haven, said Khadija Sharife, a forensic financial researcher and an editor at the African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting. Ireland's corporate tax rate is 12. 5 percent, compared with 35 percent in the USA. While Ireland is phasing out some   rules, “companies will continue to come up with ways to pay less taxes in other countries until all countries across the world can agree on corporate tax rules,” said Lisa De Simone, assistant professor of accounting at Stanford University. __________ MR. COOK'S LETTER “The opinion issued on August 30th alleges that Ireland gave Apple a special deal on our taxes. This claim has no basis in fact or in law. We never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals. ” FACT CHECK The European Commission makes clear, and tax experts agree, that Ireland let Apple determine how much of the income that it generated in the country would be recognized and taxed there. The rest of Apple's income that was not recognized and taxed in Ireland could be put in other corporate structures that were effectively stateless. That meant the money in those structures was not taxable anywhere  —   not even in Ireland  —   and thus not subject to Ireland's 12. 5 percent tax rate. While other companies have also had the right to negotiate with Ireland, the commission considers these sorts of loopholes a  . “In the U. S. states can fall all over themselves to offer subsidies and loopholes, but that is exactly what is illegal in Europe,” said Edward D. Kleinbard, professor at the Gould School of Law at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. __________ MR. COOK'S LETTER “The Commission's move is unprecedented and it has serious,   implications. It is effectively proposing to replace Irish tax laws with a view of what the Commission thinks the law should have been. ” FACT CHECK Mr. Kleinbard said the commission is not replacing Ireland's tax law with a view of what the commission thinks should happen. It is simply asking Ireland to enforce the tax rate that it has and close loopholes that allow companies like Apple not to recognize large portions of the income they generate in Ireland and pay even less. __________ MR. COOK'S LETTER “This would strike a devastating blow to the sovereignty of EUmember states over their own tax matters, and to the principle of certainty of law in Europe. ” FACT CHECK Stanford's Ms. De Simone agrees with Apple that the EUruling hurts the sovereignty of its member countries. If Ireland wants to create rules that allow for stateless entities not to pay taxes anywhere, up until now that has been Ireland's decision to make. While the EUhas been trying to create harmony across the region when it comes to how to treat corporate taxes, for now taxes are “an issue for each individual member state in Europe,” said Dr. Liza Lovdahl Gormsen with the British Institute of International and Comparative Law. She said this case creates uncertainty for many multinational companies across Europe. __________ MR. COOK'S LETTER “In Apple's case, nearly all of our research and development takes place in California, so the vast majority of our profits are taxed in the USA. ” FACT CHECK It's true the majority of Apple's profits are taxed in the USA. But Ms. De Simone said Apple has also kept more than $200 billion in accumulated profits offshore. That money could someday be brought home and taxed, but Apple is in control of whether or not that actually happens. __________ MR. COOK'S LETTER “Beyond the obvious targeting of Apple, the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe. ” FACT CHECK There is support among tax experts for this statement. Mr. Rosenthal of the Tax Policy Center said so many countries are motivated to use low tax rates to generate business that Europe could lose multinational business if companies are discouraged by the commission's ruling on Irish tax treatment of Apple. But Mr. Rosenthal said the issue is ultimately broader than Europe. People would do well to also remember the total amount of government revenue being lost to   tax deals, he said. “If we allow companies like Apple to pick its tax haven  —   to place a few thousand employees in a place for a lower tax rate  —   we do add a few jobs,” he said. “But more widely, the taxes given up globally could be used for public service, worker training and infrastructure repair. ”"
3797,21499,Trump Gambles on Immigration but Sends Conflicting Signals - The NY Times,NY Times,Patrick Healy,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Donald J. Trump made an audacious attempt on Wednesday to remake his image on the divisive issue of immigration, shelving his plan to deport 11 million undocumented people and arguing that a Trump administration and Mexico would secure the border together. In a spirited bid for undecided American voters to see him anew, Mr. Trump swept into Mexico City to make overtures to a nation he has repeatedly denigrated, then flew to Phoenix to outline in his usual bullying tone his latest priorities on immigration. Yet the juxtaposition of Mr. Trump's dual performances was so jarring that his true vision and intentions on immigration were hard to discern. He displayed an almost unrecognizable demeanor during his afternoon in Mexico, appearing measured and diplomatic, while hours later he took the stage at his campaign rally and denounced illegal immigrants on the whole as a criminally minded and dangerous group that sows terror in communities and commits murders, rapes and other heinous violence. Mr. Trump's mixed messages on whom he would deport and when, and how the government would go about removing people from the country, were further muddled by the incendiary language in the Phoenix speech  —   a deliberate effort by campaign advisers to draw attention to his criticism of illegal immigrants rather than the specifics of his plan. In his speech, Mr. Trump fervently tried to depict himself as an ally of average workers, saying their economic interests were far more important than the needs of undocumented workers. But he left unclear what would happen to those millions of illegal immigrants, saying only that “the appropriate disposition of those individuals” will take place at some future date after the criminals are deported and his border wall is built. Deporting all illegal immigrants had been his signature political issue for much of the presidential race, but his caustic tone and harsh approach has turned off many Republicans and independents, particularly women. His language was still fiery in Phoenix, yet he also said that the fate of most illegal immigrants would be handled humanely, and not right away. “That discussion can only take place in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, no longer with us, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time,” Mr. Trump said, using the sort of vague phrasing that he once criticized. Never had Mr. Trump gambled quite like this. Aiming to appear statesmanlike, he traveled to politically hostile territory to meet with a president who might have surprised him with a rebuke, and he also risked support from some conservatives who do not want him cozying up to Mexico or softening his immigration plans. The trip to Mexico City was not without snags. Standing beside President Peña Nieto, Mr. Trump indicated that he had pulled a punch and chosen not to discuss his campaign promise to compel Mexico to pay for the wall. Yet Mr. Peña Nieto saw it somewhat differently, saying later on Twitter that at the start of their meeting, “I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall. ” Mr. Peña Nieto did not dispute Mr. Trump at their news conference, however, and Mexican officials said that the two men did not dwell on the wall and that their meeting was conciliatory. Still, campaign advisers to Clinton, the Democratic nominee, accused Mr. Trump of lying, and the Trump campaign issued a statement saying that the meeting was “not a negotiation” and that “it is unsurprising that they hold two different views on this issue. ” In Phoenix, Mr. Trump responded to Mr. Peña Nieto with the hectoring language that has long been part of his strategy to whip up his crowds. “Mexico will pay for the wall, believe me  —   100 percent  —   they don't know it yet, but they will pay for the wall,” Mr. Trump said. “They're great people, and great leaders, but they will pay for the wall. ” Mr. Trump had billed the Phoenix speech as a major address on immigration, and many Republican leaders and voters had hoped for more clarity about his positions. Mr. Trump outlined several steps that he would take to deport criminals and those who overstayed their visas and end   sanctuary cities, while saying that “the one route and only route” for others to obtain legal status would be “to return home and apply for  . ” “We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity  —   so important,” Mr. Trump said, noting that the status of most illegal immigrants was no longer a “core issue” for him. Mr. Trump also invited a group of Americans to the stage who, one by one, shared the names of relatives who they said were killed by illegal immigrants and insisted that only Mr. Trump could protect the country by securing its borders and moving swiftly to deport immigrants with criminal records. Yet for all the fiery language and stagecraft, it was far from clear if Mr. Trump's most ardent supporters would stick by him as he moves away from his original   policy on immigration, or if he would win over many undecided voters with his new approach. But Mr. Trump went to great lengths to urge voters to view the presidential race as an epochal moment. “We are in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis, and a terrorism crisis,” he said. “This election is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration, and reform our laws to make your life better. This is it. We won't get another opportunity  —   it will be too late. ” The whirlwind day started after Mr. Trump accepted an invitation from Mr. Peña Nieto to meet him at the presidential palace to discuss economic and border concerns. For the most part they managed to sidestep combustible issues and ignore raging hostility from average Mexicans. Mr. Trump has called them rapists and drug dealers, and he did not apologize for those remarks during a joint news conference when a reporter pressed him for any regrets. Instead, as an impassive Mr. Peña Nieto looked on, Mr. Trump sounded conciliatory themes about working together to improve border security. Gone, at least for this foreign trip, were the threats about American interests and superiority that have defined Mr. Trump's candidacy and electrified his supporters. “I think it was an excellent meeting,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Peña Nieto, who pointedly emphasized goals like “mutual respect” and “constructive” relations several times in his remarks, did Mr. Trump some favors with his respectful treatment: The Mexican president acknowledged that every country had a “right” to protect its own border, and suggested that Mr. Trump wanted to move on from his antagonistic remarks of the past. “The Mexican people felt aggrieved by those comments,” Mr. Peña Nieto said. “But I am certain that he has a genuine interest in building a relationship that would lead us to provide better conditions to our people. ” Mr. Trump's unexpected trip to Mexico was timed to steer attention from his significant shifts on immigration policy. He flew to Mexico just hours before he was scheduled to deliver a major speech on immigration after more than a week of mixed signals about his immigration views, which he said were “softening” and then “hardening” in the space of two days last week. On a more personal level, Mr. Trump also wanted to show undecided voters that he had the temperament and   of a statesman  —   qualities that many doubt he has  —   and also demonstrate that Americans did not need to worry every time he opened his mouth in a foreign country. He also hoped to show that he could acquit himself well on the world stage, something that is a clear strength of Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state, senator and first lady. Mrs. Clinton's campaign has described Mr. Trump's trip as a hollow gesture, but it was unclear whether Mrs. Clinton herself will deliver a more pointed critique of her opponent during his travels. Mr. Trump, who has little experience with foreign policy statecraft or news conferences with heads of state, made no obvious mistakes during his trip to Mexico, nor did he breach any protocol during his public appearance with Mr. Peña Nieto on a small stage at the presidential palace. As Mr. Peña Nieto made lengthy opening remarks in Spanish, Mr. Trump clasped his hands at times, and tapped them against his thighs as he nodded slightly at other points as he listened to a woman beside him translate the remarks into English. Mr. Peña Nieto came across as civil and stolid, defending the North American Free Trade Agreement  —   a frequent target of criticism by Mr. Trump  —   and noting that weak border security also allowed weapons and cash often to flow from the USA to Mexican gangs and drug cartels. But for the most part the president took a position of neutrality, neither chastising Mr. Trump nor indicating that he favored one American presidential candidate over another. Yet Mr. Trump, who is known for insisting that only he can fix America's problems, also suggested that he wanted Mexico to be a partner on border security. “I really believe that the president and I will solve those problems,” Mr. Trump said. “We will get them solved. Illegal immigration is a problem for Mexico as well as for us. Drugs are a tremendous problem from Mexico as well as us. I mean it's not a   street. ”"
3798,21500,Highlights of Trump's Immigration Speech and Mexico Trip - The NY Times,NY Times,"Michael Barbaro, Alex Burns, Maggie Haberman and Kirk Semple",2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Trump, in his   speech on immigration in Phoenix on Wednesday, pressed his   approach to illegal immigration, even as he backed off a previous pledge to forcibly remove 11 million immigrants here illegally. • Build the wall. • End the catch and release policy for undocumented immigrants and instead return them to their country of origin. • Have zero tolerance for undocumented immigrants who have committed a crime, and deport them. • Triple the number of deportation officers at the department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. • Repeal Obama's executive orders that temporarily protected undocumented immigrants from deportation and authorized them to receive work permit • Stop issuing visas to any country where “adequate screening cannot occur” that might endanger national security. • Ensure foreign countries take back deported immigrants from the USA (Mr. Trump said 23 countries refuse to do so). • Complete a biometric entry and exit visa tracking system under development. “It will be on land, it will be on sea, it will be in the air,” he said. • Mr. Trump made the case that Washington elites and the media have put the focus, wrongly, on the plight of an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, rather than the Americans impacted by their presence. “Anyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington. Only the out of touch media elites think the biggest problems facing American society today is that there are 11 illegal immigrants who don't have legal status. ” • Trump ticked through the names of three Americans who were killed by undocumented immigrants. These are staples of his speeches and familiar to his audiences at this stage of the campaign. He has held them up as examples of an immigration system run amok with tragic consequences. • Comparing himself to Clinton, who he maligned throughout the speech, Mr. Trump asked: “What do you have to lose? Choose me. ” It was an echo of a much mocked question he asked black voters recently. • “Maybe they'll be able to deport her. ” Mr. Trump wondered provocatively, whether it's possible to send Mrs. Clinton out of the country. • A memorable passage from this speech: “Our message to the world will be this: You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the USA by illegally entering our country. Can't do it. This declaration alone will stop the crisis of illegal crossing. You can't just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized. Those days are over. ” • Mr. Trump invited onto the stage the mothers and fathers of Americans whose children were killed by undocumented immigrants. He asked each to describe their children and how they died. He then kissed many of them on the cheek. It was the most emotional moment of the speech. “If you don't vote Trump, we won't have a country,” one of the mother told the audience. Mr. Trump, first reading slowly from a statement and then speaking more freely in response to a question, said he now considered Mr. Peña Nieto a friend and heaped praise on Americans of Mexican descent.   Mr. Trump said, were “beyond reproach” and “spectacular,   people. ” But Mr. Trump said he also told Mr. Peña Nieto directly that he felt Mexico had benefited disproportionately from its trade agreements with the USA, and that he had described illegal immigration as a problem for both countries. Mr. Trump said the two did not discuss the issue of forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall  —   one of the signature promises of his campaign. Mr. Peña Nieto did not challenge the idea during the news conference but later posted on Twitter that, during his meeting with Mr. Trump, he had made it clear that Mexico wouldn't pay for the wall. Mr. Peña Nieto pushed back in the gentlest of terms on several of Mr. Trump's claims on Nafta, citing U. S. Chamber of Commerce statistics to argue that free trade had been beneficial for both countries and stressing the economic importance of easy movement across the border. Without mentioning specific remarks by Mr. Trump, Mexico's president said that hurtful comments had been made. “Mexican nationals in the USA are honest people, working people,” he said, adding, “Mexicans deserve everybody's respect. ” But Mr. Peña Nieto stopped well short of scolding Mr. Trump on the international stage. On the contrary, he expressed optimism that they could work together if Mr. Trump was elected president, “even though we do not agree on everything. ” The showing was something of a surprise, considering the sense of betrayal among many Mexicans, who feel that their president sold them out to the worst possible person. By the start time of 11 a. m. there were dozens of journalist but only a few protesters. A   later, the number of protesters  —   at least those being vocal and carrying   signs  —   seemed stuck at four, including a guy wearing a Mexican wrestling mask, while the number of journalists topped 50. By 12:30 p. m. there were no more than 10 demonstrators, while the journalist pack continued to balloon. Still, the protesters did their best to represent the anger and disappointment that many Mexicans have expressed toward Mr. Trump as well as toward Mr. Peña Nieto, who is struggling with low approval ratings and a string of scandals. He has spoken out sharply against Mr. Trump in the past, saying in a television interview last month that there was “no way” Mexico would pay for a border wall, and earlier comparing Mr. Trump's campaign to the rise of Hitler. “The president didn't represent the Mexican people, he didn't consult with us,” said the demonstrator in the wrestling mask, who called himself “Maldito Perro”  —   Damned Dog  —   though later said his real name was Diego Garcia. He admitted to being disappointed by the anemic turnout. Social media activity, he lamented, seemed to be replacing the   tradition of the street protest."
3799,21502,All Impeachments Are Political. But Was Brazil's Something More Sinister? - The NY Times,NY Times,Amanda Taub,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   Was the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff as the president of Brazil on Wednesday a coup? Technically, the answer is no. Although there is no single definition of what constitutes a coup, it is at its core an illegal seizure of power. The Brazilian Senate's    vote to remove Ms. Rousseff was the culmination of a legal process set forth in the Brazilian Constitution, and it simply does not meet that standard. But Ms. Rousseff and her supporters have argued for months that the effort to oust her was in fact a coup engineered by a small group of elites. They are not bothered by strict legal definitions. Rather, “coup” has become shorthand for accusing Ms. Rousseff's political opponents of exploiting the law to subvert democracy. There is truth to that. But it is rooted in problems that afflict Brazil's entire political system, not just its right or its left. Any opposition party anywhere stands to gain from the downfall of the governing party's leader. In Brazil, that was heightened by the fact that members of the opposition had been caught up in a major corruption scandal. Romero Jucá, an influential opposition legislator who had been implicated in the scandal, was recorded in March saying of the investigation, “We have to change the government to be able to stop this bleeding. ” Ms. Rousseff was impeached on what analysts near universally described as minor charges: concealing a budget deficit by borrowing from a   bank  —   illegal, but not a criminal offense. Amy Erica Smith, an assistant political science professor at Iowa State University who studies Brazil, said these charges “don't rise to the level of the kind of accusations that would merit impeachment,” adding: “It's not a legitimate use of the impeachment proceedings. ” This is why Ms. Rousseff and her allies argued that the politicians pushing impeachment were not trying to protect the integrity of Brazilian democracy, but, rather, to manipulate it to serve their own ends. Calling the impeachment a coup became a way to question the motives of opposition leaders and to argue that impeaching Ms. Rousseff would be contrary to democracy. Normally, following the law  —   which the impeachers were indeed doing  —   by design serves democracy. But, in Brazil, there is currently just enough corruption and just enough rule of law for political elites to play the two against each other. Corruption, Professor Smith explained, is so endemic in Brazilian politics that it most likely implicates the entire governing class. The country also has a powerful judiciary that is actively working to investigate and prosecute corruption  —   an unstable combination. This gives political elites both a means and an incentive to expose their rivals, knowing it will probably ruin them. After all, if everyone is corrupt, everyone is vulnerable. But while that serves individual politicians, it weakens the wider political system by introducing instability. And because Brazil's economy is doing so poorly, the public is, understandably, angry at the government and eager to see corruption punished. So while Ms. Rousseff's supporters might see this impeachment as a cynical ploy, her opponents see a symbolic blow against a corrupt system  —   even if that corruption extends across party lines. There is also an important class dimension playing out. Ms. Rousseff led the   Workers Party, which positions itself as a champion of the poor. The opposition Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement, which pushed for Ms. Rousseff's ouster and took power after she was suspended from office in May, is seen as a champion of business interests. In the eyes of Workers Party devotees, the impeachment proceedings had an element of class warfare, with the elite seizing power to protect their interests  —   which, to the other side, looks and feels like a coup even if it does not meet the formal definition. That perception was captured by a photograph, which went viral on social media, of a   couple in a wealthy neighborhood walking to a protest against President Rousseff in March while their maid pushed their children in a stroller alongside them. “When people talk about ‘coup mongers,' ” said Professor Smith, “they're often implicitly thinking about, you know, a rich white woman who is upset that her maid now is entitled to labor protections that limit what this rich white woman can ask her maid to do. ” But this view, promoted by Ms. Rousseff's staunchest supports, is something of a caricature. An April poll by the firm Datafolha found that 61 percent of Brazilians supported holding impeachment proceedings against Ms. Rousseff, and that her approval rating was a scant 13 percent. . So it is not the case, as some have argued, that Ms. Rousseff's impeachment was a coup in the sense that a handful of elites subverted the popular will. Nor have they, in these proceedings, gone outside the law. Rather, Ms. Rousseff's political opponents have done something subtler: They exploited the popular will and the letter of the law to serve their own interests, rather than the interests of democracy. Of course, in all countries, politicians act out of  . And impeachment proceedings are always political  —   something that any American who lived through President Bill Clinton's impeachment hearings can tell you. But the particular nature of Brazil's system at this moment makes its politics particularly unstable, and gives individual politicians greater power to leverage democracy toward ends that are not so democratic."
3801,21504,Court Throws Out $655.5 Million Terrorism Verdict Against Palestinian Groups - The NY Times,NY Times,Benjamin Weiser,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"A federal appeals court in NY has thrown out a $655. 5 million verdict rendered last year that had held the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization liable for their roles in supporting terrorist attacks in Israel that claimed American lives. In reversing the verdict on Wednesday in the case, which drew the attention of the Obama administration, the appeals court did not minimize the impact of the six terrorist attacks, which occurred from 2002 to 2004, but it held that the Federal District Court in Manhattan had lacked the jurisdiction to hear the case. “The terror   attacks and suicide bombings that triggered this suit and victimized these plaintiffs were unquestionably horrific,” said a   panel of the USA Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan. “But the federal courts cannot exercise jurisdiction in a civil case beyond the limits prescribed by the due process clause of the Constitution,” the court added, “no matter how horrendous the underlying attacks or morally compelling the plaintiffs' claims. ” The plaintiffs included 10 families, comprising about three dozen people, eight of whom were physically injured in the attacks, as well as the estates of several victims who were killed. The suit was brought under the   Act, which provided for the tripling of the $218. 5 million in damages awarded by a Manhattan jury. The law, which allows USA citizens who are the victims of international terrorism to sue in the federal courts, was passed some years after the 1985 murder of Leon Klinghoffer in the Palestinian hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro. Kent A. Yalowitz, a lawyer for the families in the case, said in a statement that the law had been passed by Congress “to protect Americans wherever in the world they traveled. ” “The very terrorists who prompted the law have now hidden behind the U. S. Constitution to avoid responsibility for their crimes,” Mr. Yalowitz said. “This cruel decision must be corrected so that these families may receive justice. ” Mr. Yalowitz said the plaintiffs were weighing their options, which could include seeking review by the full appeals court, or asking the USA Supreme Court to hear the case. The attacks in Israel occurred on the street, at a crowded bus stop and inside a bus, and in a cafeteria on the Hebrew University campus. Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the P. L. O. 's executive committee who testified for the defense in the trial, expressed satisfaction with the appeals court's decision, saying, “I hope this is the end of it. ” Speaking by telephone from Ramallah in the West Bank, Ms. Ashrawi said, “Finally the American justice system proved its impartiality. ” She added that the decision “restores my faith in the judicial system. ” The jury in the   trial, which ended in February 2015, heard emotional testimony from victims and witnesses in the attacks. But in finding that the federal court lacked jurisdiction, the appellate panel ruled that the connections between the Palestinian defendants and the USA were not sufficient to give the trial court the power to hear the plaintiffs' claims. Judge John G. Koeltl, writing for the panel, said the attacks in Israel had not been “expressly aimed at the USA,” and evidence presented by the plaintiffs had established the attacks' “random and fortuitous nature. ” “Evidence at trial showed that the shooters fired ‘indiscriminately,'” the judge wrote, “and chose sites for their suicide bomb attacks that were ‘full of people,' because they sought to kill ‘as many people as possible. '” The decision was joined by Judges Pierre N. Leval and Christopher F. Droney. The trial judge, George B. Daniels, had required the Palestinian Authority to post a bond of $10 million and an additional $1 million monthly to appeal the case. The bond is typically 111 percent of the judgment, but the authority said it could not afford that. Lawyers for the victims had objected to the lower amount, but the authority won support from an unexpected source: the Obama administration. Officials at the Justice and State Departments had asked Judge Daniels to consider the ramifications of requiring too high a bond, suggesting that doing so could cause economic and political harm to the Palestinian Authority and the broader peace process. “A P. A. insolvency and collapse would harm current and future U. S.  efforts to achieve a   solution to the   conflict,” Antony J. Blinken, the deputy secretary of state, said in a court filing in August 2015. The government's filing came after sharp debate between officials at the State and Justice Departments over the strategy to take in the case."
3803,21506,"Marc Riboud, Photojournalist Who Found Grace in the Turbulent, Dies at 93 - The NY Times",NY Times,Richard B. Woodward,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Marc Riboud, the celebrated French photojournalist who captured moments of grace even in the most fraught situations around the world, died in Paris on Tuesday. He was 93. The cause was Alzheimer's disease, his wife, Catherine Chaine, said. Mr. Riboud's career of more than 60 years carried him routinely to turbulent places throughout Asia and Africa in the 1950s and '60s, but he may be best remembered for two photographs taken in the developed world. The first, from 1953, is of a workman poised like an angel in overalls between a lattice of girders while painting the Eiffel Tower  —   one hand raising a paintbrush, one leg bent in a seemingly Chaplinesque attitude. The second, from 1967, is of a young woman presenting a flower to a phalanx of   members of the National Guard during an   War demonstration at the Pentagon. Both images were published in Life magazine during what is often called the golden age of photojournalism, an era Mr. Riboud (pronounced  ) exemplified. A protégé of Henri   he was on the front lines of world events, including wars. Even so, Mr. Riboud did not consider himself a record keeper. “I have shot very rarely news,” he once said. Rather than portray the military parades or political leaders of the Soviet Union, for example, he was drawn to anonymous citizens sitting in the snow, holding miniature chess boards and absorbed in their books. Of the many hundreds of shots he published from Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Pakistan, Tibet and Turkey, only a handful are of figures written about by historians. Born on June 24, 1923, in St.   near Lyon, he was the fifth and, by his account, the most shy of seven children from a bourgeois family that expected him to take up a respectable vocation. It was his father, an enthusiastic traveler and amateur photographer, who led him astray by giving him a   Kodak when Marc was a teenager. His first photographs were of the Paris Exposition in 1937. After World War II, in which he fought around Vercors as a member of the Resistance, Mr. Riboud studied mechanical engineering at the École Centrale in Lyon. He took a factory job in the nearby town of Villeurbanne after graduating in 1948. Not until he found himself taking pictures of a cultural festival in Lyon during a weeklong vacation in 1951 did he at last decide to commit to the unstable life of a freelance photojournalist. He moved to Paris in 1952. There he met   who became his mentor. Already a celebrity in his field, this “salutary tyrant,” as Mr. Riboud called him, dictated “which books to read, what political ideas I should have, which museums and galleries to visit. ” “He taught me about life and about the art of photography,” Mr. Riboud said. Among the lessons imparted was that “good photography” is dependent on “good geometry. ” The Eiffel Tower photograph from 1953, the first that Mr. Riboud published, proves how well the pupil absorbed the lesson. In a radio interview more than 50 years later, he still recalled the   caption given to the image by the Life copy writers: “  on the Eiffel. ” In 1953,   nominated his protégé to join Magnum, the photo collective he had helped found. Until 1979, when he left to go out on his own, Mr. Riboud traveled and photographed for the agency constantly. In 1955, he drove a specially equipped Land Rover to Calcutta from Paris, staying for a year in India. He was also one of the first Westerners to photograph in Communist China, and he spent three months in the Soviet Union in 1960. Throughout the 1950s and '60s he documented the anticolonial independence movements in Algeria and West Africa, and during the Vietnam War he was among the few able to move easily between the North and South. In the USA, he documented not only protests against the Vietnam War but also a pensive Maureen Dean listening to her husband, the Nixon aide John W. Dean, testify at the Watergate hearings in 1973. Among the events he documented in recent decades were the return of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to Iran the Solidarity movement in Poland the trial of Klaus Barbie, the Gestapo chief in Lyon during World War II the end of apartheid in South Africa and the mood in the USA before the election of Obama. During the last third of his life, Mr. Riboud was recognized by museums in many of the countries where he had worked. Photographs from his travels were collected in more than a dozen monographs, including “Marc Riboud: Photographs at Home and Abroad” (1986) “Marc Riboud: Journal” (1988) and “Marc Riboud in China: Forty Years of Photography” (1996). Among many other shows, Mr. Riboud was honored with exhibitions at the Art Institute of Chicago, in 1964, and the International Center of Photography in NY, in 1975, 1988 and 1997. He was the subject of retrospectives at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris in 1985 and the Maison Européenne de la Photographie in Paris in 2004. Unlike some artists who resent that the public's infatuation with a few of their works has turned them into clichés, Mr. Riboud did not mind describing the circumstances behind “The Eiffel Tower Painter. ” No, he did not ask the workman to pose, he would answer patiently. To have spoken to the man might have caused him to slip. “I've always been shy, and I've always been trying to ignore the people I was photographing so that they ignore me,” he said. Of the flower girl at the Pentagon, a    high school student named Jan Rose Kasmir, he ventured, “I had the feeling the soldiers were more afraid of her than she was of the bayonets. ” (The two later reunited in London, where he photographed her carrying a poster of the 1967 image at a demonstration against the Iraq War in 2003.) The immense popularity of these two photographs, assisted by countless reproductions, could well have warped perceptions of Mr. Riboud's highly diverse body of work. And yet they did truly represent the gravitational bent of his personality. “I have always been more sensitive to the beauty of the world than to violence and monsters,” he wrote in an essay in 2000. “My obsession is with photographing life at its most intense as intensely as possible. It's a mania, a virus as strong as my instinct to be free. If taste for life diminishes, the photographs pale, because taking pictures is like savoring life at 125th of a second. ” In 1961, he married Barbara Chase, the American sculptor, poet and novelist. The marriage ended in divorce in the 1980s. Besides his second wife, Ms. Chaine, a journalist and author, Mr. Riboud is survived by two sons from his first marriage, David and Alexei and a daughter, Clémence, and a son, Théo, from his second marriage. Mr. Riboud's weakness for sentimental subjects and   causes marred his reputation with some critics. But this optimism, coupled with his overt sympathies for the downtrodden and a working style that put an emphasis on freedom of movement, unencumbered by any equipment except a camera and his wits, also served to keep him photographing until the end of his life. Until a few years ago, he would begin each day by loading film into his Canon EOS 300. “My vision of the world is simple,” Mr. Riboud said when he was in his 80s. “Tomorrow, each new day, I want to see the city, take new photographs, meet people and wander alone. ”"
3805,21508,A Silicon Valley Dream Collapses in Allegations of Fraud - The NY Times,NY Times,Katie Benner,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   Like so many bright, young entrepreneurs these days, Isaac Choi arrived here last year, set up shop and promised employees that he would lead them to the Silicon Valley dream. That dream is turning out mostly to be a mirage. This week, Mr. Choi's company, WrkRiot, began unraveling in a highly public fashion. Its former head of marketing revealed that the   had been mired in internal chaos and had sometimes paid employees in cashier's checks before delaying payment altogether. She also alleged that Mr. Choi had forged wire transfer documents to make it look as if compensation were on the way. By late Tuesday, WrkRiot had taken itself offline. The veracity of Mr. Choi's credentials are now also in question. While WrkRiot is not widely known, the  's collapse has gripped Silicon Valley. Mr. Choi's situation may be extreme, but the company's implosion has a familiar ring to many who came west to be the next Mark Zuckerberg  —   but ended up instead at the next WrkRiot. Silicon Valley is always eager to celebrate its success stories, but the reality is that numerous tiny   that few ever hear about form the tech industry's dysfunctional underbelly. “With the exception of the alleged fraud, almost anyone who has worked at a   has experienced most everything that went wrong at WrkRiot,” said Semil Shah, a   investor based in Menlo Park, Calif. “People don't realize the word   is a broad concept that includes everything from a proven entrepreneur raising $15 million to a guy with money from friends and family. ” To an outsider, he said, “they're both the same. ” On Hacker News, an online forum for techies, WrkRiot's tale has exploded into one of the most popular threads, attracting more than 500 comments, including one from a poster who said that the  's experience “is pretty much a rite of passage here. ” Tech blogs have also seized the tale one called it “one of the ugliest   stories we've ever heard. ” Penny Kim, the former head of marketing at WrkRiot who wrote about her experience at the company, including the forgery allegations, said, “I'd heard stories about late paychecks or   failing, but who expects fraud in Silicon Valley?” WrkRiot terminated Ms. Kim's employment in   after she filed a wage claim. She has since filed a retaliation complaint against the company and moved to Dallas, where she previously lived. In an interview this week, Mr. Choi, 35, said WrkRiot, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif. near where Intel has its headquarters, was “like any company. If you want to talk   all   have problems. ” When asked about the forgery claims, Mr. Choi said Ms. Kim was a disgruntled employee who was fired for cause and that the accusations were “unfair to my guys. ” Along with the   Mr. Choi's personal credibility is on the line. As he built WrkRiot, the entrepreneur said that he graduated from the Stern School of Business at NY University and that he worked at J. P. Morgan for nearly four years as an analyst. N. Y. U. and J. P. Morgan both said they had no record of Mr. Choi. At least one company listed on his LinkedIn profile also could not be found. Mr. Choi, whose LinkedIn profile has since been wiped clean, did not respond to questions about his résumé. His lawyer, Bernard Fishman, said he was not aware of the allegations against WrkRiot until contacted by The NY Times. Mr. Choi set up his   in June 2015 under the name 1For. One, with a mission of helping people find the perfect job online. He brought in advisers with expertise in recruiting and data science and eventually hired nearly 20 employees, including Chinese nationals under work visas. The company later changed its name to JobSonic with a tagline, “Finally, a lightning fast job platform that cares. ” Eventually, the   settled on the   name of WrkRiot. Mr. Choi said the company had not raised any money from venture capital firms but that he had “a bunch of private investors who are    individuals who believe in the company. ” He said one investor was related to him and one was not, but would not say how much money the company had. WrkRiot's former chief technology officer and   Al Brown, said Mr. Choi had intended to put $2 million of his own money into the company, but that only $400, 000 materialized. “I did not find out till the beginning of August that the money for the last payroll came from one of the employees,” Mr. Brown wrote in online comments this week. In Ms. Kim's post about her experience at the company, which she did not initially identify but later confirmed was WrkRiot, she wrote that the   without consulting her, hired someone who would report to her, did not plan ahead on its business  —   and had no idea what its business really was  —   and was repeatedly turned down by investors. The chief executive, later identified as Mr. Choi, also borrowed money from employees, she said. “Nothing about that   surprises me anymore and it all seems like a horrible nightmare I was lucky enough to wake up from,” she wrote. Since Ms. Kim's disclosures, others have told her they were also shortchanged by  . Michelle Young, the founder of the online travel guide Untapped Cities, reached out to Ms. Kim to tell her about an undisclosed   that bought ad space from her company  —   but then stopped paying. Ms. Young was eventually offered $40, 000 in guaranteed business by the   if she agreed to a nondisparagement clause. She did not sign and is still waiting for some of the money she is owed. “At some point the checks stopped coming,” said Ms. Young. “There were warning signs. Offers that seemed too good to be true. ” After Ms. Kim's post, several of WrkRiot's advisers and former employees moved to distance themselves from the company. Daniel Tunkelang, a former WrkRiot adviser who has worked at LinkedIn and been a consultant at Pinterest, terminated his relationship with the company and wrote in a blog post, “I should have gotten to know the company and its leadership better before associating myself with them and lending them my credibility. ” At WrkRiot, a handful of the  's remaining 10 or so employees gathered on Tuesday night to discuss their situation, according to a person who attended the gathering and spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was concerned about retaliation. A few were hopeful that Mr. Choi could save the company. Some of the Chinese nationals whose work visas are tied to their employment said their visa extensions were in limbo, partly because WrkRiot had missed a payment to the   company ADP, making it impossible for the government to verify their employment through ADP. By then, WrkRiot had shut down its website, its Facebook page and its Twitter account. Many of the employees are now hunting for other Silicon Valley   jobs."
3806,21509,Never the Noodles Shall Meet: A Chinese Treaty Is Tested - The NY Times,NY Times,Emily Feng,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Amid the modern skyscrapers of Shanghai, the parties to a   treaty are at war. At stake are the spoils of a   industry and a minority group's ability to retain its customs in a   China. Also, noodles. When Xian Gulin opened a halal restaurant in Shanghai last month that serves   beef noodles, he hoped patrons would line up at his door. What he got instead was an entrance blocked for weeks by protesters. The protesters, like Mr. Xian, were Hui, a Muslim ethnic minority, originally from China's northwest. They accused the restaurateur of violating the    Treaty, a social pact that prohibits the Hui from opening halal noodle shops within 400 meters of each other  —   roughly 1, 300 feet. To appease the protesters, Mr. Xian eventually agreed to take down the halal insignia from his storefront. The origins of the treaty are unknown, but restaurateurs say it originally capped the number of noodle shops in a Hui village at one. As more Hui began moving eastward into China's growing coastal cities, they brought a variant of the treaty with them. “For the Hui as a community, maintaining their halal traditions and restaurants has been critical to their survival, so it's not surprising that in a highly capitalized society, these rivalries would bubble to the surface,” said Dru Gladney, an anthropology professor at Pomona College in California and an expert on Chinese ethnic minorities. The halal food industry has flourished in China as the country has pursued closer economic relations with   Middle Eastern nations. In Qinghai Province alone, sales of halal food products in 2014 totaled about $2. 8 billion. On Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, online commenters condemned the protests. Even the Islamic Association of Qinghai got involved, declaring the boycott of Mr. Xian's restaurant a violation of “fair competition” that caused “social instability. ” Still, Hui restaurateurs insist that the treaty is more necessary than ever. “We worked so hard to climb our way up, so we can't tolerate people who do not respect the treaty,” said Ma Yi Buo La, 37, who owns a halal noodle shop in Shanghai. “People who don't abide by the treaty, they're not good people,” he said. Yet enforcement of the treaty is increasingly difficult as halal cuisine becomes more popular across China. “It was a tradition in our villages back home, but I don't think anyone really respects this treaty anymore in large cities,” said Ma Kefu, 19, a Gansu native who now works at a halal restaurant in Beijing. To make his point, he gestured across the street. No more than 15 feet away stood another halal restaurant, its intricate halal insignia prominently on display."
3807,21510,"North Korea Has Executed a Deputy Premier, Seoul Reports - The NY Times",NY Times,Choe Sang-Hun,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"SEOUL, South Korea  —   The North Korean leader, Kim   has executed his deputy premier for education and purged two other senior officials, sending them to   camps, the South Korean government said on Wednesday. Jeong   a spokesman for the South's Unification Ministry, said at a news briefing that the South Korean government had used various means to confirm the execution of Kim   the deputy premier, and the purge of Kim   the head of the United Front Department of the ruling Workers' Party, which handles relations with, as well as spying operations against, South Korea. Choe Hui, a deputy chief of the party's Propaganda and Agitation Department, was also banished for   Mr. Jeong said. Mr. Jeong provided no further details, including when the reported punishments were believed to have taken place or how South Korea had learned of them. But in a later briefing, a senior Unification Ministry official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, said that Kim   had found fault with the    deputy premier's “disrespectful posture” during a meeting that Mr. Kim oversaw in late June. A subsequent investigation found the deputy premier to be an “  reactionary” guilty of “  factionalism,” and he was executed by firing squad in July, the official said. Kim   would be the   official known to have been executed since 2013, when North Korea confirmed in a rare announcement that Kim   had executed his own uncle and No. 2 official, Jang   on charges of factionalism, corruption and plotting to overthrow his government. The ministry official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that Kim   the leader of the United Front Department, had spent a month at a   camp on suspicion of abuse of power and that he had been released in  . Kim   is seen as a   by South Korean officials. He was accused of helping orchestrate recent armed provocations by the North along the   border, including an artillery barrage against a South Korean island in 2010, when he was the army's intelligence chief. The Unification Ministry official said Mr. Kim would now need to prove his loyalty, which the official said raised the possibility that the North could take more aggressive actions toward South Korea. Since taking power in 2011, Kim   has frequently reshuffled the party and military elites as he has consolidated his authority in North Korea, which his family has ruled for seven decades. Mr. Kim has also executed dozens of top officials in what President Park   of South Korea has called a “reign of terror,” according to South Korean intelligence officials. It remains difficult to independently verify  reports of executions and purges in the secretive North. North Korea rarely announces them. It was unusual for a South Korean government spokesman to make them public in an open news briefing, though intelligence officials have often briefed lawmakers in   parliamentary sessions. In one such briefing last year, lawmakers were told that Gen. Hyon   the defense minister, had been executed with an antiaircraft gun in Pyongyang, the North's capital, after dozing off during military events and   Mr. Kim's orders. Mr. Jeong, the government spokesman, said that he was responding to recent reports in the South Korean news media. On Tuesday, the   daily JoongAng Ilbo, citing an anonymous source, reported that Hwang Min, a former North Korean agriculture minister, and Ri   a senior Education Ministry official, had been executed with antiaircraft guns in early August. The newspaper reported that Mr. Ri had been arrested after dozing off during a meeting supervised by Mr. Kim and that Mr. Hwang had proposed a policy that was deemed to represent a challenge to Mr. Kim's leadership. Mr. Jeong did not comment on the fates of those two officials in his briefing on Wednesday. JoongAng Ilbo reported that the officials' reported executions might have been aimed at tightening Mr. Kim's control after a senior North Korean diplomat's recent defection to the South. South Korean officials often cite such   defections, and purges like those announced Wednesday, as potential sources of instability in Mr. Kim's totalitarian regime. But some analysts dispute such conclusions. Purges and executions remain a key feature of political life in the North, said Cheong   a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute, a South Korean research organization. But he said such persecutions, while barbaric, had become less frequent and “relatively restrained” under Kim  . Mr. Kim's father, Kim   was estimated to have purged more than 2, 000 officials from 1994 to 2000, he said."
3808,21511,Obama to Guest-Edit Wired Magazine - The NY Times,NY Times,Niraj Chokshi,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"It is perhaps only fitting that a president who rose to power by harnessing the internet would   one of the nation's leading technology and science magazines on the way out. Obama will take on that duty in the November issue of Wired, the magazine announced on Tuesday. It will be available on newsstands nationwide on Oct. 25, two weeks before Election Day. By Wired's estimation, it will be the first time a sitting president has   a magazine, a move the editor, Scott Dadich, described as a natural choice, given the nation's history of innovation. “When the founders wrote the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, they were at the bleeding edge of enlightenment philosophy and technology,” Mr. Dadich said in the announcement. “Franklin was talking about crazy stuff like electricity and communications networks. Paine gave up the copyright to Common Sense so it could get wider publication. Jefferson was radically rethinking design and land use. ” At Mr. Obama's direction, the issue will focus on the future, the magazine said. Its theme will be frontiers: personal, local, national, international and beyond. (Think precision medicine, urban planning, civil rights, climate change and space travel.) That theme will also serve as the subject of a White House conference, a convening of innovators, to be held in Pittsburgh earlier in October and to be   by the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. The president is no stranger to science, technology and Silicon Valley, subjects central to Wired's coverage. His first presidential campaign is often credited to an effective use of big data and the internet. and he has championed several ambitious initiatives while in office, including plans to map the human brain and to get 20 million people subscribed to   internet by 2020. Last year, Mr. Obama famously dined late into the night at the White House with 13 guests, including Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn's   John Doerr, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and Vinod Khosla, a founder of Sun Microsystems  —   part of a broader effort to prepare an infrastructure and endowment that would be used for, among other things, a “digital first” presidential library. Mr. Obama also courted support from Silicon Valley professionals, some of whom were rewarded for their efforts. John V. Roos, a major   and a former law firm partner there, was appointed ambassador to Japan after Mr. Obama first took office. The Wired arrangement won't be the president's first foray into editing, either. In 1990, he  became the first black editor in the history of the Harvard Law Review."
3809,21512,"Dr. Joy Browne, Long-Running Psychologist of the Airwaves, Dies at 71 - The NY Times",NY Times,Sam Roberts,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Dr. Joy Browne, the syndicated radio and television psychologist who dispensed advice and earnest inspiration over the air for nearly four decades, died on Saturday in Manhattan. She was 71 and still hosting her daily   radio program. Her death was confirmed by her brother David Oppenheim, who did not give a cause. Beginning in 1978  —   when she was suddenly thrust onto the air because a hockey game had been canceled  —   Dr. Browne reached millions of radio listeners, many of whom revealed their concerns to her in cathartic   segments or emailed her their problems, which she read and responded to over the air. “She was the   psychologist on   radio at the time of her death,” Michael Harrison, the publisher of Talkers magazine, said in an email on Wednesday. “More importantly,” he added, “she kept the presence of the radio   show alive on terrestrial   radio at a time when the genre had all but dried up in favor of mostly conservative, political programming. ” On television, versions of her program appeared on CBS, with a studio audience, and on the Discovery Health cable channel. In contrast to other   psychologists, some of whom could come across as scolds, Dr. Browne was unflaggingly buoyant as she delivered   advice and gentle goading. “I'm in the business of helping make lives better,” she once said, “not by bashing but by teaching people how to take responsibility for their behavior. ” On a recent program she asked: “If we can figure out a way to get to the moon, wipe out disease, double life expectancy, don't you think we can be a little nicer to each other? Maybe. I know, I believe in the Easter bunny and the Tooth Fairy as well. ” With her advice came rules to live by, like these for couples: ¶If you're married, go on dates together (to keep the romance alive). ¶If you've gone through a divorce or a breakup, no dating for a year (to let you experience life on your own). ¶If you're both in love and either of you has children, get married (an unmarried state can be disruptive for younger children, who tend to become attached, and for teenagers, who are dealing with their own sexuality). The psychologist Dr. Joyce Brothers, who became a fixture in American homes, made her television debut in the 1950s, but the roots of radio therapy are usually traced to Toni Grant, who started broadcasting on   in Los Angeles in 1975. (Dr. Grant died this year.) Dr. Browne was among those who followed in her footsteps, in her case on   (now WMEX) in Boston. “When I first started, the A. P. A. tried to take my license away,” Dr. Browne told The NY Times in 1996, referring to the American Psychological Association. In 1998, the group gave her an award under the rubric “outstanding contribution by a psychologist in the media. ” Dr. Browne found her niche in the 1970s, at a time when seeking professional help was still stigmatized and family and community support networks had weakened. Radio gave people wrestling with emotional issues the safety of anonymity. She said she was as much concerned with moral and ethical issues as she was with mental health. “It's Problem Solving 101,” she said in 1996 (while acknowledging that some listeners might consider it “Voyeurism 102”). Indeed, Dr. Frank Farley, a former president of the psychological association and a professor at Temple University, said in a phone interview on Wednesday that   programs like Dr. Browne's were more successful at offering practical advice on ethical issues than at providing actual therapy in public. “You can't give therapy to people you haven't seen,” he said. He added: “Joy Browne was certainly among the best of the media psychologists. She was very solid,   in psychology, and wasn't going to be shooting from the lip. ” She was born Joy Oppenheim on Oct. 24, 1944, in New Orleans, the daughter of Nelson Oppenheim, a life insurance salesman, and the former Ruth Strauss, a teacher. She was raised in Pennsylvania and Denver and graduated from Rice University in Houston with a degree in behavioral science. After earning a master's degree and a doctorate from Northeastern University in Boston, she began practicing psychology and attending Tufts University School of Medicine. That was when she was recruited by WITS. “I found something in my life I was good at and could help more people in one hour than I could in one year,” Dr. Browne told Talkers magazine last year. (She took her husband's name when she married Carter Browne.) WITS had scheduled her to begin broadcasting in October 1978, but weeks earlier she was summoned one night without warning to fill in when a scheduled broadcast of a Bruins hockey game was abruptly canceled the ice had melted at Boston Garden. Her mission, she said, was to persuade depressed listeners that they could change only their   not those of the people who might be causing them stress. “They want to know how to kill the person who is making them feel that way and not be held responsible,” she told Talkers. “The only behavior I can help change is yours, but that isn't what a caller wants to hear. They want me to tell them that the other person is to blame. ” She also learned, she said, that “one secret to doing a great interview is listening,” a skill she had already developed as a therapist. Certain topics were taboo, she said, including abortion, “because you will never change anyone's mind,” and horoscopes, “because it will get phone calls  —   but no listeners. ” Partisan politics was also off limits. After another radio stint in California, Dr. Browne joined the WOR Radio Network in NY, which in the early 1990s sent her program into national syndication. She remained at WOR until it was sold in 2012. She then shifted to Radio America and finally to Genesis Communications Network, where her midday program was still being broadcast on more than 100 stations at her death. Dr. Browne was also an author. Among her titles are “The Nine Fantasies That Will Ruin Your Life” (1998) “It's a Jungle Out There, Jane” (1999) “Getting Unstuck” (2002) “Dating Disasters” (2005) and “Dating for Dummies” (2006) which includes this   tip: “If you have fingernail marks on the palms of your hands, you're a little too tense. ” Her marriage to Mr. Browne ended in divorce. In addition to her brother David, she is survived by a daughter, Patience three sisters, Jane Russo, Judy Hawkins and Alannah Sinclaire and another brother, Daniel Oppenheim. Embracing the    philosophy, Dr. Browne imposed one rule on herself: No chocolate during Lent. “That keeps me humble,” she said. “I'm always telling people to do things to change. This is my yearly reminder to myself that change is really hard. ”"

4433,22197,North Dakota Oil Pipeline Battle: Who's Fighting and Why - The NY Times,NY Times,Jack Healy,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Updated on Dec. 2, 2016 Since the spring, thousands of people have gathered near Cannon Ball, N. D. to protest the construction of a an oil pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The protests have occasionally resulted in violent clashes with law enforcement. During one tense confrontation last month, an explosion badly damaged one demonstrator's arm in what was among the most serious injuries of the clashes. This week, as heavy snow blanketed the plains, Gov Jack Dalrymple of North Dakota ordered a mandatory evacuation of the area where the demonstrations are taking place, as more activists have vowed to join the protest. Here is a look at how the battle over the   pipeline has become an environmental and cultural flash point, stirring passions across social media and drawing thousands of protesters to camp out in rural North Dakota. Native Americans from scores of tribes have been gathering outside Cannon Ball  —   a town in   North Dakota, near the South Dakota border  —   to protest the Dakota Access pipeline. Starting with members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the protest has since grown to hundreds of people (estimates vary) most of them from Native American tribes across the country. Last month, hundreds clashed with law enforcement officials who used water to repel protesters in   weather, attracting more attention to the conflict. During that confrontation, Sophia Wilansky, 21, who grew up in the Bronx, suffered one of the most serious injuries of the movement, her arm badly damaged from an explosion whose origin remains in dispute. As many as 2, 000 veterans plan to join the demonstrators next week to serve as “human shields” against what they describe as a “militarized police force. ” In all, hundreds of people have been arrested since the protests began to attract widespread attention late this summer. The Dakota Access pipeline is a $3. 7 billion project that would carry 470, 000 barrels of oil a day from the oil fields of western North Dakota to Illinois, where it would be linked with other pipelines. Energy Transfer says the pipeline will pump millions of dollars into local economies and create 8, 000 to 12, 000 construction jobs  —   though far fewer permanent jobs to maintain and monitor the pipeline. Members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe see the pipeline as a major environmental and cultural threat. They say its route traverses ancestral lands  —   which are not part of the reservation  —   where their forebears hunted, fished and were buried. They say historical and cultural reviews of the land where the pipeline will be buried were inadequate. They also worry about catastrophic environmental damage if the pipeline were to break near where it crosses under the Missouri River. As of early December, the federal government was still not allowing the pipeline company to drill under the river to finish a critical section that would link the pipeline together. The Army Corps of Engineers said in   that it wanted to hear more from the Standing Rock Sioux, citing the importance of the water to the tribe as well as a long, painful history of lands' being taken from the tribes. It is unclear whether the corps will ultimately allow or block the pipeline. It is also anyone's guess when it will make a final decision. Yes. State and federal agencies have approved the pipeline, and some farmers and ranchers have welcomed the thousands of dollars in payments that came with signing agreements to allow it to cross their land. But others oppose the pipeline. In Iowa, one of the four states that the pipeline would traverse, some farmers have gone to court to keep it off their land. They say that Iowa regulators were wrong to grant the pipeline company the power of eminent domain to force its way through their farms. Most landowners in the   path of the pipeline through Iowa, however, have signed easements allowing it to be built across their land. The USA has a web of 2. 5 million miles of pipelines that carry products like oil and natural gas, pumping them to processing and treatment plants, power plants, homes and businesses. Most of the lines are buried, but some run above ground. While a natural gas line to a newly built subdivision is not likely to generate national controversy, proposed major pipelines like the Keystone XL, the Dakota Access or the Sandpiper in northern Minnesota have generated huge opposition from environmental groups and people living in their paths. Energy companies and their federal overseer, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, promote  the safety record of pipelines. Pipeline companies say it is far safer to move oil and natural gas in an underground pipe than in rail cars or trucks, which can crash and create huge fires. But pipeline spills and ruptures occur regularly. Sometimes the leaks are small, and sometimes they are catastrophic gushers. In 2013, a Tesoro Logistics pipeline in North Dakota broke open and spilled 865, 000 gallons of oil onto a farm. In 2010, an Enbridge Energy pipeline dumped more than 843, 000 gallons of oil into the Kalamazoo River in Michigan, resulting in a cleanup that lasted years and cost more than a billion dollars, according to Inside Climate News. In a 2012 examination of pipeline safety, ProPublica reported that more than half of the country's pipelines were at least 50 years old. Critics cited aging pipelines and scant federal oversight as factors that put public health and the environment at risk."
4671,22464,"Review: ‘Allied,' With Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard, Uncorks a Favorite Vintage - The NY Times",NY Times,A. O. Scott,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"“Allied,” Robert Zemeckis's deft and diverting World War II romantic thriller, operates a bit like “Casablanca” in reverse. It's about how the problems in this crazy world don't amount to a hill of beans next to the troubles of two people in love. The singing of “La Marseillaise” figures prominently and tearfully in the plot. The city of Casablanca itself functions for the lovers, played by Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard, much in the way that Paris does for Ilsa and Rick. It's the scene of their first bliss, the place they'll always have when things get complicated elsewhere. I don't want to press the comparison too far. For one thing, there is more Alfred Hitchcock than Michael Curtiz in this movie's DNA. For another, whereas “Casablanca” put forth a     call to arms, “Allied” offers the comforts of elegant escapism. Its moral complexities and political ambiguities are intriguing rather than troubling, its ethical and emotional agonies a diversion from rather than a reflection of our own. Which is just fine with me. There are nits to pick, of course. Mr. Pitt, playing a Canadian wing commander in the Royal Air Force, has apparently drawn inspiration from the trees in the great forests of the North. He is handsome, trim and efficient, but the same might be said of a wooden canoe, and his character's stoical reserve often feels more like an empty space than a deep pool of untapped feeling. This changes toward the end, but the final minutes of “Allied” also provide some grounds for complaint. They are puffy and sentimental, the cinematic equivalent of a cloying dessert following an otherwise   meal. If I may pursue the culinary metaphor, and supplement it with a different comparison: “Allied,” while neither haute cuisine or haute couture, is like an expertly tailored suit or a properly cooked classic dish. It's not so much a work of art as a triumph of craft, and therefore a reminder of the deep pleasures of   technique and long experience. Mr. Zemeckis has made more ambitious, more dazzling films  —   as a dogmatic   my list of favorites would include “Back to the Future,” “Who Framed Roger Rabbit” and “Cast Away”  —   but this one may be the purest and most relaxed demonstration of his mastery. Like Steven Spielberg's “Bridge of Spies,” it infuses a venerable genre and a familiar period with new interest. The first shot, of Mr. Pitt's character, Max Vatan, parachuting into the Moroccan desert, is hypnotically beautiful and strange. Your eye keeps recalibrating the perspective, anticipating Max's touchdown when he is still far above the ground and then blinking in surprise when he finally lands. The rest of the film produces a similar effect, teasing your expectations and concealing cards in its impeccable sleeves. Once in Casablanca, Max is introduced to Marianne Beauséjour, a French resistance fighter who is his partner on a dangerous mission. Their orders are to pretend that they are married, and they end up giving themselves wholeheartedly to the performance, and to each other. Marianne explains that part of her method is to make sure that, whatever the details of the imposture, the feeling is real. That assertion will haunt the second half of the movie, which follows the couple to London. At this point I'm reluctant  —   though not as reluctant as some of the trailers  —   to say more. “Allied” is, among other things, a marvel of structure, a perfectly bifurcated story that manages a drastic shift in tone with exquisite aplomb. Max and Marianne set up house in Hampstead she gives birth to a daughter during an air raid he commutes to a mostly deskbound job, and the audience is free to appreciate the work of a superb supporting cast that includes Jared Harris, Lizzy Caplan and Simon McBurney. Ordinary life during wartime  —   a shuffle of tedium and hysteria, bureaucratic entanglement and everyday pleasures  —   is evoked in fine detail. Mr. Zemeckis and the screenwriter, Steven Knight, plant almost imperceptible clues that blossom into sinister and scary possibilities in a way that is both shocking and satisfying. You have an itchy premonition that something terrible is going to happen, and when it does the itch is scratched. “Standard operating procedure for intimate betrayal” is a military catchphrase that haunts “Allied,” a plausible portrait of a midcentury marriage that is also a fantastical piece of  'oeil storytelling. Ms. Cotillard, in a remarkable series of frocks, hats, coats and trouser suits, is the key to the film's spell. Is Marianne a stylized   feminine ideal, or a film noir femme fatale  —   or something else entirely, a modern woman decked out in Hollywood   ? You would not mistake this for an old movie. The language is too raw, the sexuality too frank, the politics too cloudy. But you might nonetheless feel like an older kind of moviegoer while you're watching it: an adult, for one thing, whose intelligence is respected by an intricate, thematically thorny plot even as your thirst for visceral excitement is slaked by clean and breathless action sequences. You also get to look at beautiful people in (and half out of) beautiful clothes. The fundamental things apply. “Allied” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). I'm shocked  —   shocked  —   to find swearing, sex and smoking going on in this establishment. Running time: 1 hour 56 minutes."
4704,22505,"‘Vulture' or ‘Phoenix'? Wilbur Ross, Risk-Taker, Is Eyed for Commerce Post - The NY Times",NY Times,Matthew Goldstein,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Wilbur L. Ross, the billionaire investor expected to be nominated as the next commerce secretary, has made his fortune through the tricky business of buying deeply troubled companies. With wealth estimated at $2. 9 billion, Mr. Ross, who turns 79 on Monday, would join a cabinet that is already expected to include one of the superwealthy in Betsy DeVos, the nominee for secretary of education, and that may soon have others. In choosing Mr. Ross to be the face of American business for the rest of the world,   Donald J. Trump is turning not to a cautious corporate chieftain, but to a   speculator. Like his presumptive boss, Mr. Ross has been considered either a hero or a villain during his career. There is not a lot in between. In 2002, he won praise from workers when he bought the shuttered steel mills of LTV, a bankrupt company in Cleveland. Four years later, Mr. Ross was pilloried after an explosion at the Sago Mine in West Virginia, which his company had bought a few weeks earlier, killed 12 miners. The stark contrasts reflect the nature of the world in which Mr. Ross operates: distressed investing. He made his name scouring the landscape for businesses left for dead that he could sink money into and then profit from when they were resurrected. It is a business that requires nerves of steel and a strong stomach. The chances of failure  —   along with headlines about collapsed businesses and lost jobs  —   are balanced against the opportunity for a big reward if a turnaround strategy works. Some businesses where he has invested, like textile mills, have struggled. But other investments have salvaged industry and jobs while providing a lucrative payday. His   bet was in the steel industry more than a decade ago, a time when few wanted anything to do with it. Mr. Ross cobbled together the ailing assets of LTV and Bethlehem Steel into a new company called International Steel Group, which was sold in 2004 to Mittal Steel for $4. 5 billion. “There were no outsiders who were willing to step forward and make an investment,” said Ron Bloom, an investment banker who negotiated with Mr. Ross for the United Steelworkers. “He went where angels feared to tread. ” Like his investing, the politics of Mr. Ross, a former Democrat, do not always stick to orthodox points of view. Mr. Ross has expressed strong conservative beliefs on some issues  —   favoring big tax cuts for businesses, for example, and a repeal of Obama's health law. Yet Mr. Ross has also suggested that he is receptive to some of the   views favored by American labor unions and by Mr. Trump. “The president has a huge amount of fire in terms of abrogating treaties, and he can do a lot without reference to Congress,” Mr. Ross said in an interview the day after the election. Mr. Ross, a member of Mr. Trump's economic team during the campaign, said he expected the new president to do a lot on trade and regulation through executive action. “He is serious about suspending any new regulations,” said Mr. Ross, who held one of Mr. Trump's first  . A spokesman for Mr. Trump, Jason Miller, said: “Though   Trump has not yet announced his pick for this position, it goes without saying that Mr. Ross has been a fantastic advocate for the  's plan to bring back jobs, eliminate the trade deficit and make good deals for America's workers. ” The nomination of Mr. Ross would be the capstone to a career on Wall Street that has spanned decades and has made him one of the most visible and successful of a breed of investor known as “vultures” because of their penchant for going after nearly dead businesses. Mr. Ross, by contrast, has often preferred to see himself as another kind of bird  —   the mythical phoenix, helping businesses rise from the ashes. To some degree, Mr. Ross helped Mr. Trump do that when some of his casinos in Atlantic City fell on hard times. Mr. Ross and Carl C. Icahn, another billionaire investor and supporter of Mr. Trump, were both bondholders in the Trump Taj Mahal casino when it was teetering on financial collapse in 1990. Instead of pushing the casino into an immediate bankruptcy, Mr. Ross and Mr. Icahn worked with Mr. Trump and others to structure a more orderly bankruptcy filing in 1991. The negotiated restructuring helped Mr. Trump salvage his name and brand at a time when he arguably did not have many friends on Wall Street. The low point of Mr. Ross's career was the deadly mine disaster in West Virginia. Although he helped set up a charitable fund for the families of the victims, and his company contributed more than $1 million to them as well, some in organized labor remain bitter about Mr. Ross and his firm. Still, that episode has not deterred some unions from doing business with him when it was in their interest. In 2012, Mr. Ross was one of the wealthy investors who gave a $50 million cash infusion to Amalgamated Bank, one of the nation's largest   lenders, which was struggling to stay in business after the financial crisis. An affiliate of the Service Employees International Union, which controlled the ailing Amalgamated Bank, did not hesitate to take Mr. Ross's money. “Wilbur Ross's investment firm has been an investor in the bank and held a seat on our board for nearly five years,” said Loren Riegelhaupt, a spokesman for Amalgamated Bank. “While we appreciate his financial acumen, his relationship to the bank has never impacted our core progressive principles: providing quality financial services to our clients while advancing the values we believe in. ” Mr. Ross sold his firm in 2006 to Invesco, an   investment company, for about $375 million. Since then, he has pulled back on the daily operations of the business. While remaining as chairman of the firm, Mr. Ross has spent more time in recent years at his Palm Beach, Fla. home, not far from Mr. Trump's    estate. Mr. Ross was born in Weehawken, N. J. and has been married three times. His second wife, Betsy McCaughey, a Republican, served as NY's lieutenant governor from 1995 to 1998. The experience, Mr. Ross would later tell NY magazine, “gave one a very   view of politics. ” Ms. McCaughey, too, was named to Mr. Trump's economic team during the campaign. Some suggest Mr. Ross's business ties may pose potential conflicts of interest. But the sale of his company, W. L. Ross, may make it easier for Mr. Ross to separate himself from its   interests, which include businesses in Europe, China and India. His remaining financial interests in the firm's funds could be put in a blind trust, and he could easily resign from the five corporate boards on which he sits. Still, those overseas deals could raise questions about his relationships with foreign leaders and businesspeople from China and Russia. He is vice chairman of the Bank of Cyprus, the biggest bank in that European island nation, and he is credited with helping the bank to recover from a severe crisis in 2013. But Mr. Ross's investment in the bank also makes him a de facto business partner with Viktor F. Vekselberg, one of Russia's most prominent businesspeople and a man with ties to the Kremlin. Mr. Ross has complained about China's having taken jobs from Americans  —   a message similar to the one Mr. Trump repeated throughout his campaign. Yet for all the   commentary, Mr. Ross has been a frequent visitor in the past two decades and has made inroads in that country's energy industry. Mr. Ross linked up with the most powerful player in the country's power generation business, China Huaneng Group, in 2008. The   company had been run for years by the eldest son of Li Peng, the former prime minister who was the godfather of the country's electricity industry."
4764,22573,‘Moonlight' Makes a Strong Showing at the Gotham Awards - The NY Times,NY Times,Cara Buckley,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"“Moonlight,” Barry Jenkins's celebrated, intimate portrait of a gay youngster growing up in a   Miami neighborhood, rode into the awards season on a wave of momentum Monday night, scooping up four Gotham Awards, including best feature. “It's a tough film, with a bit of hope in it,” Mr. Jenkins told the Bagger as celebrators and journalists swirled around him, offering hugs and congratulations after the show. “I love that people come out of it with a sense of hope. Whatever we did, it's getting into people, and they see themselves in it. ” Held at Cipriani Wall Street in Lower Manhattan, the   Gothams  —   attendees included Amy Adams, Cate Blanchett, Natalie Portman, Janelle Monáe and a delightfully   Danny DeVito  —   signal the beginning of the movie awards season. The prizes for “Moonlight”  —   it also won best screenplay, best ensemble and the audience award  —   firm up early forecasts that it would be a strong player in the awards race this year. Though the Gothams are not necessarily predictive of the Oscars, its winners for best feature from the previous two years, “Birdman” and “Spotlight,” went on to receive the Academy Award for best picture. Other awardees included Ezra Edelman, who won best documentary for the multipart “O. J.: Made in America,” Casey Affleck, best actor for “Manchester by the Sea,” and Isabelle Huppert for “Elle. ” (On Tuesday, the competition between “Moonlight” and “Manchester by the Sea” was ratcheted up another notch by the National Board of Review. The board named Mr. Jenkins best director of the year, but named “Manchester by the Sea” the year's best film, and Mr. Affleck best actor. Best actress went to Amy Adams, for her star turn in “Arrival. ” Mr. Edelman collected the best documentary award again, while Kenneth Lonergan, who wrote and directed “Manchester,” won for best original screenplay. The rather mysterious board  —   which describes itself as a “select group of film enthusiasts, filmmakers, professionals, academics and students of varying ages and backgrounds”  —   will hold its awards ceremony in Manhattan on Jan. 4.) At the Gothams on Monday night, Mr. Affleck, who is famously fame averse, said while clutching his award onstage, “It feels really good, I got to say. I didn't think I'd care this much. ” A clearly shocked Ms. Huppert said, “I'm stunned I'm breathless,” as the room cheered. “They told me it's a very American award. A very NYer award. And ‘You are French, so you probably won't get it. '” Not surprisingly, given the crowd and the host,   Key, the evening was heavily laced with references  —   overt, sly, heartfelt and arch  —   to   Donald J. Trump. “Here's some silver lining: Thank God he isn't going to live here,” Mr. Key said in his introduction. Oliver Stone, who collected a tribute award, urged    filmmakers to risk being critical of their government if they saw fit. “Don't go easy on what you think is wrong,” Mr. Stone said. “The surveillance state, ‘1984,' cyberwarfare, drone warfare, is with us. This is a major, major issue of our time. I hope you young people will address it. ” After Mr. Stone returned to his seat, Mr. Key jokingly pitched him film ideas from the stage. “How about ‘JFKKK'?” Mr. Key asked. “No? What about ‘Wall Tweet'?” Later, presenting the audience award, the actor Damian Lewis noted how the voting process worked. “This is the best part,” Mr. Lewis said. “The film that receives the most votes is the winner. It's a brilliant idea. ”"
4769,22578,"Trump, a Free-Form Leader, Experiments and Invites Drama - The NY Times",NY Times,Alexander Burns,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"It began at dawn, with a Twitter post about  . In a period of just over 24 hours, stretching from the early hours of Tuesday into Wednesday morning,   Donald J. Trump raced through perhaps the most frenetic day of activity since the election. With a series of surprise announcements and impulsive public gestures, he brought into sharp focus the freewheeling and compulsively theatrical style he will bring to the Oval Office. There was the incendiary pronouncement about the flag: After Fox News aired a segment about protests that included   Mr. Trump suggested stripping people who burned the flag of their citizenship, even though the act is constitutionally protected free speech. There were hazy but   statements of policy: Mr. Trump announced a tentative pact with the   company Carrier to protect some jobs at an Indiana factory, and pledged again to sever ties with his real estate empire, without offering specifics. There was a new and indiscreet round of tryouts for secretary of state, featuring reviews from the   in something like real time. Having paraded David H. Petraeus, the former military commander and C. I. A. director, past a throng of reporters for a meeting on Monday, Mr. Trump dined on Tuesday with Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012 and another candidate for the job. They huddled at a French restaurant on Central Park West in Manhattan, briefly admitting the news media to take photographs of the smiling pair over scallops. On display, if not on the menu, was government à la Trump. While Mr. Trump's focus appeared to careen unpredictably from hour to hour, the larger pattern he followed was a familiar one. As a candidate, Mr. Trump operated largely on gut instinct, with   provocation as his chief tactic. Trusting few people outside a circle of intimates, Mr. Trump thrived in a daily cycle of controversy and cultivated an atmosphere of   drama and division within his campaign. Much as he did during the campaign, Mr. Trump has kept the political world hanging on his every move, no matter how impetuous or trivial. He has aired his partial or fleeting thoughts, toying with the idea of making Rudolph W. Giuliani his secretary of state before appearing to lose interest. He has tolerated and even welcomed unsubtle combat over his selections, allowing a senior adviser, Kellyanne Conway, to roundly attack Mr. Romney on television while he remains a top contender for the cabinet. When Mr. Trump has incited controversy  —   with his   Twitter post, or an earlier allegation of mass voter fraud  —   he has declined to elaborate or justify his claims, and has left aides struggling to defend them, when they have tried at all. Mr. Trump's method, friends and allies say, matches the reputation he built first in NY and then on reality television  —   less as a traditional corporate executive, like Mr. Romney, than as an eager impresario who experimented freely, welcomed conflict and flopped repeatedly. Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House who has advised Mr. Trump, said Mr. Trump's transition process “very much resembles the way he operated in ‘The Apprentice,'” the NBC show in which Mr. Trump functioned as an imposing protagonist subjecting aspiring entrepreneurs to contests of business acumen. Mr. Gingrich said Mr. Trump plainly relished personal contact with possible appointees and favored a   leadership style. Mr. Trump did not emerge, Mr. Gingrich said, from a “corporate, staffed background,” but from a more   improvisational environment. “In a lot of ways, what you're seeing is the continuation of techniques and lessons he learned from doing what was, at one time, the No. 1 TV show,” Mr. Gingrich said. For longtime critics of Mr. Trump, the spectacle of his transition has come as a kind of nightmarish vindication, seeming to confirm their warnings about what it would mean to have a reality television star in the nation's most powerful office. Mr. Trump's rivals in the Republican primary campaign often criticized him as a showman and not a real executive. At a Washington dinner in 2011, Obama ridiculed the notion that Mr. Trump could run for president, recounting an episode of “The Celebrity Apprentice” in which Mr. Trump fired the actor Gary Busey and joking, “These are the kind of decisions that would keep me up at night. ” Jon Lovett, a former speechwriter for Mr. Obama who was an author of his speech belittling Mr. Trump, described a sense of horror at seeing the joke turn into reality. “It is extremely chilling that Trump views the spectacle of choosing cabinet appointments in a way that is similar to deciding whether or not to fire Lil Jon or Joan Rivers,” Mr. Lovett said, referring to contestants on the show. It would be difficult to overstate the extremity of Mr. Trump's departure from recent presidential practice. His immediate predecessors prided themselves on orderly, fastidious deliberations: George W. Bush as the first president with a business degree, Mr. Obama as a candidate branded by aides as “no drama Obama. ” Even Republicans concede that it is not clear how Mr. Trump's   approach to the transition will carry over to governing. Mr. Gingrich predicted during the Republican primary contests that a Trump administration would function as a kind of daily adventure. “If Trump does end up winning, you will have no idea each morning what's going to happen,” he said in a January interview, “because he will have no idea. ” But enacting sweeping changes or passing even modest legislation requires intensive, sustained attention from presidents and their teams, of a kind Mr. Trump has never dedicated to matters of policy. Since the election, Mr. Trump has made only a few   announcements aimed at soothing controversy or bolstering his popularity, like the Carrier deal or his pledge to preserve elements of the Affordable Care Act. But he has not situated any of his pronouncements within a larger, cohesive agenda, or answered even basic questions about them, like whether the terms extended to Carrier should be made available to other companies. Mr. Trump has appeared comparatively uninterested in a set of   appointments in which his close advisers, like Pence, the vice   and Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff, have quietly installed Republican stalwarts. On Tuesday, after Mr. Trump raged on Twitter about   his transition team announced the selection of Elaine L. Chao, a former labor secretary, to lead the Department of Transportation, and Representative Tom Price of Georgia, a conservative   as Mr. Trump's choice for health secretary. On Twitter, Mr. Trump made only one perfunctory mention each of Ms. Chao and Mr. Price, the man who would most likely be tasked with carrying out some of the  's most important campaign promises. By comparison, on Monday and Tuesday, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter twice about the Carrier deal and five times to criticize CNN for its coverage of him. Michael O. Leavitt, a former governor of Utah who prepared Mr. Romney's transition team before the 2012 election, said a presidential transition usually “takes on the personality of the principal. ” Mr. Trump, he said, was taking an exceptionally public approach and showing far less regard than usual for the privacy of job candidates. “This is Trump doing it his way, and no one should expect any different,” Mr. Leavitt said. “That doesn't mean it's right or wrong  —   it's just Trump. ”"

4800,22613,California Today: Meet Your Next Attorney General - The NY Times,NY Times,Mike McPhate,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Sign up.) Let's turn it over to Adam Nagourney, our Los Angeles bureau chief, for today's introduction. No one saw it coming. When Gov Jerry Brown on Thursday appointed Xavier Becerra, the Democratic congressman from Los Angeles, to fill the     position of California attorney general, the move roiled the state's political establishment. (Much of the speculation had centered around the possibility that Mr. Brown would choose his wife and close adviser, Anne Gust Brown, to replace Kamala Harris, the attorney general who was just elected to the USA Senate.) Mr. Brown likes to surprise. And after the drubbing Democrats took in Washington this year  —   and the defeat of Clinton, who Mr. Becerra campaigned for so intensely that he even entertained the idea she might pick him as his running mate  —   it's hardly a shock that Mr. Becerra is eager to return to California. “Most insiders believed he wanted to move back to California, so all in all it was a pretty elegant political play,” said Peter Ragone, a political consultant in San Francisco who is advising Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor who is running for governor in 2018. But the appointment shakes up a Democratic political world that had already been girding for fundamental changes as its three most senior elected officials, all of whom are over 70  —   Mr. Brown, Senator Barbara Boxer and Senator Dianne Feinstein  —   prepare to exit from the scene. Mr. Becerra joins a very crowded list of Democrats angling for some of those jobs. And now he has the advantage of a perch, the office of attorney general, that historically has afforded its occupant a lot of exposure. Mr. Becerra, 58, will now be one of the   Latino officials in the state at a time when California is gearing up for clashes with   Donald J. Trump on immigration. He could run for attorney general again and make a career out of that. But he now has a platform that will allow him to run for governor, or for that matter senator. But not too soon. “I don't think it's viable to get appointed and then quit immediately to run for something else, but he will run for something else down the road,” Mr. Ragone said. • Joe McKnight, 28, who was a standout football player at U.

There's an app for that. Over the summer, the city introduced “Get it Done San Diego,” an app and companion website that allows residents to report problems along the streets and sidewalks using their smartphones. After six months of operation, we checked in with city officials to see how it's going. Almis Udrys, San Diego's director of performance and analytics, said the app had been downloaded roughly 9, 500 times and was used to send more than 38, 500 reports to the city. About half of those reports have been resolved, either fixed or determined to be a nonissue, he said. The rest were referred to other agencies, like a utility company, or remain open. The most common complaint? Graffiti, followed by potholes and broken streetlights. According to Mr. Udrys, the fix time has averaged around 10 days, but longer in the case of a big repair like a bent traffic light pole. There are still kinks to work out. Some app users have expressed frustration after reporting problems that fall under the responsibility of other agencies  —   for example, a bridge managed by Caltrans. The city refers those reports to the agencies, but whether they get addressed is anyone's guess, some users said. What's more, for residents uninterested in downloading yet another app, San Diego does not offer the convenient 311 phone reporting system used in other cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles. Mr. Udrys said San Diego hoped to introduce one in the “next few years. ” Reviews of the “Get it Done” app in the iPhone store and Android website, as well as in a recent discussion on Reddit, the online forum, have been generally positive. Karl Decker, 38, said he used the app to report a curb that needed a fresh coat of red paint outside his house.

5071,22918,Fight - The NY Times,NY Times,Dan Barry,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"PART 1 YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio  —   Numbered balls of chance rattle and rise two nights a week down at the cavernous community hall of Sts. Peter and Paul Ukrainian Orthodox Church. It's called a good bingo when your number comes up. But that last Saturday before Christmas offered no good bingos. The night was reserved for a boxing event billed as Season's Beatings, which had prompted a newspaper deliveryman named Anthony Taylor to pull up in his clattering Dodge Caravan.   years old, 5 feet tall, 115 pounds, about to turn pro. A fist of nerves, he walked down the   stairwell to the finished basement, a space used for church dances and wedding banquets, but now an open locker room. Chandeliers glittered above the fighters trying to warm up and calm down, while the crowds upstairs cheered on the amateurs, including a      who would knock out his   opponent. Taylor had longed for this moment. All those years of being picked on because of his size, all those street fights, all that anger needing redirection toward something constructive  —   all down to this. He had his hair in ropy dreadlocks and his   shorts,   for $300, pulled high on his hardened torso. Portable curtains in the basement separated the hometown favorites from the    the A's from the B's. Someone smart about boxing could walk in cold and tell which side was which. The local fighters are usually a notch above, in better shape, expected to win. But Taylor's   trainer, Jack Loew, heard this hammering sound, a whap, whap,   from the curtain's other side. He peeked and saw a sinewy teenager in    shorts pounding the outstretched mitts of his trainer with uncommon discipline.  . “We got a fighter,” Loew said to somebody. Taylor was on his own side of the divide, warming up, when the curtain briefly parted to reveal his opponent. They made eye contact. “Nothing like anger,” Taylor recalled. “Both nervous. Just looking at each other. ” The curtain closed. A Life of Taking Punches and Unleashing His Own “Five foot even. ” That's how Anthony Taylor describes his height. Not a   higher or lower. Five foot even. When you're 9 inches shorter than the average man, abuse will find you. But Taylor was determined from an early age to prove his true stature the only way he knew. “Street fighting,” he says. His mother, an   factory worker, and his father, a handyman, split up before he was in kindergarten, so he bounced around a little. Moving from the small Ohio city of Warren to Youngstown, then down to Jackson, Tenn. he learned that broken families were tough on children, and that bullies were ubiquitous. “I was always the smallest guy in the neighborhood, so I had a lot of people picking on me,” Taylor said. “I really didn't go around looking for trouble. It just seemed to find me because I was so small. ” “And I had a bad attitude,” he added. One day the manager of a gym in Jackson saw this small angry kid giving as good as he got, and invited him to do something with those quick hands and quicker rage. The kid began to learn. “Somebody hit you, hit you really hard, and you want to do something back,” Taylor said. “But when you think about it, you can't fight when you're angry. Boxing is a thinking game. ” Taylor followed the amateur circuit  —   Florida, Alabama, Arkansas, Nevada  —   earning a reputation as a boxer who kept on coming. At a fight one night in Little Rock, his trainer called out, “Go get him, Tiger. ” The nickname stuck. He tried a semester of community college, but higher education wasn't for him, at least not yet. Sometimes the classes would run over time, and he'd be late to the gym. College could wait, he figured boxing could not. He had his career goals. “To be at the top of the ladder,” he said. “Number one. Champion. ” Missing his family back north, Taylor returned to Ohio. He lives with his fiancée, Tiera Glover, their    daughter and her two sons in Warren, in a worn house with green plastic furniture planted under the porch's sagging roof. They cover the $600 monthly rent by delivering 250 copies of The Tribune Chronicle, a Warren newspaper, every morning. And every afternoon, except on days when he can't afford the gas, Taylor drives his knocking Dodge Caravan, with its car seat and little girl toys, the 20 miles to Youngstown  —   to Jack Loew's South Side Boxing Club, his   sanctuary, where boxing gloves hang from nails like holiday ornaments. The club stands out along a   stretch of Market Street. Some years ago, its owner, Jack Loew, hired a resident of a nearby halfway house for convicts to paint the exterior red and black. The artist also painted a pair of boxing gloves, enveloped in a wreath of stars that can convey dreamlike glory or a concussive haze. Loew is 56,   and as squat and solid as his building. He boxed as an amateur before focusing on a college football career that ended after several knee operations. He became a Teamster, lost the warehouse job he thought would last to retirement, worked construction and started his own   company. He also opened this club in 1989, as if in homage to what his hometown had once been. Youngstown was a pugnacious steel city of 167, 000 when Loew was born, with boxing clubs anchored in many neighborhoods. This is where his childhood friend Ray Mancini  —   Boom Boom  —   learned how to become a world lightweight champion. A   later, Youngstown is down to a population of 65, 000, a hemorrhaging of 100, 000 people caused by   closings, a failure to diversify and the absence, so far, of a sustainable second act. Lost in the exodus were some signature parts of the Youngstown culture, including many boxing clubs. But Loew took a shot. He opened his gym on Southern Boulevard, moved to an ancient brick building on Erie Street, then settled here, on the city's tough south side. No problems so far, save for that time someone removed a massive tractor tire from the gym and rolled it like a determined Sisyphus up and down the hilly neighborhood  —   only to return the tire the next day. His excuse was simple: Just wanted to see if I could do it, Coach. Two decades ago, a scrappy    kid from the south side's Slovak neighborhood came to Loew's gym looking to learn how to box. This kid, Kelly Pavlik, went on to become the Ghost, an electrifying, dominant boxer with a drinking problem. He abruptly quit in 2013, saying he feared the   medical impact of his chosen career. “Kelly picked my door to come through,” said Loew, who is called Coach Jack by his boxers. “We were always crowded, but when we won middleweight champion of the world.   …    ” No need to finish the sentence: Pavlik's success was good for Jack Loew's South Side Boxing Club. It attracted a lot of locals looking to make their mark, including a superflyweight named Anthony Taylor. “A   Joe Frazier,” Loew said. This is boxing code for saying that Taylor keeps coming at you, takes a punch to give a punch, and has fists that hit like anvils. Taylor couldn't remain an amateur forever. Loew needed to find him a professional opponent, maybe for the Season's Beatings event that he had set up for the week before Christmas at the Ukrainian hall. But flyweights and bantamweights  —   who weigh less than half the reigning heavyweight champion, Tyson Fury  —   are hard to come by in this part of the country. A couple of weeks before Christmas, though, a trainer from Detroit who was bringing in two amateurs for the boxing night offered a solution. He said that he could supply a flyweight who, like Taylor, was itching to turn pro. Two Partners Engaging in a Dangerous Dance The ding of a bell in a church hall transformed two slight young men into professional fighters, hired to withstand blows to body and head while trying to pound each other out of consciousness. Their pay for the   fight: $300 for Taylor and $500 for his    opponent, since he was coming in from 200 miles away. Moments earlier they had stood with heads bowed, their coaches massaging their backs as the referee went over final details. Then they had tapped gloves, a gesture conveying   solidarity between strangers, known to each other only through a stolen glance across that parted curtain. Anthony Taylor danced the cautionary dance with his partner, head bobbing, looking for a moment to strike. He prided himself on his patience. But when the opponent tested with a tentative, catlike thrust, Taylor responded with a wild swing that punched only air, betraying his overeagerness. Then came a   scrum, left right left right. Violent contact made. The crowd aahed in approval. More than 700 people had turned out. Loew, the promoter as well as Taylor's trainer, had charged $20 for general admission and $50 for ringside, while also managing to sell more than two dozen corporate tables. But after covering expenses that included the referee, the hall and ring rentals, and the hotel rooms for    boxers, Loew would take in just $382 for his eight weeks of work. At least his choice of location and timing  —   a Ukrainian church hall in late December  —   ensured a festive touch to the boxing event. A decorated Christmas tree sparkled in the corner. A    Ukrainian flag hung over the water fountain. A Christmas wreath and bright lights hung beside signs that said, “Valid Bingo Is Ball Called  —   Not Off Monitor” and “Early Bird Winner Take All. ” Instead of calls of “ ” and “” though, there arose the grunts of boxers, the whacks of leather against flesh, the cries and sighs of spectators in thrall. Some of the loudest shouts came from Taylor's friends and family members. “Come on, Ant'! You got this!” Taylor crouched as he stalked, making his   frame even smaller before springing like a    . He connected with a left that sent his opponent back, and kept on coming. He ducked under a swing, came over the top and delivered another left that knocked the fighter in red and white down into the ropes. As Taylor retreated to his corner, fans were shouting: “He's done, he's done! Stop the fight!” Seconds later, Taylor struck again. “His guard came down, and I hit him with a straight left hand,” he recalled. A second knockdown, although this time his opponent got up quickly, adjusting his trunks as if the fall had been nothing more than a wardrobe malfunction. Then Taylor found himself reeling backward, almost comically, after taking a hard left to the head. He responded with a punch that he thought connected for a delayed knockdown others saw more of a phantom punch and stumble. Still, Loew recalled, “If the ref had stopped the fight, I don't think anyone would have complained. ” The bell clanged. Taylor slumped to his corner, exhausted from all that he had expended trying to end the fight. He drank some water and listened to encouraging words from Loew, who struggled to be heard over the    music pounding out of the sound system. Then, again, came the bell's beckoning. Taylor found his opponent waiting for him at the center of the ring, as if awakened by the knockdowns of the previous round. Soon there came a left that bounced Taylor off the ring's    ropes. “Anthony!” someone pleaded. But Taylor could not yet find the wind or strength. “I threw out a lot of gas in the first round by me trying to finish him off,” he said later. “You're trying to hurry up and get done with the fight. And that's where the turnaround was in the second round. ” “Knock him out,” someone in Taylor's corner shouted. Then: “Get him! Get him!” And: “Let's go, Tiger!” And: “Put him down, Ant'!” Taylor took quick rights to the jaw, another hard right that rocked him, then a left and a right. Gloved fists pounded his many tattoos: the “R. I. P. ” on his right shoulder that honors a brother shot to death (“Wrong place, wrong time,” he says) the    on his left shoulder that reminds him he's a jewel in the rough the dice and playing cards adorning his chest, along with the inscription: “Life A Gamble. ” Tension and Triumph, Confusion and Dread The bell. Another squirt of water. More of Coach Jack's encouragement, only now sounding urgent. The passing blur of a young woman holding aloft a placard announcing Round 3. The bell. And there was Taylor's opponent again, at the center of the ring, waiting. Taylor connected with a roundhouse left, but his opponent returned with a   insult to the chin. Taylor seemed   almost disengaged, as if exhaustion had displaced his purpose. “Let's go, little man!” someone called out. But Taylor's coach was more concrete. “Breathe, breathe!” Loew was shouting. “You gotta push it, Anthony!” Taylor did revive, holding his own until the bell. He was convinced the round was a tossup, but his coach knew otherwise. “Anthony was gassed in the third round, and took an ” Loew said. Now it was the fourth and last round, the final three minutes, and there again was his opponent, waiting. Taylor knew this was it  —   “an    thing,” he called it. His dreadlocks swayed as he danced and dodged, as he punched and received punches. It went this way, a study in mundane violence, for most of the first two minutes. Toe to toe. But then Taylor suddenly had his opponent near the ropes. He threw a right that either glanced off the boxer or missed him entirely. The opponent fell backward to all but sit on the apron. Trying to capitalize, Taylor threw a left. But the opponent ducked to his right and stumbled forward, head sweeping briefly against Taylor's chest, arms outstretched, looking for something to hold on to, as if the blue mat had been pulled from beneath him. He looped his left arm around Taylor's torso as he fell onto his right knee, his lower body gone limp, his black gloves down in sudden vulnerability. The referee waved his arms. Fight over! He bent down to help the opponent, who reached up with his right hand. Halfway to his feet, the boxer wobbled and fell back down. The sudden uncertainty disrupted the order in the ring. The opponent's coach had slipped through the ropes and was now trying to help his fighter, who struggled again to rise, only to sway and fall back against his coach's shins. My knee, he was saying. My knee. Loew was also in the ring, yelling to Bernie Profato, the director of the Ohio Athletic Commission, sitting at ringside, that the round hadn't ended, and you can't have people coming into the ring, and that was a knockdown.   …     “Your kid's gotta hit him for a knockdown,” Profato called back. Mere noise. The fight was over. The opponent lay on his back as some people hovered over him, including the ringside doctor  —   a dermatologist  —   now slipping on a pair of surgical gloves. Taylor, meanwhile, knew only that he had won. He raised an arm and took a few courtly bows. But a shadow of dread was settling over this decorated bingo hall masquerading as a boxing arena. A fallen man was not rising, not rising, still not rising. His eyes were closed. Medics were climbing into the ring. “You knew,” Loew said. “You knew right then and there. ” You knew right then and there. The loser, this kid from Michigan named Hamzah Aljahmi, now   was unconscious. And the winner, Anthony Taylor, now   was sobbing. PART 2 DEARBORN, Mich.  —   The amateur boxer slept. Huddled in the passenger seat of his family's sport utility vehicle, he rocked in slumber as his father drove out of Dearborn, then south and east around Lake Erie, verses from the Quran intoning softly from the speakers. Now and then the boxer would rouse long enough for a snatch of small talk. But soon his eyes would close again, and he would sleep through the December blur of Rust Belt towns and   fields, right to the edge of the Ohio city where he was to fight his first professional fight. Youngstown. This was Hamzah Aljahmi, 19, the oldest child and best friend of the man behind the wheel, Ali Aljahmi. The   permit dangling from the rearview mirror hinted of the father's   worries, but no matter how bad things got, he knew that he could always confide in this beautiful   beside him, sleeping now to the   rhythms. How could he deny his son's passionate dream to box his way to fame and fortune? To become the pride of Dearborn? Of Yemeni people everywhere? This was Hamzah's destiny: to make his professional debut at a Christmastime boxing event called Season's Beatings. Hamzah's father had followed a different path. Born in Yemen, he had immigrated to Brooklyn, left high school without graduating  —   joked around too much, he says  —   and begun a life of manual labor. Store work. Factory work. Lifting and moving. He gravitated to Dearborn, the world headquarters of the Ford Motor Company, where   of the nearly 100, 000 residents are  : Lebanese, Syrian, Iraqi, Palestinian, Yemeni. Here are the Henry Ford museum and the Arab American National Museum, plants that make the   truck and restaurants that make fahsa, a seasoned lamb stew that is shared with others and scooped with torn pieces of flatbread. Now Ali Aljahmi was the married father of five, disabled by a   injury and living in a   neighborhood, a block from a massive factory. But he was an Aljahmi, a member of a fiercely proud extended Yemeni family with deep roots in two cultures. The Aljahmis, the Eljahmis, the Algahmis, the Aljahims  —   all there for him, and he for them. Above all, he was there for Hamzah, his elder son, the boxer. Years earlier, when the family was living in Detroit, three kids ganged up on skinny young Hamzah Aljahmi. The boy held his own in the mismatch, prompting an onlooker to give grudging respect: Your son is one tough character. Sensing a purpose in life, Hamzah began training with one of his idols, Brian Mihtar, a prominent   middleweight boxer known as Brian the Lion, who compiled a   record, with 10 knockouts, before suspending his career in 2010. He took a liking to this fledgling boxer, who showed both talent and heart. “Like a brother,” Mihtar said. When Mihtar closed his gym, Aljahmi and his father searched the Detroit area for someone who could make the boy   someday. They eventually chose Mohamed Hamood, or Coach Mo, a muscular former Marine with a shaved head who builds houses to support his family and his boxing fix. The amateur's determination and focus impressed Hamood. The boy had phenomenal hand speed, an ability to slip punches, and surprising pop for a flyweight. But his tendency to fight with his chin up often left him dangerously exposed it was almost as if he were daring to be hit. Still, Hamood said, “a very hard worker  —   very hard. ” Hamzah Aljahmi fought more than a score of amateur matches, winning most and learning from all. Turning pro became his obsession, his father said: “All the time, his mind go to the boxing. ” He admired the ferocious boxers of Yemeni blood. Sadam Ali, the tough welterweight from Brooklyn. Mohamed Adam, the young superfeatherweight from Dearborn. His former coach, the Lion, Brian Mihtar. And, of course, Prince Naseem, whose image even served for a while as the wallpaper on Aljahmi's smartphone. True, the young man had other interests. He attended prayer services. Doted on his mother and younger siblings. Abided high school, barely. Kept girls at a safe but friendly distance. Worked at a Tim Horton's doughnut shop and then at the American Coney Island restaurant, serving hot dogs smothered in chili and onions. But it was boxing that defined him. He craved cranberry juice, shunned bread and spent most of his spare time in Hamood's gym, in Dearborn Heights, working out, sparring with heavier partners, itching to fight for a living. “He was bugging me to go pro when he was 17,” Hamood, 55, recalled. “And I'd say, ‘Let's take our time.' ” Some friends and relatives approached the inherent violence of Aljahmi's passion delicately, occasionally suggesting that he give up the ring. Others accepted that he knew who he was, and admired him for it. He talked of becoming champion and parlaying his   fame in a way that would help others in need  —   in   Yemen and beyond. Remember when he helped to collect clothes for Syrian refugees? And somehow persuaded his father to donate his three favorite coats? Remember that saying he used to repeat? “You laugh at me because I'm different I laugh at you because you're all the same. ” Mohammad Yacoubi, 19, a classmate of Aljahmi's and one of his closest friends, shrugged in mock surrender while trying to explain the young man's charms. He had no enemies, he was respectful to his mother and father, he loved his siblings, and he was loyal to his friends. “Just a special kid,” Yacoubi said. Opportunity came in early December, when Coach Mo Hamood struck a deal to have Aljahmi fight in Youngstown against another amateur who was also turning pro. “He was ready,” Hamood said of his young flyweight. Aljahmi girded for the day. After telling his father that a door had opened, he posted a photograph on Instagram of his application for a Michigan boxing license, along with a note sharing the date of his debut fight  —   “DECEMBER 19th”  —   and asking people to come support him. “Alhamdulillah. ” Praise be to God. Making Final Preparations and Planning to Celebrate As the S. U. V. approached the outskirts of Youngstown, some three hours after leaving Dearborn, Hamzah Aljahmi stirred into consciousness. Looking around, he said that it was his turn to drive. His father laughed but surrendered the wheel. Father and son headed to the prefight   at a government building in downtown Youngstown. The younger Aljahmi's     manner impressed the director of the Ohio Athletic Commission, a retired police officer and former referee named Bernie Profato  —   so much so that Profato told him, win or lose, “You'll be welcome back in Ohio anytime. ” After the   Aljahmi joined his coach and the two amateurs from Dearborn, including an    with a preternatural punching ability, for some   at a Carrabba's Italian restaurant, not far from their rooms at the Red Roof Inn. Aljahmi had pasta with cream sauce. Before the night was over, the eager boxer posted one last photograph of himself on Instagram. Big smile. Throwing a right fist at the camera. “Ready for 2mrw fight night everyone keep me in ur prayers inshallah,” he wrote. If Allah wills it. The next morning, Aljahmi and his father ate breakfast at an IHOP  —   eggs and turkey sausage for more weight gain  —   then returned to the hotel for a short rest and the long wait. Since the next day would be the father's 51st birthday, the two Aljahmis talked about getting a cake. “Win and we'll celebrate twice,” the father promised. With the time drawing near, they drove with Coach Mo and his two young amateurs to the    community hall of Sts. Peter and Paul Ukrainian Orthodox Church, on Youngstown's west side. Joining them were four friends who had driven from Dearborn in a cramped   Toyota. Down in the hall's chandeliered basement, where curtains separated boxers from the opponents they were about to meet, young Aljahmi chatted away as his coach prepared him for his debut. While Aljahmi sat with his arms propped on a white towel draped over a chair back, Coach Mo wrapped his boxer's hands in protective gauze, carefully, almost clinically. He then slipped   gloves over those hands and tied the strings. Finally, to cut down on the rudeness of leather against skin, he applied petroleum jelly with his fingertips to the unlined brow, the fresh cheeks, and the chin too often left exposed in the rashness of youth. There was one last detail. With his first professional fight just moments away, Aljahmi still had no nickname. But if his opponent  —   a short fighter he had seen when the curtain between them suddenly opened  —   was calling himself the Tiger, then how about something just as feral? How about the Lion? Agreed. A protective entourage  —   his father, his coach, a few friends  —   escorted Aljahmi up the basement steps and into the   auditorium, a   bingo hall set up for a boxing event. Now here he was, for the night's first professional fight, a   in the superflyweight division. In    shorts with matching red shoes, the dynamo from Dearborn. The pride of the   community. His father's best friend. Hamzah “the Lion” Aljahmi. A Sudden Shift in Mood After the Opening Bell Before the first bell, Aljahmi had told Coach Mo that this was his time. I'm ready, Coach, he had said. Let's get this thing going. Now it was going, but not well. Aljahmi's opponent was quick, active, and crouched so small that he made for a difficult target. The sight of their Hamzah being pummeled startled his friends, who had been harboring a more abstract understanding of what it meant to box professionally. Then down Aljahmi went, tagged by a powerful left. His opponent had capitalized on the weakness that Coach Mo had been working on: the “boxing ” he called it, of leaving the chin exposed. “It felt like a movie when he went down,” Aljahmi's friend Mohammad Yacoubi said. “He had gone into that ring like a superhero. ” A few seconds later, Aljahmi went down a second time, forcing Coach Mo to make quick assessments. His young boxer was more “wobbly” after the first knockdown, the coach later said, after taking a punch that was “right on the button. ” But the second one? “He had a little wobble,” he said. “But he can go. ” Aljahmi did bounce up quickly. He adjusted his trunks  —   as if recalibrating body and mind  —   and went back to work. Becoming more aggressive, he delivered a hard left that had his opponent backpedaling. Then, while trying to avoid a swing that seemed to hit more air than flesh, Aljahmi fell against the ropes. He might have simply tripped, but it was not an impressive way to end the first round. Two knockdowns and one stumble. He returned to his corner charged with energy. What did I do wrong, Coach? “Hamzah, your chin is way up in the air,” Hamood recalled saying. “And your right hand is down. ” Aljahmi went out to own the second round, exploiting his opponent's fatigue and blocking out the shouts of a Youngstown crowd eager to see this    fall. When the bell rang, he all but ran back to his corner after leaving his weary opponent on the ropes. “Great job,” Coach Mo told Aljahmi. “Let's keep doing what you're doing. Use your jab. No need to wrestle with him. ” Aljahmi looked at his clutch of friends in the seats, smiled, nodded his head  —   and returned to the ring to follow his coach's instructions exactly. Round 3 repeated Round 2. Although his opponent tagged him quickly with a left from nowhere, Aljahmi answered with a hard right to the chin. “There he goes!” Yacoubi, Aljahmi's friend, shouted. Soon another Aljahmi right found purchase. “There you go! There you go! He's tired! He's tired! Hamzah, he's tired!” This was true. Aljahmi's opponent was still recovering from having fought so aggressively in the first round. His own coach was shouting for him to push through it  —   which he did, briefly, during a   flurry. The bell rang just as Aljahmi uncorked one more punch. A little late, it seemed, but clearly accidental. He tapped his opponent's chest in apology. Coach Mo gave Aljahmi water and applied more petroleum jelly, that translucent touch of protection, to his eyebrows, cheeks and nose. “We need this round,” the coach said, as if to make clear to his boxer the tossup closeness of the fight. I got you, Coach. Aljahmi then leaned over, found his father in the crowd, and shook his right glove in a gesture that seemed to say now is the time. Now. He was so jacked up on adrenaline that he hurried to the center of the ring well before the bell. The   referee had to nudge him back a step or two, while his coach called after him that he was the toughest kid he knew. “Go get him,” Coach Mo commanded. The two superflyweights gave it their all, each determined not to lose his professional debut, as the crowd urged them on. “Give him one, Hamzah!” Aljahmi's friends shouted. “There you go! More! More!” “Get him, get him, get him!” “Hamzah, get him! Hamzah, he's done! He's done!” “Keep going!” Then  —   a punch to their friend's head. “Oooh!” Aljahmi, who had been dominating, was suddenly backed into a corner by his flailing opponent. “Get out of the corner!” a friend yelled. “Get out of the corner!” Too late. Their superhero was squat against the apron, dodging swings, lurching forward, grasping to hold on to something unseen, then falling, drooping, legs not cooperating, arms down. The referee stopped the fight, causing confusion about what had just happened. He tried to help Aljahmi to his feet, but the boxer could not find the strength. Panicking, Coach Mo rushed into the ring. “Good job, Hamzah!” he said, mistakenly thinking the bell had rung. “Get up. You won the fight!” I can't. My knee. I twisted my knee. He leaned back, or maybe fell back, onto Coach Mo's shins. Aljahmi's father and friends had just been shouting that his opponent was “done” now they were mute. A moment ago their Hamzah had been controlling the fight now he was propped against his coach's legs like a rag doll. A dermatologist serving as the ringside doctor slipped under the ropes and donned surgical gloves. The Lion lay flat on the mat. Then, Coach Mo said, “Hamzah closed his eyes. ” PART 3 YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio  —   The fearless young boxer feared what he would see, feared how he would be received. He lingered at the threshold of the surgical intensive care unit, unable to take those few short steps to the bedside of his comatose opponent. The boxer, Anthony Taylor, known for his        ferocity, froze under the unforgiving lights of crisis care at St. Elizabeth Youngstown Hospital, where a chorus of beeping monitors and exhaling respirators sang of lives at the precipice. He did not want to be here. That is, he wanted to be here, and his coach told him that he should be here, but he was frightened. In his gloveless hands he carried the shield of a bouquet, bright yellow flowers that were like dandelions, only nicer. A nurse asked if he needed help. Soon, a relative of the patient he had come to see invited him into a crowded room. There, in a small bed, with a white bandage wrapped around his head and a blue air tube running from his mouth, was the man Taylor had recently danced and fought with: Hamzah Aljahmi, 19, his eyes still closed. Taylor handed the flowers to someone and sat in a chair near the foot of the bed, stunned. To think that less than 72 hours earlier, he and this person had each been paid a few hundred dollars to fight their first professional fight, a   in the hall of a Ukrainian church. To think how they had stared into each other's eyes while engaged in a most violent form of intimacy. It could be    Anthony Taylor in that bed, not Hamzah Aljahmi. Now Anthony would be spending the holidays with his family, while Hamzah.   …     The visitor began to cry. Ali Aljahmi, a first cousin, was moved, even impressed, by the sight of this distraught stranger paying his respects. For you to step into this room of anger and grief, Aljahmi thought to himself. For you to come to be with us. Takes a lot of strength. The cousin led Taylor into the hall to offer comforting perspective. Whatever was happening in that hospital room was Allah's will, he said, and do not doubt that you helped Hamzah to realize his dream of becoming a professional boxer. One more thing, Aljahmi said. “You have become family with me forever for this kind of gesture. ” Taylor returned to the room and, for the next hour, talked with the father, an uncle and a few cousins of the man laid out before them, the black of his eyebrows enhanced by an enveloping whiteness of bandages and blankets. “They told me they wanted me to keep going,” Taylor recalled. “That he would want me to keep going, and that I have to honor him and keep him alive by continuing to box. ” The father, also named Ali Aljahmi, would only vaguely remember Taylor's visit, so   were his waves of grief. He had been at the fight. He had seen his beloved son, a determined fighter, crumple to the blue mat. Not in direct response to any punch, it seemed, but almost as an afterthought. The elder Aljahmi had been here in this chilling, antiseptic environment ever since, save for when nurses would gently tell him it was time to leave for the night. He'd return to a hotel whose name he would not remember and try to avoid the many anxious telephone calls from family members and friends back in their hometown of Dearborn. How is Hamzah? How is Hamzah? How is Hamzah? The father did not want to answer. If he did respond, it was to tell a version of the truth: “Hamzah is sleeping. ” Finally, the father telephoned a nephew in Dearborn with the same name as his: Ali Aljahmi, Hamzah's cousin. I need you to bring Hamzah's mother here to Youngstown, Ali. She needs to see him. The nephew understood what his uncle was not saying. He did as he was told. He packed Hamzah's mother, Jamilah Aljahmi, and other relatives into a borrowed Chevy Cruze and began to drive, listening to them cry because Hamzah had been injured, but knowing that worse news awaited them in Youngstown. The mother saw her child wrapped in white, as if already prepared for the coffin. She held his feet, felt warmth, and in her profound grief exclaimed that he was alive! All this was too much for her health, it was decided. A relative drove Hamzah's mother and the other women back to Dearborn. To wait for what was to be. But the father clung to hope as his son had clung to the ropes. He arose one morning in that strange hotel feeling as though all would be well. These efficient people in lab coats and nursing outfits would find some   equivalent of smelling salts, and his son's eyes would open. Finally, though, the father let go. Shedding his stoicism, he collapsed onto his son's chest and begged between sobs that Hamzah rise and come with him to IHOP for another restorative meal. Please, Hamzah, he implored. Do not leave your best friend like this. The shaken cousin, Ali Aljahmi, sought out the neurosurgeon and asked to be told straight, so that the family could prepare. “He said in 30 years he hadn't seen a brain so damaged,” he remembered. “He told me  : Start making arrangements. ” By this point, Anthony Taylor the boxer had said his hospital goodbyes and driven his dented Dodge Caravan the 20 miles back to the weathered white house he rented with his fiancée. Exhausted by it all, he fell asleep, only to awake an hour later to a text message aglow on his phone. Hamzah Aljahmi was dead. A Tribute to a Man Who ‘Was Everything' After the autopsy, a Youngstown funeral home arranged to return Hamzah Aljahmi to Michigan, retracing his interstate journey past the deadened brown of a Rust Belt December, to a funeral home in Detroit, close to the Dearborn line. A handful of relatives and friends, all men, prepared the young body for burial. They prayed as they tended to their somber task, while verses of the Quran emanated from a loudspeaker. The dead young man was laid upon a table. Fingernails and toenails were clipped. The body was meticulously cleansed and gently rubbed with a scented oil that made the skin glisten  —   “The smell was very beautiful,” the cousin Ali Aljahmi said. Then it was wrapped in three sheets of white cloth. The boxer was placed in a   coffin made of fiberboard and cardboard, in keeping with an adherence to simplicity. A pleasant perfume was sprinkled over the burial cloth. Late the next morning, a dark blue Dodge Caravan hearse carried the body the seven miles to the American Moslem Society mosque, a   building topped with a turquoise dome. Hundreds were already gathering in the parking lot. Family members shelved their shoes and carried the modest coffin up the stairs, past the small brown donation boxes and into a   area reserved for women, at the far back of the cavernous hall. The sounds of weeping escaped the divide. The coffin, draped in a    cloth, was then moved to one side of the long rectangular hall, where mourners paid their respects to many, many relatives: the extended Aljahmi tribe. The father, Ali Aljahmi, sat in the first chair, and in the second, at the family's insistence, was Mohamed Hamood  —   Coach Mo  —   Hamzah's   trainer. The mourning paused for the afternoon prayer. Long rows of men and boys, including many not before seen at the mosque, stood shoulder to shoulder on the    carpet with patterns pointing toward Mecca. They spilled into the downstairs space and out into the parking lot. After the afternoon prayer, relatives carried the coffin to the front of the room. The imam led a short funeral service that included prayers for forgiveness, for Hamzah Aljahmi, for all of humankind, and for mercy upon the family. Allahu akbar. God is great. It was time for burial. The shoeless pallbearers descended the stairs to meet the December cold and the jostle of thousands. They walked with purpose across the lot, some slipping into shoes as they went, carving a path through a human crush that was affecting traffic along Vernor Highway. Many vied to touch the coffin, while others competed for an honored turn as a pallbearer. But why so many mourners for a    man? People explain that Hamzah Aljahmi “died in action” that he represented the Yemeni embrace of boxing that he made friends with Arabs and   black, white, male, female that he embodied an infectious liveliness. “He was everything, to be honest with you,” Ibrahim Aljahim, a cousin and community leader, said. Another cousin, Fayez Algahmi, a former honorary consul of Yemen, agreed. “The way he died, and the thing he died for, touched everyone,” Algahmi said. The funeral procession turned right onto Riverside Drive, along which the rusty   fence of Woodmere Cemetery disappears into the distance. Now and then the undulations in the cemetery's brown grass revealed the   tops of tombstones. Chanting prayers as they walked, the mourners turned left at a gate to enter the cemetery, many of them forming a protective bubble around the raised coffin. The occasional cold breeze ruffled its drape of    cloth. Near the grave site, relatives opened the coffin one more time, so that the father and a few others could say their final goodbyes. “I gave him a bunch of kisses on the forehead,” his first cousin Ali Aljahmi recalled. In keeping with Islamic ritual, the body was turned on its right side to face Mecca, and some dirt was placed beside it. The coffin was closed, and lowered into its concrete rectangular case. Then mourner after mourner threw dirt three times into the hole, signifying the beginning and end of things. God is great, they whispered. To God we belong, and to him we shall return. The communal grieving did not end at the grave. For weeks afterward, streams of people came to the Aljahmi family's simple home to offer condolences and distraction. Among them were many young people seeking some token or relic of their friend the boxer, Hamzah the Lion. A  . A jacket. A shoe. A ribbon. A trophy. Of course, of course, the brokenhearted father would say. “I don't close the door,” he explained. A Fighter Finds Comfort in Someone Who Understands On the tough south side of Youngstown, in the squat   refuge called Jack Loew's South Side Boxing Club, the boxing life continues for Anthony Taylor. He and other   champions punch bags and skip rope, spar with partners and obey the sign that says “no weapon of any kind”  —   other than fists. Taylor had taken some time off after the Hamzah Aljahmi fight to get his body and mind straight. His right hand had been damaged, among other parts. True, the first time Taylor returned to the ring to spar, he froze for a moment. (“I was waiting on him, and he hit me, and hit me again,” he says. “And I was like, O. K. ”) But now the Tiger is back, shorn of his dreadlocks and preparing for his second professional fight, which is scheduled to be at the same venue, Sts. Peter and Paul Ukrainian Orthodox Church. He'll be taking his chances, once again, in a bingo hall. “I can't walk in there thinking about what happened,” Taylor says, as if trying to convince himself. “You can't change what's happened in the past. I wish I could. ” As Taylor works out, his coach, Jack Loew, sits in his back office, the walls covered with boxing memorabilia, a broken speed bag on his desk. He was the promoter behind that fatal boxing event, and he has wept over Aljahmi's death. “You don't think about stuff like that,” Loew says, voice cracking. “A frigging club show with   for four rounds. ” A few loose ends from that night remain to be tied. For one thing, the Mahoning County coroner has yet to release the results of his autopsy (although the weakness in Aljahmi's right leg that night could be suggestive of a left hemispheric brain bleed). This is why Bernie Profato, the Ohio Athletic Commission's director, has not formally closed the case, although he says his own inquiry found no lapses of protocol by the commission he oversees. Profato is also haunted by the memory of this polite young man, such a model of respect at the  . But the inherent dangers are made plain in the contracts signed by boxers, including these two   pros, Taylor and Aljahmi. “You're entering a sport where you could be seriously hurt or injured,” Profato says. “They know that. That's just the nature of the sport. ” A childhood friend of Loew's comes through the boxing club's door: Ray Mancini, the onetime lightweight world champion, known in Youngstown and far beyond as Boom Boom. Unfairly, he is also known for one fight:   Kim, Las Vegas, 1982. Mancini connected with two hard rights to Kim's head at the start of the 14th round, sending the tenacious South Korean challenger to the canvas and prompting the referee to declare a technical knockout. Incurring a brain bleed known as a subdural hematoma, Kim lapsed into a coma and died four days later. He was 27. Mancini was 21. It took years, but Mancini worked his way through the depression and   that followed. Even though he eventually forgave himself and made peace with the tragedy, he says, others have shown less grace over the years. “Hey, Boom Boom,” he mimics. “Hey, man, let me ask you something. What's it like to kill somebody in the ring? I mean, what's it like to see someone go down and never get up?” Mancini is 54 now,   and fit, with various business and entertainment interests. He has come to his friend's club this evening to counsel the young boxer with whom he shares a sorrowful bond. He wants to talk about forgiveness, and loudmouths, and giving up the game if there is even the slightest hesitation in the ring. Loew heads for the door in search of his boxer Taylor, saying, “I don't even know where this kid is at. ” Soon Anthony Taylor, fresh from the stutter of speed bags and the whack of skipped rope, is in the   quiet, sitting shyly across from the Boom Boom Mancini like a confessor before a priest. “Really sad for you, man,” Mancini begins. “I never met you before, but.   …    ”"
5399,23315,"‘It's Sacred': A Gay Refuge, Turned Into a War Zone - The NY Times",NY Times,Michael Barbaro,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"I remember my therapist's advice when I was a    not yet     gay man living in Washington  —   uncertain, unhappy, unready. She knew that I wasn't prepared to walk into a gay club  —   wasn't prepared to acknowledge what that meant  —   so she recommended a kind of emotional compromise: Go into one, walk around and then leave. Test the waters. See how it feels. I did. It worked. It usually does, doesn't it? To fully grasp the unique horror of what happened inside Pulse  —   a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla. that became the site of the worst mass shooting in America  —   you have to understand the outsize role that gay bars play in the history, lives and imagination of gay people. They are refuges and havens, places where, the moment you cross the threshold, there is an unspoken understanding: You will feel accepted and safe. In Orlando, that concept was perverted and upended in the most brutal way imaginable. The safe harbor became a bloody death chamber. It was a gay bar that had liberated me and so many of my peers, once we finally summoned the courage to stick around and take a seat, putting us on a long path toward  . Will that change now? Murderous attacks on gay establishments are not new, of course. Arson at a gay lounge in New Orleans in 1973 killed 32 people, a number that was surpassed on Sunday in Orlando.   attacks have occurred at bars across the country. They are shocks, every time, precisely because these spaces exist to shelter their inhabitants from the slights and sallies of the world. It is no accident that a major turning point in the modern   movement took place at a gay bar. The Stonewall Inn, in Manhattan's West Village, was a refuge in a city where bars frequently refused to welcome gay men, lesbians and transgender patrons. When the police raided it in 1969, the gay community rebelled. This was their sanctuary. On Sunday night, in front of the Stonewall Inn, I met a    gay activist, David Drake. Older and wiser than me (I'm now 36) he described the outrage he felt about the Orlando gunman's decision to carry out his massacre at a gay nightclub. His frame of reference was telling. “It's like when the gunman goes into a church and shoots people,” he said. “This is completely wrong. ” “It's sacred,” he said of the bar behind him, draped in   flags. “These spaces, even though they are   ‘bars or clubs,' are those spaces for people in the L. G. B. T. Q. community. Those are the spaces we come to. ” He spoke of the thousands of young gay, bisexual and transgender people who flock to bars and clubs in the West Village: “Night after night after night, these kids come down here because they feel like it's their safe space. The queer kids from various colors, various communities come here because it's their space. They can be who they want, they can be who they are to themselves and each other, to reflect each other, to know each other, to love each other, to discover each other, to grow with each other, in order to become   people. ” The gunman who killed 49 people inside Pulse may have wanted to rob gay bars of that   role, but he did not. He could not."
5429,23346,"Cecile Richards, Barbara Bush and the Sisterhood of Political Progeny - The NY Times",NY Times,Philip Galanes,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"“I love that you still say y'all!” Cecile Richards said to Barbara Bush. Within minutes, both women sounded markedly more Texan than they had when they walked into the restaurant. But Texas twangs may be the least of what they have in common. The families of Ms. Bush, 34, daughter of former President George W. Bush and the chief executive of Global Health Corps, a nonprofit organization, and Ms. Richards, 58, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and daughter of former Gov Ann W. Richards of Texas, go way back. At the 1988 Democratic convention, Gov Richards, who died in 2006, got off one of the best   in memory when she said of former President (and candidate at the time) George Bush: “Poor George. He can't help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth. ” His son George W. evened the score in 1994 by beating her decisively in the Texas governor's race. But there was no trace of animosity when the women met for lunch at Gotham Bar and Grill. They are enthusiastic supporters of each other's work. Before becoming president of Planned Parenthood in 2006, the nation's leading provider of reproductive health services and sex education for women, men and young people, Ms. Richards founded America Votes, a group that coordinates and promotes progressive issues. Before that, she was deputy chief of staff to Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who is now the House minority leader, and worked for many years as a labor organizer. Ms. Bush founded Global Health Corps in 2009 (along with her twin sister, Jenna Bush Hager, and others) to address disparate health results among rich and poor countries. The organization provides yearlong fellowships to young professionals with diverse backgrounds by embedding them in health organizations in Africa and underserved communities in the USA. The number of fellows has grown from 22 in its inaugural year to 140 in its eighth class, which began this month, from a pool of over 5, 000 applicants. Over black cod (for Ms. Bush) and branzino (for Ms. Richards) the pair discussed the challenges of growing up in political families the politicization of health care, especially for women and the coincidence of appearing in a recent collection of essays, “What I Told My Daughter: Lessons from Leaders on Raising the Next Generation of Empowered Women,” edited by Nina Tassler. PHILIP GALANES: Let's start with Nora Ephron, who said that, as a kid, she dreamt of being the president's daughter because of all the attention she'd get, especially from boys. Did that indirect spotlight appeal to you? BARBARA BUSH: I really didn't notice it. I was so young. When I was 8, I asked a friend when her grandfather's inauguration was. I had just been to my grandfather's, and I assumed everybody had one. PG: How about when your father ran for president? BB: We were 18 then. At 18, you're focused on yourself and where you'll go to college. Our parents wanted that for us. CECILE RICHARDS: I was at a very different time in my life. I was 30 when I moved back to Texas to help with Mom's campaign. I had a    daughter and was pregnant with twins at her inauguration. BB: You have twins? I'm a twin. CR: Twins are the best. PG: Did you like campaigning for your mother, or was it an obligation? CR: Oh, there was never any question about it. It's different, running as a woman. And at that point, my mother wasn't married. We were her support system. But it's a mixed bag, seeing your parent run for office. There's a little bit of glamour, but a lot of pain and suffering, watching them go through tough times. BB: I never read the media about my dad. I already had an opinion about him, millions of opinions. I didn't need another person telling me what to think. And when it comes to attacks, people are attacking a caricature. They don't actually know the person. I have the luxury of knowing my parents deeply. CR: A lot of people think of Ann Richards as larger than life. She always said: “Take me, warts and all. ” But I saw the vulnerabilities that the public didn't. One of her favorite things was going to the movies and sitting in the dark. No one could bother her there. PG: You also can't criticize your parents the way we civilians can. The first time I was really aware of Barbara was when you made that P. S. A. for gay marriage. There was a firestorm about your falling out with your father. BB: I didn't realize how much attention that would get. Whoopi Goldberg had done one. And Julianne Moore. They had about 70 views. I didn't think mine was going to get many more. But, of course, it did. Because the narrative was that I was breaking with my father. But I had talked to my dad about doing it, and he was very supportive. What surprised me were all the people who said: “How brave! Betraying your family like that. ” But my parents raised us to use our voices for issues we care about, and I feel strongly about marriage equality. The only brave thing is that I'm shy. That was the win: I used my voice. PG: It was your media debut. Meanwhile, everyone alive must know about Cecile's marathon testimony before Congress last year over the battle to defund Planned Parenthood. Five hours! Lots of coffee or tranquilizers  —   or both? CR: They don't let you do anything. You just sit there, at the pleasure of Congress, while they go in and out, taking breaks and talking in the hallways. I had no idea that it was going to be   on television, or that so many people would watch. I still have people come up to me on the subway and say they watched all five hours. PG: I couldn't believe how rude the congressmen were. In a weird way, did they do you and Planned Parenthood a favor? CR: I think millions of people were exposed to the   of health care, and the aggressive attitudes toward women, the disrespect. It happened to be me, but it could have been any woman. There was a real lack of empathy for what women go through to access health care. PG: Did you walk out of the room thinking, “I just knocked it out of the park”? CR: Oh, no. It was more like: I just survived an endurance test. Later, I read a text from one of my twins, Daniel, who wrote: “Mom, I'm so proud of you. You're doing a great job. And I think raising me really prepared you for this hearing today. ” BB: That's so sweet. PG: It also brings us to your great commonality: women's and global health. With your connections, I bet you could do anything you want. What led you to health care? The last I knew, Barbara was doing an internship at Proenza Schouler. BB: I still love them and would work for them still. PG: I remember an interview with your mother, Laura Bush, who sounded slightly apologetic that you were taking so long to land on a career. And you were only 25. CR: So, we share that, too: mothers who had high expectations for us. It's a lot. BB: I still don't know what my end goal is going to be. CR: Can I say how impressive Barbara is? It's one thing to work at a    organization like Planned Parenthood, trying to shift the boat into the 21st century. But it's another to say: “I see a problem, and I'm going to start an organization to fix it. ” BB: Since I was born, in 1981, we've had the drugs to save the millions of kids around the world who die every year. Yet the number of deaths hasn't dropped at all. We have the tools to keep people healthy, but the systems are broken. CR: All my life, I've been lucky to work in social justice, starting as a labor organizer working with   working women. They're the same ones we see at Planned Parenthood now: women trying to raise their kids, many of them single moms, working two jobs. And if you don't have access to health care, women will put their health after everyone else's. It's like dinner was in Texas: Women took the chicken legs after everyone else had eaten. Women will go without cancer screenings or family planning, which causes unintended pregnancies. Barbara knows this from global health: If women are healthy, their families are healthy, their communities are healthy. It's one of the most powerful ways to make social change. BB: Thanks to my parents, I got lots of exposure. I traveled with them when they launched Pepfar, an amazing program that saves the lives of people with H. I. V. around the world. At that time, if you were H. I. V. positive in the USA, it was just another chronic illness. But in a developing country, it was a death sentence. I met people who were mourning the deaths of their children and sisters, because they didn't have access to drugs that exist. That blew my mind. We have the tools to solve these problems. We just need to use them more effectively. CR: It's the same in reproductive health. We have the technology. But it's not enough unless there's public policy that supports getting women access to care. PG: I can't imagine anyone in America disagreeing with the idea that we should all have health care. So, why is this conversation so poisonous? CR: There's a total disconnect between political rhetoric and where the American people are. They believe folks should have access to health care and family planning. They believe young people should have sex education. No parent wants their child to get an infection, or get pregnant before they're ready. We're at a   low for unintended pregnancy in America. In any other moment, folks would go: “Wow! Let's do more of that. It's good for women and saves money. ” But the political environment is tough right now. BB: It's crazy, and sad to think that health care is a polarizing issue, because it's not a polarizing space. As a human, I hope everyone is healthy. And what happens in other places matters here. We saw that with Ebola. Everyone started paying attention when it seemed like it might impact us. But diseases don't respect international borders. PG: Do you see big roles for storytelling and empathy? CR: So much shame has been placed on women, for having sex or using birth control or choosing to end a pregnancy. When women tell their stories, it makes a big difference. We learned that from the L. G. B. T. community, in terms of knowing people. Women come up to me all the time and thank me for telling my story, and sometimes they tell me theirs. But I was with three women in Pennsylvania, where they were trying to pass an outrageous, restrictive bill on abortions. These women desperately wanted their pregnancies, but learned at 20 weeks about severe fetal abnormalities. And here they were at a press conference, sharing their anguish in front of clicking cameras. I had two thoughts: What bravery. Then, why should they have to bare their souls? I see empathy every day, but I'm sorry that women still have to share their most personal stories. PG: The   millennials play big roles in both your organizations. BB: We think millennials are great. So many young people want to work on social change. They want to do good. Global Health started because this great talent pipeline was not moving into health care. It's hard to know how you fit in if you're not a doctor or nurse. If we can demystify that and create channels into Planned Parenthood and other exceptional organizations, then we'll have an army of people working to solve health problems. CR: Ten years ago, when I came to Planned Parenthood, I met these young kids who were called “peer educators. ” They provided sex education in schools and talked to their principals about access to health care. They were in every town. I thought, “What you really are is leaders. ” And the great thing about bringing in thousands of young people to an organization is they begin to change it. One of the things I'm proud of at Planned Parenthood is the number of health centers providing trans care, which was largely driven by young activists. BB: I didn't know what was in front of me when we were starting Global Health Corps. We didn't even know if anyone would apply. We could never have predicted that a few years in, we'd have gotten to work with 600 amazing young people, 97 percent of whom stay in global health or social justice issues related to it. Our challenge is to keep growing as responsibly as we can. But we see a huge demand. CR: My biggest hope is that we can take partisanship out of this arena. Not to get too political, but we have Republican patients and staff members and board members. The need for health care doesn't come with a party label. Under the Affordable Care Act, every woman who has health insurance gets birth control at no cost. That's 55 million women. We don't have to invent a new kind of birth control. We just have to close the lid between needing it and delivering it. And I'm optimistic that we're on the cusp of making that happen. BB: You've got to be an optimist. PG: Let's end with Nina Tassler's book, “What I Told My Daughter. ” Cecile wrote an essay, and Barbara is the subject of her mom's essay. So, what would you tell young women on the road to empowerment? CR: My mom used to say she saw too many young women passing up opportunities because they were afraid of failing. Her message to me was: “This is the only life you get. Take every chance and run with it  —   even if it doesn't work out. ” BB: When I was thinking about starting Global Health, but afraid I wasn't ready, my mom said: “You're in another job, but always talking about Global Health. Are you going to be happy leaving this on your   list forever?” It's the same with young fellows I speak with. They're worried about taking the “right” next step at the “right” time. But there's never a right time. Who knows where life is going to take us? CR: Exactly. Just do it. What's the worst that could happen?"
5479,23406,"At Cannes, the Ad Industry Confronts the Rise of Facebook - The NY Times",NY Times,Jim Rutenberg,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"CANNES, France  —   The invasion has begun. In the gray light of a summer dawn, the invaders threw their great American force into action here, quickly taking the beach with their blue flags, white beach chairs and   cabanas, a sturdy if sumptuous operating base from which to storm this seaside resort  —   conference room by conference room, rooftop bar by rooftop bar. The frightened townsfolk  —   top executives from the biggest media companies and advertising agencies in the world  —   debated in whispers their grim choice between bloody resistance or total surrender. A correspondent broadcasting from the Hôtel Barrière Le Majestic here reported the words from the blue shirts' communiqué in a quivering voice: “As we connect the world, we believe very deeply in the importance of helping creators build businesses on Facebook [STOP]   …     We are only here to help [STOP]   …     Why don't you believe us? [STOP]” The preceding paragraphs were based on The NY Times's report on the Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944  —   loosely, very loosely. They capture the sense of siege that was palpable here last week during the annual Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, where Facebook has one of the most visible   headquarters along the beach, with a pier festooned with its logo and a club on the sand. But in this case, no one was prepared to view the seaside regiment as a liberating force. On the surface, this festival is a great bacchanalia the advertising industry holds with its clients and business partners in Big Consumer Goods, Big Entertainment and Big Journalism. Over six days they celebrate the year's best advertising, while massaging relationships and cutting deals over   meals and at    soirees that have acts like Chris Martin and Wyclef Jean. But in a week in which Britain was preparing to make its exit from the EU  —   sending the Continent toward an uncertain realignment  —   it was fitting that the real action here involved a war for territory in a media world heading for its own painful realignment, its old borders withering away at the speed of Moore's Law (which holds that computing power increases twofold every two years or so). Google and Facebook have upended the old order by taking ownership of the new one, claiming nearly   of the $60 billion online advertising market last year and on course to take more this year. Therefore, the word of the week in Cannes was “duopoly. ” You could understand why the gathered Mad Men and Women were so mad. For decades, they have enjoyed mutually beneficial relationships with their big clients  —     Procter  Gamble, Unilever  —   reaping great riches by catering to Americans' wants and tastes, having divined them through focus groups and surveys. Then along came Google and Facebook, using their   technologies to insert themselves into those advertising relationships, but with a huge advantage  —   they weren't just divining their users' tastes and preferences, they knew them. They controlled the data. And as advertising goes more digital, he or she who controls the data controls the market. If I'm you, the reader, I'm wondering why I should care isn't it like the old mob complaining about the new mob being unschooled in the honor code of omertà? Well, there are much larger questions at play. When one or two companies gain control over a market, it creates dangerous asymmetries that skew competitive balance. And the market we're talking about isn't making widgets. It delivers what we read and watch every day, and increasingly every minute: the news and information our democracy needs. Think about it this way: The shift in advertising revenue to Google and Facebook contributed last year to the worst year for newspaper revenues since the economic crash in 2009, a recent Pew Research Center study found. Dwindling advertising revenue equals dwindling foreign bureaus equals “Surprise: Brexit!” While Google has usually been the chief villain here, Facebook seemed to have assumed the role of Frenemy No. 1. Two hours didn't go by here without some top executive telling me about how Facebook's “walled garden” makes it a new intermediary between brands and their customers, and between newspapers and their readers. That gives Facebook the potential to steal them all away if it ever chose to do so. (It says it won't.) Facebook, which maintained a fortresslike presence here within the Hotel Majestic as well on the beach, had a simple message: We Come in Peace, and we need the ad world. “Our point of view on this is that the whole industry has to collaborate more than ever,” Carolyn Everson, Facebook's vice president for global marketing solutions, told me. “There is a massive shift in the industry. ” That shift is to mobile phones, where more and more digital advertising is going. But the industry hasn't quite figured out how to make us regularly watch more than three seconds of a   video ad, or to click on a mobile display ad on purpose. “We desperately need the agency ecosystem to support and drive this shift to mobile marketing,” Ms. Everson said. Figuring it out is in everybody's interest. Advertising executives here voiced respect for Ms. Everson, who came to Facebook from Viacom via Microsoft a few years ago, when relations were at a low. And they credited Facebook for giving them and their clients access to some 1. 6 billion users. Yet, in a dozen or so lengthy conversations I had with   agency and marketing executives, suspicion of Facebook abounded. Sure, some of it could have been because while the executives were talking about existential threats to their business, Facebook was here introducing cool new advertising opportunities on Instagram and Messenger. But a lot of it stemmed from the view that Facebook's Silicon Valley happy talk about “collaboration” and “connectivity” rings hollow in light of its seemingly aggressive push to grab more media and advertising territory away from them. You can point to a clash between NY cynicism and West Coast idealism, but there is a history. Several years ago, Facebook invited advertisers to set up fan pages at no cost. As more advertisers jumped in, their messages became overwhelming. Facebook scaled them back. But then it offered the brands a chance to increase visibility by paying for it  —   that is, to reach the customer fan base that Facebook had initially invited them to create free. You can imagine how that went over. Facebook has been doing a better job of avoiding such surprises, Ben Winkler, the chief investment officer at OMD, told me at his company's beachside tent. But, he said, when Facebook is the mediator between advertisers and their customers, “They become Facebook's customers first and the brands' customers second,” leaving the question, “Who owns the customer data?” The nearly universal complaint in Cannes was that Facebook was not doing enough to share that data, leaving an informational imbalance that, combined with Facebook's digital market share, gives it asymmetrical negotiating leverage. That's why Tamara Ingram, the J. Walter Thompson chief executive, told me it was important for Facebook  —   a “wonderful” medium, she said  —   “to have a transparent and symmetrical relationship that allows us to build brands. ” (Italics mine.) Ms. Everson said that Facebook's imperative to protect the privacy of its users precludes deeper sharing. But, she said, it has sophisticated tools to help its partners contact customers and likely customers without making them identifiable. Facebook's Madison Avenue “partners” wonder if Facebook isn't hiding behind privacy to protect its own market advantage. “We fully understand that the users' privacy is sacrosanct,” Irwin Gotlieb, the chairman of GroupM Global, the huge advertising buying firm, told me. “But there are ways to share data without compromising it everyone else has found ways to do it. ” When I passed through Cannes at daybreak on Friday  —   on my way to an appearance on Facebook Live, which Facebook is paying my company $3 million to try  —   I saw a young man passed out by the beach. I didn't have time to find out, but I wondered: A happy reveler who overimbibed with colleagues in the spirit of collaboration? Or a casualty of the Great Facebook Siege of 2016?"
5768,23811,"After BatonRouge Flooding, Learning Lessons From New Orleans - The NY Times",NY Times,Campbell Robertson and Alan Blinder,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"BatonRouge, La.  —   Darren McKinney knows about floods, having spent days huddling in the upper rooms of a house when the waters of Hurricane Katrina drowned his New Orleans neighborhood, the Lower Ninth Ward, 11 years ago this month. And so on Saturday afternoon, at a house in a BatonRouge subdivision that had been flooded a week earlier, Mr. McKinney passed his knowledge on to a group of volunteers from lowernine. org, a nonprofit organization founded after Hurricane Katrina: cut the drywall here, this high up, and pull out the insulation like this. “Because I've been through it,” he said, “I know the dos and don'ts. ” There are plenty here in south Louisiana who have been forced to learn this kind of thing, and plenty who have learned much larger lessons as well. Those lessons include how to get money most efficiently from the federal government and ways to avoid leaving thousands of people for years in temporary shelters, like the notorious Federal Emergency Management Agency trailers, as the rebuilding proceeds. The big thoughts and small details constitute a grimly earned expertise here and particularly in New Orleans, which sits just 75 miles down the road. It is a   that will now be drawn on considerably, with   devastation across 20 parishes, at least 60, 600 homes damaged or ruined, and the long and often exasperating road to recovery just now beginning. “The silver lining, if there is any silver lining, is that this sits in a large region that has a lot of experience with rebuilding and recovery,” said Mary L. Landrieu, a former USA senator from Louisiana, and a veteran of funding fights during the hurricane recovery. “They don't have to go far to find experts. ” Many organizations that came into existence to tackle problems after Hurricane Katrina are now on the front lines of this recovery, which Obama will survey during a visit on Tuesday. The Louisiana Civil Justice Center, started in the months after the hurricane to respond to the many and confounding legal issues of the poor, is the official statewide legal aid resource in the state bar association's disaster plan. The St. Bernard Project, a nonprofit rebuilding group which now calls itself SBP and was started by two volunteers in 2006 in a parking lot in a wrecked parish outside of New Orleans, is planning to open at least one office, if not several, in BatonRouge. The group's leaders have been in talks with advertising firms in New Orleans about campaigns to educate people about how to navigate the FEMA process for grants and loans, how to avoid being defrauded by contractors and how to do some   work without any outside help at all. All are things that the group learned after Hurricane Katrina and in subsequent relief efforts elsewhere around the country. “The fact is, disaster recovery hasn't worked well in America, ever,” said Zack Rosenburg, one of the founders of the group, which has done rebuilding work after floods in South Carolina and West Virginia. “It's an extraordinarily challenging process. ” On Saturday, some of the original members of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, the state agency set up to oversee the rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina, met with local and state officials at the offices of the BatonRouge Area Foundation, a civic group, to talk about the lessons of the last 11 years. With homes in Louisiana still underwater, the talk was preliminary, said John Spain, the executive vice president of the foundation. But there was plenty to look back at and see as experiences not to repeat. “We're 11 years after Katrina, and only 60 percent of the housing stock in St. Bernard Parish is back,” Mr. Spain said, referring to a parish just east of New Orleans that was almost entirely destroyed by the levee failures after the hurricane. This time, it was Livingston Parish, just east of BatonRouge, that was almost entirely flooded. “It's important that we don't repeat mistakes whether it's from Sandy or Katrina or Gustav. ” Part of the issue then was how long it took for homes to be rebuilt and essential services to come back. After Hurricane Katrina, thousands endured extended stays in FEMA trailers, and thousands of others eventually settled down permanently in cities elsewhere, bleeding New Orleans of its population. In this flood response, several officials said, FEMA is pursuing a strategy of getting people to move back as quickly as possible into at least one or two rooms of their   houses, an aim that would depend on quick payments and a work force of volunteers. “Our efforts to help the schools get back open and get as many people back in their home as soon as possible is going to minimize the effect we had after Katrina,” said Lt. Gov Billy Nungesser, a Republican, who praised the federal response. “Right after Katrina, we didn't see that passion to really help,” he said. Still, there is plenty that has not been learned, or learned but not fixed. A report released last year by Save the Children, an advocacy group, found that few of the recommendations of a federal commission on children and disasters, which was set up after Hurricane Katrina, have been carried out nationally. And those who have worked with poor and   families since Hurricane Katrina expect to see many of the exact same problems they saw over the last decade, even if they now feel more savvy about fighting them. “The kinds of things you're going to see early on are things like people facing a potential eviction because housing is scarce,” said Laura Tuggle, the executive director of the Southeast Louisiana Legal Services, which helped the poor after Hurricane Katrina. She ticked off some more of what she expected: sudden sharp rises in rent, withheld deposits, increases in domestic violence for those stuck in close quarters and, for homeowners, complicated title problems that could jeopardize access to assistance. All of these are matters that lawyers with her group had to tackle after Hurricane Katrina. She has already gotten calls about some of them this time. “You know what needs to be done,” Ms. Tuggle said, recalling the months during which she was unable to get back to her home in New Orleans in 2005. “Because we've been there. ” Betty Michelli, 63, of BatonRouge, has now been there, though she had never been there before. On Saturday, volunteers with the St. Bernard Project were gutting her house and piling debris out on the front lawn. She and her husband stood in the hot garage, going over all that they do not know about disasters, from how FEMA is supposed to contact them, to how one gets loans from the Small Business Administration, to what exactly they are going to be doing next. “I don't know,” she said. “I just sit down and cry. ”"
5811,23872,Trump Tries a Jarring New Style: Diplomatic - The NY Times,NY Times,Michael Barbaro,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"He did not mock. He did not scold. He did not blunder. Instead when Donald J. Trump showed up for a hastily assembled statelike visit at the presidential palace in Mexico City on Wednesday, he managed to accomplish something that he had failed to do throughout the campaign: communicate his provocative political ideas with something resembling diplomacy. Standing beneath a Mexican flag, Mr. Trump lamented the crimes committed by immigrants, but without his usually harsh, insulting and alarmist language. He described undocumented Mexican immigrants, but not in the ugly, racially charged ways he has in the past. And he talked about building a wall on America's southern border, but in newly measured, less belligerent terms. “We recognize and respect the right of either country to build a physical barrier,” he said, before adding, almost sheepishly, “a wall. ” It was Trumpism in an unfamiliar but somehow still recognizable form: shorn of its most offensive elements but faithful to its essential message. In many ways, it was Mr. Trump's most successful performance of the summer, after weeks of agonizing gaffes, missed opportunities and flagging poll numbers. Of course, as with so much surrounding Mr. Trump, the day was immediately dogged by questions of candor. Mexico's president, Enrique Peña Nieto, claimed that in their meeting he had told Mr. Trump his country would never pay for the wall, while Mr. Trump declared that the two men had never touched on who would shoulder the cost of its construction. It was not clear whether the discrepancy was the result of the language barrier or Mr. Trump's tendency to spin the facts in his favor. Still, by the end of Mr. Trump's   news conference beside Mr. Peña Nieto, it was clear that despite his struggling campaign, the Republican nominee retains a showman's instincts. Breaking protocol, Mr. Trump, a guest in the home of a foreign president, called on reporters himself, seemingly ignoring the head of state standing a few feet to his right. “Say it!” Mr. Trump declared as he pointed at reporters he knew from the USA. “Yes?” he called to another journalist. When an ABC reporter asked both men about the hurtful words that Mr. Trump had used in the past to describe Mexico, the candidate did not bother to wait for the president to speak first. It might have been Mexican soil, but the stage was still Mr. Trump's. “We'll, I'll start,” he said. He leaned in and offered his reply. Still, at times, especially during the starch exchange of formal statements, Mr. Trump seemed out of his element. As Mr. Peña Nieto spoke at length, Mr. Trump appeared uncomfortable and almost sullen, swiveling slightly side to side, crossing his arms and looking down, rather than at the president. He seemed incapable of maintaining the polite expression of interest that is customary for such occasions. Mr. Trump occasionally nodded as his translator whispered in his ear as Mr. Peña Nieto delivered his prepared remarks in Spanish. (Mr. Trump does not speak Spanish.) The tableau itself was startling: Mr. Trump, who has mercilessly maligned Mexico, standing inside the Mexican's president's home surrounded by the pomp and ceremony of a formal summit meeting. The grand house sits amid open fields, trees, foliage and a large complex of buildings that drown out noise from the surrounding city. An air of improbability hovered over Mr. Trump's entire trip to Mexico. Much of the country was astonished that the NY   developer had pounced on a seemingly perfunctory invitation from its president. “I think it's unlikely that the Mexican government really expected Trump to take them up on this invitation,” said Christopher Wilson, the deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. But take up the invitation Mr. Trump did. It is the kind of dramatic,   development and plot twist that Mr. Trump relishes. It was Mr. Trump, after all, who theatrically boycotted an all but mandatory Republican presidential debate in Iowa in January, commandeering an auditorium a few blocks away to put on a   show taunting his rivals. “Where's Trump?” he asked, mischievously imitating the rest of the Republican presidential field across town. Despite predictions that his absence would prove disastrous, he finished second in the state's caucuses and continued to roll up big victories. In the hours before Mr. Trump landed in Mexico, there were similar predictions of doom. And with reason. This was the same man who, after Britain voted to leave the EU, bragged on his golf course in Scotland that the rupture would be good for business there. In Mexico, his rougher edges seemed sanded down as he offered flattery and solicitousness in place of crudeness and brickbats. The   he knew, he said, “were beyond reproach. ” He described generations of their   families as “amazing people. ” Even as Mr. Peña Nieto seemed to subtly criticize him  —   by reminding Mr. Trump that illegal immigration had fallen significantly over the past decade and vigorously defending the North American Free Trade Agreement  —   Mr. Trump suppressed any urge to trade fire. Instead, he looked over at the president of a country he has denounced for over a year and told him what an honor it was to meet him. “I call you a friend,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Peña Nieto."
5815,23877,"Scheduled Flights to Cuba From U.S. Begin Again, Now With Jet Engines - The NY Times",NY Times,Frances Robles,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.  —   Amid live Cuban music, fresh guava pastries and a water cannon salute, the first scheduled passenger jet service in history between Cuba and the USA began on Wednesday with a 9:45 flight from here to Santa Clara, east of Havana. The flight on JetBlue, the first regularly scheduled flight from the USA to Cuba in more than 50 years, was another important step toward normalized relations between two former Cold War foes, which promises to sharply reduce airfares and ease travel between the nations. It had been so long since an airline in the USA flew a regularly scheduled flight to the island that the last time it happened, the passengers flew on a propeller plane. Erik Díaz Oliva, 41, choked back tears as he described the significance of flying on the first scheduled flight to his home country after eight years away. “I got here at 5 a. m. and was the first to check in everyone started to cheer!” Mr. Díaz said. “To the people who say these flights don't help: Yes, it does help. It opens Cuba to the world. ” The scheduled air service was the latest in a string of important changes between the nations since Obama decided in 2014 to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba. Embassies were opened, direct mail service was restored and Carnival Cruise Line ships have sailed to Cuba. Other moves, like ferry service and the building in Cuba of an American company's tractor assembly plant, were authorized by the Obama administration, but were stalled by the Cuban government. “Today opens the door to further exchange between the American people and the Cuban people,” Anthony Foxx, the USA transportation secretary, said in an interview. “We think that's ultimately good for the expansion of freedom and democracy. ” Mr. Foxx was among the inaugural flight's 150 passengers, which included more than two dozen journalists and assorted dignitaries. “This is a novelty for me, to be able to fly direct without having to travel to a third country,” said Orestes García Vásquez, 68, who was traveling from Villa Clara to South Florida. “This allows me to save time and money. ” Cuba and the USA agreed to allow up to 90 daily   flights between the two nations, the Department of Transportation said. Six airlines have been approved for flights to nine Cuban cities other than Havana, but not all of them have announced their schedules. Mr. Foxx said far more airlines had expressed interest in flying to Havana, the capital, than could be accommodated. “I haven't seen anything like it,” he said. On Wednesday, the Department of Transportation announced that Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines and United Airlines would operate the coveted Havana flights. The airlines will fly from Atlanta Charlotte, N. C. Fort Lauderdale Houston Los Angeles Miami Newark NY Orlando, Fla. and Tampa, Fla. Calling it “good pressure,” Mr. Foxx acknowledged that Cuba would have to improve its airport infrastructure to be able to handle the increased flow of airlines. The country is notorious for poor airport facilities, and passengers often endure hourslong waits because baggage carousels or staircases needed to disembark are tied up. José Ramón Cabañas Rodríguez, Cuba's ambassador to the USA, said the country's 10 international airports were safe and secure and had fielded nearly 5, 000 charter flights from the USA last year. He added that the flight on Wednesday was yet another first for the two countries announced in the past few months. “We hope that in the near future, all remaining obstacles that limit further exchange between the two countries will be removed,” he said, referring to the American trade embargo, which remains in place. For passengers, the difference will be immense. Until now, people flying to Cuba had to book charter flights, which meant passengers had to arrive at the airport four hours before takeoff and were charged steep fees for luggage. Prices were high, lines were long and flights were often hours late. The document review process was   and passengers stood in separate lines to check in, check bags, have bags weighed and pay for the checked luggage. “The last time I went to Cuba, I paid $300 or $400 just for the luggage  —   absurd!” said Yosleidys Rodríguez, 39, who left Cuba less than two years ago for South Florida. “This is the best thing that could have happened. ” Now customers who qualify under the 12 authorized categories approved for travel can book flights directly on an airline's website, and many have paid fares as low as $99 each way. JetBlue expects to have up to seven daily flights to Cuba, although most of them will go to cities other than Havana, like Holguín and Camagüey. They are set to begin in the fall. Silver Airways, a commuter airline, on Thursday will begin offering three weekly flights to Santa Clara, and later this year will start flights to Cienfuegos, Santiago de Cuba, Cayo Coco, Varadero, Cayo Largo and Manzanillo. American Airlines begins service on Sept. 7 to Cienfuegos and Holguín, and will expand to three more Cuban cities later in the year. Although the number of Americans flying to Cuba has been steadily increasing, experts say it is unlikely that the market will be able to bear such an abundance of seats. “There's going to be a lot of seats on the market,” said Michael Zuccato of Cuba Travel Services, a charter company whose business is in peril now that consumers can book directly with airlines. “I do not believe the flights are going to be full. ” Marty St. George, the executive vice president of JetBlue, said the airline expected brisk business, particularly among Cubans visiting their families. “We do think it's an important part of history,” Mr. St. George said. “From a challenge perspective, we know the drill. Cuba has some unique elements because of 50 years of history between the U. S. and Cuba, but we're ready to go. ”"
5816,23878,"In Afghanistan's Farm Belt, Women Lead Unions and Find New Status - The NY Times",NY Times,Mujib Mashal,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"SHIBAR, Afghanistan  —   In this lush farm belt deep in central Afghanistan, women have been the organizing force behind a new wave of small village farm unions. That seems to have brought some changes. In a reversal of tradition, husbands tend to walk after their wives, trailing a couple of steps behind with   sleeves and   faces. And critically for this impoverished region, the unions have established modest supply chains at the market in the center of Bamian Province. Over just a few years, they have introduced new vegetables to their humble dinner plates. “In the old days, only potatoes and wheat were grown here,” said Zainab Husseini, a   high school biology teacher and the   farming union leader in the village of  . “Now we introduced cabbage, cauliflower, tomatoes, beans and other vegetables. ” The unions, in updating   agricultural traditions, have helped ensure a more reliable and diverse food supply in an often   region. In the process, the women who run the groups are finding new status and empowerment. They are no longer greeted as the mother of Ahmad or the wife of Mahmoud, but rather “union leader Gul Bahar” or “deputy union leader Reza Gul. ” The unions have put the women of Bamian on the front line of a critical struggle: the effort to shape a sustainable Afghan economy, away from dependence on foreign aid. Agriculture must surely be a crucial part of the program if that is to happen. Close to 40 percent of the population remains below the poverty line of $1. 35 a day, Afghan officials say. According to the World Bank, more than 80 percent of the Afghan population  —   and about 90 percent of the poor  —   live in rural communities. Agriculture is therefore central not just to countering widespread malnutrition in remote areas, but also to creating sustainable jobs. Assadullah Zamir, Afghanistan's minister of agriculture, says one area that requires focus is linking farmers to local and national markets, and helping their crops compete with cheap imports by imposing tariffs on, for example, Pakistani vegetables. “The production has increased with programs and training, and the market is not enough it is not sufficient,” Mr. Zamir said. If Afghanistan can better manage its water resources and establish decent connections between farms and markets  —   a critical problem in the middle of a war where battles are fought with roadside bombs and security checkpoints  —   the agriculture sector could create two million to five million sustainable new jobs, or even double the industry's percentage of the country's gross domestic product, according to Afghan officials and economic analysts. But here in remote Bamian, the terrain itself poses a huge challenge to bringing crops to market. To get to Shibar, one must drive from the provincial capital of Bamian for about an hour, up a narrow dirt track carved along the mountains. The car slowly winds its way so high along the mountaintop that the clouds hang nearly at arm's length. Then, even more slowly, as the path descends in spiraling bends, the car splashes through sudden creeks of snow melt that run through narrow gorges. After the Taliban destroyed giant Buddha statues in 2001, Bamian Province became associated mainly with one thing: potatoes. Lots of potatoes. In 2015, Bamian produced nearly 350, 000 tons of potatoes, about 60 percent of Afghanistan's total consumption, according to the country's Ministry of Agriculture. But an overabundance of that single product became a headache for farmers in Shibar, leaving them vulnerable to trader exploitation and struggling to meet their own basic food needs for most of the year. During harvest season, the potatoes are sold wholesale at   prices: roughly $150 a ton. The farmers have no way of holding on to the potatoes for the winter months, when wholesale prices double. The approximately 500 cold storage facilities built in Bamian with the help of the Afghan government in recent years are simply not enough. (The smaller facilities hold about 15 tons, and the larger community ones about 60 tons.) That realization forced the Afghan government and its international partners a few years ago to encourage growing new crops, and women like Ms. Husseini took the lead in Shibar. About five years ago, Ms. Husseini tapped into a local women's rights group she was leading to form small farmers' unions and seek help from the Afghan Ministry of Agriculture. The ministry, which formally recognized the unions in 2013, provided sample plots where farmers could plant improved seeds and learn new techniques from visiting trainers, like using different plant spacing or drip irrigation systems. “In the old days, the potatoes were this small,” Ms. Husseini, the union leader in   said, picking up a tiny rock. “When traders would come, they would set aside half of it as not good. Now they want all of it. Each potato weighs one kilogram on average. ” There are now eight village farmers' unions in Shibar, each comprising about 30 women. In addition to improving potato production, they have turned to new vegetables and, more recently, even started fruit orchards. In her small vegetable plot, Najia, the deputy union leader in   grew lettuce, cabbage and tomatoes last year. The lettuce brought her about $70, the tomatoes about $80 and the cabbage about $40. Najia is also in charge of the unions' relations with the market in Bamian's provincial capital, supplying fresh vegetables to six shops that they have established deals with  —   a very small market, but a start. Every time other union members have crops to sell, they all bring their produce to Najia, who arranges for a vehicle to take them to the market. But getting to the market is incredibly costly: Renting a small truck to take the goods there on the bumpy, narrow road out of Shibar costs about $20  —   a large sum, considering how little the farmers currently make. The Afghan government, which often uses nongovernmental organizations as implementing partners, prioritizes the extremely poor for many of its agricultural projects. So even a small grant like giving a family a sheep or a cow, as well as teaching them ways to grow and sell their products, makes a big difference. “When we go back two years later, for example, each of them have expanded that to at least three or four sheep, or sold some of the sheep to buy a cow,” said Dr. Mariam Habib, who ran one of these   programs in Bamian. With their increased economic activity and their handle of the cash flow, women say they also notice a change in their standing in the community. “Everyone invites me to parties, and they even consult me on matters now,” one gaptoothed older woman, waving her hands, told a visiting delegation of officials recently. She could not be reached for identification afterward. But in Shibar, as they increase production and earn more, some of the female union leaders bemoan a compromise that is forced on them: The new potatoes taste different. “The new potatoes are now white in the middle and have a great market, but they don't taste the same,” said Asma, the deputy chief of one union. For her own cooking, she grows the old seeds."

5825,23888,The News From Trump Changed. The Main Story Was Slow to Catch Up. - The NY Times,NY Times,Liz Spayd,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"It was a   day for the team covering politics at The NY Times on Wednesday. In the late afternoon, Donald J. Trump was playing the diplomat in Mexico City with President Enrique Peña Nieto, standing alongside a state leader and vowing to treat everyone living or residing in the USA with great dignity. “So important,” Trump added. By that evening, Trump was goosing a rowdy crowd in Phoenix and ensuring that anyone who entered the USA illegally would be subject to deportation, especially the criminals among them. The problem back in The Times's newsroom was that its main news story  —   published online after Trump spoke in Phoenix  —   captured more of Mexico's demure Trump than the familiar firebrand who jetted to Arizona. For many readers, the story looked like a significant misportrayal of events. Anyone coming to the Times site around 11 p. m. over an hour after Trump's speech began, saw a story that seemed blind to the angry, aggressive rhetoric that Trump delivered to his voting base along the border. Liam Burke of San Jose, Calif. was among them. “As others have no doubt mentioned, I was surprised to see the lede to this article,” he wrote. “This description of Trump's speech seems simply false and diminishing of the extreme,   racist rhetoric he offered. As the paper of record, don't you feel you have a responsibility to accurately represent the intensity of Trump's rage and the danger he poses to American values?” I can see why Burke and others are questioning the piece. They should be. After all, it seemed not to match the Trump they just saw on TV, even though the Times story was posted after the Arizona event. Here's the top of the piece: This 11 p. m. version made no mention of Trump's invitation to have individuals join him onstage to share the names of relatives who they said were killed by illegal immigrants. Nor did it refer to Trump's line that his enforcement priorities would include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays and those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net, along with millions of recent illegal arrivals. That doesn't sound like a stark turnaround from the old Trump. Several prominent components of the coverage, including a live chat at the top of the homepage, were being quickly updated with the Arizona Trump. But the main news story was not significantly updated until an hour later, around midnight. By then it captured the more aggressive Trump and delivered a more balanced portrayal of the day. What happened? Why did the first version seem so off and why wasn't The Times more transparent about the changes? I asked Carolyn Ryan, The Times's political editor, for an explanation. “Trump acted jarringly differently in Phoenix than he did in Mexico, and we scrambled to reflect that, without obscuring the fact that he was backing away from his policy to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants,” she said. “I think readers were eager to see the fiery language and belligerent tone in Phoenix reflected quickly in the story, especially if they had just watched his appearance, and I understand that. ” What that boils down to is: We were moving as fast as we could and the story changed on us. The flaw in hanging this simply on tight deadlines and   facts is that many other major news sites managed to hit the mark. Politico was up not long after the Times article with a piece that said Trump squashed any speculation that he might soften on immigration, “delivering a hawkish, hardline, and     border platform and vowing that on Day One of his administration, the USA would launch a mammoth deportation program and begin construction of a wall. ” The Washington Post, also posting around the same time, had updated its article to say that hours after leaving Mexico Trump returned to his aggressive tenor on immigration, yelling at the crowd in Arizona and promising to subject illegals to deportation. The Arizona Republic was up with a similar piece. Ryan maintains that The Times was on the news too. She said that there has been too much focus on this single piece. Her team, she said, primarily relies on both live discussions and concise briefings on breaking news, and indeed these features dominated the homepage Wednesday night. “We aggressively update our coverage, minute by minute, through our live chat, which highlights and analyzes political events as they unfold, and our live briefing, which tells readers what they have missed,” she said. “Both are enormously popular with readers, and they have given us a flexible platform to drive   coverage in politics. ” Worthwhile point. But I'm not sure that a rolling discussion among staff members and a briefing roundup satisfies the needs of readers landing on the Times site wanting a clear sense of a confusing story. And if all the reporters on the live chat are up on the latest developments, why can't some of that make it into the main news story? Here's my take. I see nothing nefarious or   on the part of any editors or reporters involved in the Trump piece. Everyone was scrambling with   news across time zones, many moving parts, and both print and web deadlines. But given the complications of the story  —   an unpredictable candidate, brutal deadlines  —   it seems the newsroom was not in position to deliver a strong coverage package. None of the main political writers were on the scene in Mexico City or in Arizona and Patrick Healy, writer of the lead story, drew the short straw of producing both the version for the print edition and for the web. In this instance, Healy would have greatly benefited from being relieved of writing the print story in order to concentrate on the web. That might have given him some extra time to absorb the news in Phoenix and make sense of the changing rhetoric. All of this may sound like tedious newsroom mechanics, but mistakes can have a genuine impact on The Times's reputation among readers. In a climate where sinister motives are attached to every word and headline The Times produces, looking squarely at such episodes is a step worth taking."
6302,24531,Why the Trump Team's Economic Promises Will Be Hard to Execute - The NY Times,NY Times,Neil Irwin,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   The middle class will see a big tax cut, but the wealthy will not. American businesses will pay much lower taxes, and as a consequence bring back billions of dollars from overseas. All this will create sustained growth of 3 to 4 percent a year and prevent the budget deficit from exploding. That is the economic future described on Wednesday by the people   Donald J. Trump's has chosen to lead the Treasury and Commerce Departments, Steven Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross. But in making those bold promises, the two men have contradicted some of Mr. Trump's campaign pledges, promised economic growth targets that will be difficult to achieve given modern demographics, and committed to plans that even sympathetic analysts project will vastly widen the budget deficit. The comments shed light on how two men tapped as top economic policy makers in the Trump administration view their job ahead  —   but also expose what will be challenging about getting campaign goals accomplished. “Any reductions we have in upper income taxes will be offset by less deductions so that there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class,” Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday morning. “There will be a big tax cut for the middle class, but any tax cuts we have for the upper class will be offset by less deductions that pay for it. ” That is not what independent analysts concluded after analyzing the tax proposal Mr. Trump made during his campaign, which would reduce the income tax rate on the wealthiest families from its current 39. 6 percent to 33 percent. In that plan,   families would see a 0. 8 percent increase in their   income, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation, while the top 1 percent of taxpayers would see a 10. 2 to 16 percent gain. Another group, the Tax Policy Center, calculated   families would get a 1. 8 percent boost in   income, while the top 0. 1 percent of earners would see a 14 percent gain and a tax cut worth an average of $1. 1 million. But Mr. Mnuchin was talking big: “This will be the largest tax change since Reagan. ” Mr. Mnuchin suggested closing some tax loopholes would counter the effect of lower tax rates for the rich, but he mentioned only one: a cap on the mortgage interest deduction. Tax reformers have long suggested that mortgage payments should either no longer be deductible or be capped for mansions and second homes. Mr. Trump's Treasury pick did not clarify what he meant. It was not clear whether the comments on Wednesday represented a shift in Mr. Trump's tax policy intentions or political spin. “What he described there doesn't match the plan unveiled in September,” said Alan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation. “This statement could be a legitimate pivot, or it could be hand waving. I don't know which. ” One promise of Mr. Mnuchin's that matched Mr. Trump's was a 15 percent corporate income tax rate, a huge cut from the current 35 percent. Leaders in both parties favor a lower corporate rate, paid for with a simpler tax code with far fewer deductions and dodges. But former Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner could get the rate down only to 28 percent when he ran the numbers. Even House Republicans have aimed for 25 percent. “We're going to cut corporate taxes, which will bring huge amounts of jobs back to the USA. We're going to get to 15 percent, and we're going to bring a lot of cash back to the U. S.,” Mr. Mnuchin said. Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Ross suggested that the plans would not widen the budget deficit thanks to “dynamic scoring,” or forecasts that assume tax cuts will release much faster economic growth and therefore pay for themselves. But the Trump tax cuts would need to unleash far faster growth than the historical record suggests is likely to avoid rapidly increasing the budget deficit. The Tax Foundation's analysis of the September Trump campaign plan found that even with dynamic scoring, the plan would reduce federal revenue by $2. 6 trillion to $3. 9 trillion over the next decade, which absent spending cuts would enlarge the deficit by up to   over levels the Congressional Budget Office projects. And the Trump nominees stuck with a bullish forecast for   growth. “Our No. 1 priority is going to be the economy, get back to 3 to 4 percent growth,” Mr. Mnuchin told reporters gathered at Trump Tower in Manhattan on Wednesday. “We believe that's very sustainable. ” It is true that economic growth averaged around 3. 5 percent a year in the second half of the 20th century, before falling to around 2 percent a year in the last 15 years. In trying to achieve that goal, though, the Trump administration will face significant demographic headwinds. The speedy growth of the last century was helped along by the enormous baby boom generation entering the work force, and more women joining the ranks of the working. Now, the baby boom is retiring and the proportion of women working is stable. For those reasons, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the USA labor force will grow by 0. 6 percent a year over the next decade. By contrast, from 1949 to 2000 it rose by an average of 1. 7 percent a year. Another complication to the Trump team's predictions? Mr. Trump has promised tight controls on immigration, the one lever that could increase work force growth. To achieve the economic strength that the Trump administration is aiming for, either something will need to change existing demographic trends, such as higher immigration levels or   retirees working longer, or American businesses will need to find ways to become sharply more productive than they have been in recent years. In other words, as the Trump economic team forms and tries to turn bold campaign promises into policy reality, it may find that the biggest limit of all is economic math."
6304,24533,Colombia's Congress Approves Peace Accord With FARC - The NY Times,NY Times,Nicholas Casey,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Colombia's Congress approved a revised peace accord with the country's largest rebel group on Wednesday night, a vote that was most likely the final hurdle in ratifying the troubled agreement whose earlier version had been rejected in a referendum this fall. By pushing the new deal through Congress, the government bypassed voters this time, who had turned down the accord by a narrow margin on Oct. 2. Both the Senate and House of Representatives, controlled by President Juan Manuel Santos's governing coalition, voted overwhelmingly for the agreement. But congressional opponents of the deal had walked out of the chamber in protest before the vote took place. On Twitter, Mr. Santos expressed “gratitude to Congress for approving the new accords. ” His chief rival and predecessor, Álvaro Uribe, in an earlier Twitter post, said the congressional action was an attempt to replace a popular mandate. Mr. Santos's opponents in the Congress were furious the new accord had been pushed through with what they said was too little time to either comment or review the changes. The president, who has staked his legacy on ending the long conflict with the rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, consulted his opponents shortly after the referendum was defeated, but he has largely kept them in the dark since, they said. The Congress's vote brings to a close what had become one of the country's biggest political dramas in decades. After years of tense talks in Havana, rebel and government negotiators announced in August they had reached a deal to end a half century of war which left more than 200, 000 people dead. The next month, the rebels arrived to the port city of Cartagena, where a celebratory signing was held before world leaders and televised to the nation. Just one piece remained: A popular vote to approve the accord, which polls had shown would be a  . Instead, it lost by a narrow margin. Then days later, in another twist, Mr. Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In their announcement of the prize, the Norwegian judges acknowledged the referendum's defeat but said they hoped that the prize would “give him strength to succeed in this demanding task. ” Though most voters supported peace with the rebels, many, noting the FARC's long history of kidnappings and killings, felt the deal offered too much leniency, including reduced sentences in exchange for confessions. Yet Mr. Santos also faced a challenge in renegotiating new terms with the rebels, who had been promised new lives as civilians and a clean slate. Analysts say the new deal took some steps to address some of the objections. The agreement now offers some clarity over what to expect as rebels accused of various offenses, including war crimes and drug trafficking, go before a special court. That was one of the opposition's demands, but the new accord still does not allow for prison sentences for those who confessed to war crimes, which the government said would have caused FARC to leave the negotiating table. The agreement also guarantees former rebels representation in Congress, but it bans them from running in newly created districts in former conflict zones. Mr. Santos's office said the president would give a speech on Thursday outlining the next steps to demobilize the FARC now that the agreement had been ratified. The two sides have said in coming weeks the rebels will leave their camps, relocating to a set number of sites throughout the country. From there, the groups will disarm under the watch of United Nations inspectors and then begin a new life as civilians."
6309,24541,Italian Monastery Seeks Salvation in Beer After Devastating Quake - The NY Times,NY Times,Elisabetta Povoledo,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"NORCIA, Italy  —   The Rev. Cassian Folsom was preparing to celebrate morning Mass one recent Sunday when suddenly the earth started trembling. “Stones and roof tiles started raining down on our heads,” he recalled. “It was a terrifying experience. ” When the dust settled, he and the other monks  —   almost all of them transplanted from the USA  —   found their beloved Basilica of St. Benedict, built centuries ago in Norcia in the central Italian mountains to mark its namesake's birthplace, in ruins. After the Oct. 30 quake, one of the few things left standing at the monastery was a small brewery, where for the past four years the monks have been making Nursia, a beer named for Norcia's ancient Latin appellation. Their brew may now be the salvation  —   symbolically, at least  —   not only of the monks' sanctuary, but also of Norcia itself. This ancient walled city is a ghost town of ravaged churches and cracked palazzi, and is still struggling to recover from the strongest earthquake to strike Italy in 36 years. “Remarkably, the brewery was hardly damaged,” the Rev. Benedict Nivakoff, who is from Connecticut, said during a chilly morning walk through the devastated town center. “The fermenters were loosed, but they're tall and heavy, and so they didn't fall. ” The monks are planning to move the beer from the brewery to a safer location, where it can be bottled and specially labeled before it is sold to raise money for reconstruction, Father Nivakoff said. The monks set up a website for their   efforts after the basilica and monastery had been weakened by earthquakes and aftershocks in August. “The campaign started then  —   now we need to add a few more zeros,” said Father Nivakoff, the prior of the monastery. It is not be the first time the monastery has had to revive itself. The American monks arrived in 2000, under a plan by their order, the local archbishop, residents and town officials to populate a priory that had been abandoned since 1810, when Napoleon suppressed monastic orders here. Led by Father Folsom, who is the prior emeritus, the monks now number 15. They learned   from experienced Trappist brewmasters in Belgium, and began to make Nursia in 2012. The beer's name was chosen “specifically to help the townspeople, rather than naming it after St. Benedict,” Father Nivakoff said. “We wanted people to identify the beer with the town,” and to help support it, he added. Brother Augustine Wilmeth, who was born in South Carolina and serves as the brewmaster, said Nursia was “the only monastic beer in the world that is made exclusively by the monks. ” Other monastic brewing operations, he explained, have grown into   enterprises with many workers. In Norcia, the monks do everything themselves, producing around 10, 000 bottles each month. The monks, in the tradition of St. Benedict, who believed they should live and support themselves by the work of their hands, intend to keep the brewery small. That way, Brother Wilmeth said, “it will stay in our control and really serve monastic life, not overwhelm and consume us. ” The monastery's beer varieties quickly gained an enthusiastic following in local shops and restaurants, and the brewery began exporting to the USA this year. If many of the regional venues that sold the beer are shuttered because of the earthquake, it is still available through American importers, the monks said. St. Benedict, whom Pope Paul VI named a patron saint of Europe in 1964, and his twin sister, Scholastica, who also later became a saint, were born in Norcia around 480, and the remains of what some believe to be their house were once visible beneath the basilica. Benedict founded several monastic communities, including one at Monte Cassino, where he died in 543. His Rule of St. Benedict, a series of teachings for monks, formed the basic precepts for thousands of monasteries in Europe. “We have tried to help the townspeople to dig deeper and discover an identity that goes beyond prosciutto and truffles,” said Father Nivakoff, referring to two of the things the Umbrian city is known for. “I think in the last 15 years we've managed to do that. ” Mayor Nicola Alemanno said, “With this community of American monks, the value that St. Benedict has for Europe assumes a global significance,” adding: “They have become a spiritual and cultural point of reference first for the city, then for Umbria and then for Italy. ” The monks' message also achieved global recognition in 2015 when “Benedicta,” an album of traditional Latin Marian chants, spent 19 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's classical chart. Singing, Father Folsom explained, “is our spiritual nourishment  —   that's where the spiritual energy comes from. ” He added that the monks chanted for about six hours each day. “It's very much a part of our lives,” the Rev. Basil Nixen, the monastery's choirmaster, said. Before the earthquake, the muted hums of the chanting monks were familiar sounds in Norcia. The beer has also become very much a part of their lives. If   efforts can help both the sanctuary and Norcia live again, they say, the monks are happy to repay their benefactors  —   even in a small, frothy way. “We are proud that we are American,” said the Rev. Martin Bernhard, who is from Texas and is the cellarer of the monastery. “To taste and buy our beer is a beautiful thing for us. ”"
6311,24545,Howard Schultz to Step Down as Starbucks Chief Next Year - The NY Times,NY Times,Andrew Ross Sorkin,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"SEATTLE  —   Howard Schultz, the visionary leader of Starbucks, said on Thursday he would step down as chief executive next year, handing over to his personally selected successor the management of the company he built into the world's largest coffee business, with over 25, 000 stores in 75 countries. Mr. Schultz, one of the most visible chief executives in the country, has made Starbucks a vocal part of the national conversation on issues like gun violence, gay rights, race relations, veterans rights and student debt. The succession will take place on April 3, and he will remain at the company as executive chairman, focusing on the company's involvement in social causes and on growing Starbucks Reserve, the company's new superpremium brand and chain of   stores. Mr. Schultz, 63, will be succeeded by his close friend Kevin Johnson, the company's current president and a longtime Starbucks board member. “This is a big day for me,” Mr. Schultz said in an interview. “I love the company as much as I love my family. ” But he said it was the right time to hand the keys to Mr. Johnson, whom he described as being “better equipped” to “run the company than I am,” ticking off a list of Mr. Johnson's operational talents, and saying that he wanted to “relinquish the role and responsibility to the right person. ” Mr. Schultz, who could be considered the Steve Jobs of coffee, grew up poor in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn. He had a coffee epiphany while paying a client call on a coffee bean store in Seattle in 1981, and then went to work at the company the next year. In 1983, he visited Italy and was impressed not only by the ubiquity of coffee bars, but also their central role as community gathering spots  —   a role he refers to as “the third place” in society. Today, Starbucks is adding about 2, 000 new stores a year worldwide. And its legacy under Mr. Schultz's leadership includes many pioneering social and philanthropic programs: In 1988, the company introduced full health benefits for   and   employees and their domestic partners in 1991 it was the first privately owned American company to include   workers in its   program and so on, with efforts that have included the “ethical sourcing” of ingredients, a college degree program for baristas, and cups that use recycled materials. “I wanted to build the company my father never got to work for,” he said. At an   employee meeting at the company's headquarters on Thursday, Mr. Schultz was greeted with tears and a standing ovation. “For me, perhaps there are other things that are part of my destiny,” he told them. The move is likely to ignite renewed speculation about whether Mr. Schultz is paving the way to leave the company entirely to enter politics. An outspoken Democrat, Mr. Schultz has spent an increasing amount of time traveling around the country speaking publicly about the need to fix the “dysfunction in Washington. ” He has a close relationship with Obama and had been a supporter of Clinton. The company's political positions have sometimes created a backlash. During the presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump and his supporters waged war against Starbucks: In 2015, after the company redesigned its holiday cups to remove Christmas imagery, Mr. Trump suggested a boycott. This year, his supporters staged a protest called #TrumpCup in which they went to Starbucks and ordered drinks under the name Trump to get the baristas to call the name out loud. Still, Mr. Schultz said he intends for Starbucks to “maintain our moral courage. ” And he defended efforts like the company's “Race Together” campaign to spur a conversation about race relations, saying that it “was not a failure. I'd do it again. ” He said such campaigns are deeply embedded in the company's brand of “challenging the status quo about the role of a public company. ” He is excited by the question, “Since we have stores in every community in America, how can we use our scale for good?” Although the change may come as a surprise to the public and to some Starbucks employees, the company has been sending signals to Wall Street for the last year about its intentions to carry out a succession plan, announcing a reorganization in the summer that gave Mr. Johnson oversight of the    operations. Mr. Johnson, 56, spent his career in technology as a lieutenant of Steven A. Ballmer, former chief of Microsoft, and later as chief executive of Juniper Networks, before being recruited out of retirement by Mr. Schultz in 2015 to become president and chief operating officer of Starbucks. Mr. Johnson, a   operator known for his focus on building Starbucks' mobile payments systems and executing the company's global strategy, has been on a listening tour with employees over the last year. Conversations with store managers who told intimate stories about their passion and relationship with the company have been known to bring Mr. Johnson to tears. The succession plan is the second time Mr. Schultz has sought to step back from overseeing the company. He became the company's chairman in 2000 but returned as chief executive in 2008 after firing the installed chief, James Donald, as sales faltered. Upon returning to Starbucks as chief executive, Mr. Schultz increased the company's market value to $84 billion from $15 billion. In an interview on Thursday in a tasting room at Starbucks flagship Reserve Roastery in downtown Seattle, a Willy      premium coffee emporium that the company hopes to open in large cities around the world, Mr. Schultz was animated and emotional about his decision. Referring to his previous effort to step back, Mr. Schultz said: “I was not as emotionally prepared for the moment as I am now. I don't think I had the conviction  —   I was still meddling. ” “I got succession wrong the first time,” he added. Of Mr. Johnson, he said, “I'm not going to be hovering and shadowing him. ” Still, Mr. Schultz says he intends to remain a visible and active presence at the company  —   his office is connected to Mr. Johnson's  —   as he works to introduce the company's premium coffee brand with a small team that he described as the equivalent of a  . The project calls for the opening of several large emporium stores  —   one is being built in Manhattan and another in Shanghai  —   each year for the next several years, as well more than 1, 000 smaller premium stores and premium “bars” in thousands of current Starbucks stores. “Building a new brand is not unlike what Ralph Lauren did with Purple label,” Mr. Schultz said. Asked about speculation that he might be laying the groundwork to run for president, Mr. Schultz said, “I'm all in on all things Starbucks and have no plans to run for public office. ” Might he change his mind in the future? “That's the way I feel today,” he said. Mr. Johnson said that his decision to work at Starbucks came after he had rethought his career, disclosing for the first time that he had a brush with skin cancer that had led him to retire from Juniper. “It made me think,” he said. “I only want to spend time on things on which I am able to give something to people I love. ” He called his job at Starbucks a “gift” and acknowledged that he was somewhat nervous about his new role. “Can I do this?” he said he asked himself. “I'm not going to try to be Howard.

Paddock,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"BANGKOK  —   Thailand's crown prince ascended to the throne on Thursday, seven weeks after the death of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died after reigning for seven decades. In a formal ceremony at the Dusit Palace in Bangkok, the prince, crowned as King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, 64, accepted the invitation to take the throne offered by the National Assembly president. Afterward, Prime Minister Prayuth   said in a televised speech that the new monarch would be declared king retroactively to the day his father passed away. He also will be known as King Rama X of the Chakri dynasty. “The heir to the throne graciously accepted the invitation,” the prime minister said. “A kingdom should not be without a monarch on the throne. The commencement of the new reign is therefore effective as of 13 October 2016. ” The crown prince had declined to take the throne immediately after his father's death, saying he needed time to grieve. Thailand's royal succession is an elaborate process that can extend for many months. King Bhumibol's cremation will take place about a year after his death. King Vajiralongkorn's coronation will take place at some point after that. King Bhumibol was revered by many Thais who saw him as an advocate of the common people and a promoter of economic development. The official   mourning period for the public has ended, but even now many people still wear black clothing or a black ribbon to honor him. The country is sharply divided but the military, which has held power since a 2014 coup, remains firmly in control. King Bhumibol was a unifying figure and many Thais have been anxious about what kind of leadership they can expect from King Vajiralongkorn, who has lived primarily in Germany for years. “Although we all know that to be parted from the person we love and respect is suffering,” the prime minister said, “although the loss and sadness are an undeniable crisis, we should turn this crisis into an opportunity and turn grief into the strength of the land. ”"
6317,24555,"Taiwan, Italy, Joe McKnight: Your Friday Evening Briefing - The NY Times",NY Times,Karen Workman and Sandra Stevenson,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the  .) Good evening. Here's the latest. 1.   Trump spoke with the president of Taiwan, a striking break from decades of diplomatic practice that could cause a major rift with China. He was back in NY after Thursday's victory tour in Indiana and Ohio. Emotions are still raw from the campaign, evidenced during an angry debate between top strategists from the campaigns of Mr. Trump and Clinton. In Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, Mr. Trump's supporters filed legal challenges to stop recount efforts. _____ 2. Mr. Trump will inherit an unusually strong economy, with the official unemployment rate, 4. 6 percent, at its lowest level in more than nine years. Employers added 178, 000 workers in November, clearing the way for the Federal Reserve to raise the benchmark interest rate. Housing prices are up, consumer confidence is high and the American economy grew by a healthy 3. 2 percent during the third quarter. But millions of workers continue to feel the recovery has passed them by. _____ 3. We've taken a closer look at the complications Mr. Trump will face in fulfilling some of his campaign promises. On immigration, his plan to deport millions of immigrants could be stalled by courts that are already crippled by a backlog of more than 520, 000 cases. And if he follows through on punishing countries he deems guilty of unfair trade, American manufacturers who rely on imports to build their products could be hurt as well. _____ 4. A jury in Charleston  signaled that it was within a single vote of convicting a white former police officer in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man. Video of the shooting, which showed Michael Slager, above left, firing shots at Walter Scott as he fled after a traffic stop last year, rocketed into the national consciousness. “I cannot in good conscience consider a guilty verdict,” a single, unidentified juror wrote in a letter to the judge. “We may never reach a unanimous decision. ” _____ 5. A man arrested in the fatal shooting of Joe McKnight, above, a former N. F. L. player, was released without charge, sparking outrage on social media. Law enforcement officials in Louisiana, where the shooting happened on Thursday, said it might have been spurred by a “possible road rage incident” and remained under investigation. McKnight played for the NY Jets before the team cut him in 2013. _____ 6. Italy's prime minister, Matteo Renzi, may be the next leader crushed by the wave of populist anger that has upended political establishments in Europe and the U. S. Mr. Renzi has vowed to resign if voters reject a measure to overhaul the country's constitution in a referendum on Sunday. Polls indicate that the measure may fail, largely because of disillusioned young voters. In West Africa, voters in Gambia ousted a strongman who had reigned for 22 years. _____ 7. Friday marks one year since a married couple attacked public health employees in San Bernardino, Calif. killing 14 and seriously injuring 22 others. For survivors, like Amanda Gaspard, above with her parents, the long road to recovery has been complicated by repeated denials for medical care. Because the shooting was a workplace attack, a restrictive workers' compensation system is responsible for their coverage. _____ 8. A tournament that bills itself as the Super Bowl of double dutch will have its 25th anniversary on Sunday in Harlem. The schoolyard game, which was adopted and perfected by black girls in urban American communities after World War II, has fallen out of favor in the neighborhoods where it was born. But its appeal has spread abroad: Teams from France and Japan will be competing this weekend. _____ 9. For the first time in more than 100 years, the Metropolitan Opera in NY is performing a work composed by a woman. The opera, “L'Amour de Loin” (“Love From Afar”) by Kaija Saariaho, above, debuted this week with a female conductor, Susanna Malkki, as well. Ms. Malkki became only the fourth woman to take the podium in the company's history. _____ 10. Finally, let us introduce you to the participants of this year's Ms. Senior America Pageant, a celebration of women of a certain age  —   “between 60 and death,” one contestant joked. They are doctors and nurses, business owners and executives. Some have escaped wars, survived illnesses and lost loved ones. And yet, they are still kicking  —   and kicking high. There is no swimsuit competition. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers. Viewing this version of the briefing should help. Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.

6723,25071,Internal Inquiry Sealed the Fate of Roger Ailes at Fox - The NY Times,NY Times,"Jim Rutenberg, Ben Protess and Emily Steel",2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Executives at 21st Century Fox decided to end the tenure of Roger Ailes after lawyers they hired to investigate an allegation of sexual harassment against him took statements from at least six other women who described inappropriate behavior from Mr. Ailes, two people briefed on the inquiry said Wednesday. One of the people said that the details of the allegations, while unverified, were troubling enough that they left 21st Century Fox little choice but to force an end to Mr. Ailes's reign as chairman and chief executive of Fox News, given the potential liability they presented to the company both legally and in terms of its own corporate culture. The people with knowledge of the state of discussions over Mr. Ailes's exit agreement said both sides were working toward an accommodation that would recognize Mr. Ailes's service to the company as the founder and leader of Fox News, which sits atop the cable news ratings and is a major profit engine for 21st Century Fox. The agreement could also include a provision for him to continue with Fox as a consultant. But given the personalities and complications involved, the situation was fluid enough that no accommodation had been reached by Wednesday night. Fox News did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the discussions or on the investigation, which is being conducted by the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison. Lawyers for Mr. Ailes did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Ailes has denied the allegations of sexual harassment and more than a dozen Fox News staff members, including some top stars, have publicly supported him. The people briefed on the investigation, who would not speak for attribution because of the sensitivity of the investigation, stressed that it was narrowly focused on the allegations against Mr. Ailes, and not the broader climate at the network. But Mr. Ailes's departure will have much wider implications. Given Fox News's place as a central hub for conservative opinion  —   not to mention as a primary outlet for the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump  —   the shape of its   operation goes beyond corporate intrigue at 21st Century Fox, and could have consequences for the national political dialogue. In the two weeks since Gretchen Carlson, a former Fox anchor, filed suit against Mr. Ailes, the Murdoch family, which runs 21st Century Fox, has made it clear that its decision to take the allegations seriously was in keeping with its desire to follow modern standards for office conduct, and that these needed to extend to Fox News, as well. The question in the   environment is to what extent the Murdochs decide to continue on with Mr. Ailes's current management team. That, in turn, could determine the future approach and look of the network, which is the outlet of choice for   viewers seeking an alternative to the mainstream media. Speculation about who Mr. Ailes's successor would be transfixed the media world on Wednesday, with focus on outsiders such as the CBS News president, David Rhodes, who had worked at Fox News for several years one of Mr. Ailes's current lieutenants, like Bill Shine or Michael Clemente the NY Post chief executive Jesse Angelo or someone from conservative media like Christopher Ruddy, the founder and chief executive of Newsmax Media Inc. At least for the day, fears that some of Fox News's   stars, like Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity and Greta Van Susteren, would exercise contract clauses to leave with Mr. Ailes's loss of his chairmanship, appeared to abate. Network staff members were acutely focused on Megyn Kelly, who had hinted in recent months she wanted to leave the network. She was one of the women who told Paul, Weiss investigators that Mr. Ailes had acted improperly with her, one of the people briefed on the inquiry said Tuesday. Ms. Kelly maintained her silence on Wednesday. But as the end of Mr. Ailes's chairmanship approached, it appeared to embolden other women to discuss their own experiences at the network. Several spoke with reporters on condition that they not be named. In interviews, several current and former Fox News employees said inappropriate comments about a woman's appearance and her sex life were frequent in the newsroom. The newsroom has been on edge in the weeks since Ms. Carlson filed her suit, one person said. Everybody wants to talk about the drama but nobody wants to talk in the open, the person said. As of Wednesday evening, staff members had not received an email from 21st Century Fox, Fox News or Mr. Ailes informing them about the events that have transpired, the investigation or the future of the network. The swift pace of events at Fox News  —   only two weeks passed between Ms. Carlson's filing of her lawsuit and the negotiations to end Mr. Ailes's leadership  —   were especially surprising for a network that has made its name by embracing “politically incorrect” themes, something in keeping with the brash personalities of both Mr. Ailes and the 21st Century Fox patriarch, Rupert Murdoch. Female hosts in skirts, sitting behind translucent desks that can highlight their legs, have always been a network trademark. To completely move away from that ethos would be to fundamentally change the network. And 21st Century Fox's leadership will have to be mindful of maintaining its special relationship with viewers that Mr. Ailes has so carefully cultivated, and which is central to the financial and ratings success of the network. Mr. Murdoch will ultimately determine that direction in close consultation  —   and perhaps even some deference  —   to the two sons he is grooming to succeed him, Lachlan and James Murdoch. The latter, at least, is known to have different politics from his father. So far, none of the three has made any public statement about the network, its future or, for that matter, Mr. Ailes."
6830,25225,Dilma Rousseff Is Ousted as Brazil's President in Impeachment Vote - The NY Times,NY Times,Simon Romero,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"BRASÍLIA  —   The Senate on Wednesday impeached Dilma Rousseff, Brazil's first female president, and removed her from office for the rest of her term, the capstone of a power struggle that has consumed the nation for months and toppled one of the hemisphere's most powerful political parties. The Senate voted 61 to 20 to convict Ms. Rousseff on charges of manipulating the federal budget in an effort to conceal the nation's mounting economic problems. But the final removal of Ms. Rousseff, who was suspended in May to face trial, was much more than a judgment of guilt on any charge. It was a verdict on her leadership and the slipping fortunes of Latin America's largest country. The impeachment puts a definitive end to 13 years  of governing by the leftist Workers' Party, an era during which Brazil's economy boomed, lifting millions into the middle class and raising the country's profile on the global stage. But sweeping corruption scandals, the worst economic crisis in decades and the government's   responses to the souring national mood opened Ms. Rousseff to withering scorn, leaving her with little support to fend off a power grab by her political rivals. “She lacked it all,” said Mentor Muniz Neto, a writer from São Paulo who described Ms. Rousseff's final ouster as a “death foretold,” asserting that she lacked charisma, competence and humility. “We deserved better. ” To her many critics, the impeachment was a fitting fall for an arrogant leader at the helm of a political movement that had lost its way. But Ms. Rousseff and her supporters call her ouster a coup that undermines Brazil's young democracy. Moreover, her impeachment may not restore public confidence in Brazil's leaders, or diminish the corruption that pervades the country's politics. To the contrary, many Brazilians note, it transfers power from one   party to another. Michel Temer, 75, the interim president who served as Ms. Rousseff's vice president before breaking with her this year, is now expected to remain in office until the end of the current term in 2018. But Mr. Temer's centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, which anchored the Workers' Party's governing coalition for more than a decade, was also deeply enmeshed in the colossal graft schemes staining Brazil's political system in recent years. It arguably benefited as much as the Workers' Party from huge bribes and illicit campaign financing. Since becoming interim president in May, Mr. Temer has had approval ratings nearly as dismal as Ms. Rousseff's. Shifting the government to the right, he named a cabinet without any female or   ministers, outraging many in a country where nearly 51 percent of people define themselves as black or mixed race, according to the 2010 census. Several of the men named by Mr. Temer have already resigned under the cloud of scandal, including his anticorruption minister and his planning minister, amid claims that they were trying to stymie investigations into the bribery scandals engulfing the national oil company, Petrobras. Mr. Temer was recently found guilty of violating campaign finance limits, a conviction that could make him ineligible to run for office for eight years. Beyond that, a construction executive has testified that Mr. Temer was the beneficiary of a $300, 000 bribe, an assertion Mr. Temer disputes. The impeachment effort has divided the nation and stirred passions on both sides. Of the four Brazilian presidents elected since Brazil's democracy was   in the 1980s, Ms. Rousseff is the second to be forced from office through the impeachment process. In 1992, Fernando Collor de Mello resigned before the Senate could convict him on corruption charges. (Under Brazilian law, a president is not impeached until he or she is convicted by the Senate, legal scholars say.) “It's painfully obvious that Temer is a slap in the face to Brazilian democracy,” said Creuza Maria Oliveira, the president of the National Federation of Domestic Workers, which represents millions of maids who benefited from the strengthening of labor laws by Ms. Rousseff. “Dilma is a champion of the poor,” said Ms. Oliveira, who was among the supporters of Ms. Rousseff who accompanied her to the Senate this week. “Temer is a champion of his own political class, which he wants to shield from justice. ” Some prominent business and political figures in Brazil counter that Mr. Temer, a former speaker in the lower house, has the political skills needed to muster support in a fractious, discredited Congress for ambitious measures aimed at increasing investment in the economy and easing a major pension crisis. Mr. Temer's administration has “all the conditions needed to embark on a new route,” Philipp Schiemer, the head of  's operations in Brazil, told reporters in recent days. “We need to decide if we want a Brazil like Venezuela or a Brazil inserted in the new world. ” Still others, including Ms. Rousseff, contend that the ease with which the political elite shunted aside the president will bring more divisiveness and political tumult in Brazil. “This is serious because other presidents of the republic will have to deal with this,” Ms. Rousseff said this week in her testimony in the Senate, comparing her ouster to the coups toppling Brazilian leaders throughout much of the 20th century. “If that isn't political instability, then I don't know what is. ” Unlike many of the politicians who led the charge to oust her, Ms. Rousseff, 68, remains a rare breed in Brazil: a prominent leader who has not been accused of illegally enriching herself. Instead, her trial revolved around a contentious legal question of whether she committed an impeachable offense by employing budgetary tricks to conceal yawning deficits. Ms. Rousseff repeatedly insisted that she did nothing illegal, pointing out that her predecessors also manipulated the federal budget. But her opponents argued that the scale of her administration's transfers of funds between giant public banks, to the tune of about $11 billion, seriously eroded Brazil's economic credibility and helped her get   unfairly in 2014. Ms. Rousseff will not go to jail after her conviction, but she expressed defiance throughout her trial, insisting that Brazil's economic crisis was largely the result of shifts in the global economy that cut commodities prices. A bureaucrat who specialized in overseeing giant public companies in Brazil's energy industry, Ms. Rousseff had not held elected office until her predecessor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, anointed her as his heir after other leaders in the Workers' Party were tarnished by a   scandal. As a divorced grandmother known as an avid reader of literature, she was an exception in the   political scene. In addition to serving as Mr. da Silva's   chief of staff, she was known for her involvement with the Palmares Armed Revolutionary Vanguard, an urban guerrilla group, in her youth. Agents of the military dictatorship captured Ms. Rousseff and tortured her repeatedly in the early 1970s. But the qualities that made her a compelling chief of staff did not carry over when she became president. Her autocratic persona and short temper became legendary in Brasília, a capital where   deals are customary when forging and nurturing alliances with an array of bickering parties. Many voters also felt betrayed after Ms. Rousseff's   campaign, when she narrowly won on promises to maintain extensive state control over the economy, resulting in generous public spending. But once   she went in another direction, appointing a finance minister who tried to win approval for   policies. “She simply lied through her teeth to get   forming a wave of national indignation,” said Antonio Risério, a historian and cultural commentator. “Upon perceiving that they voted for one person and elected another, the majority of the population started to want her head. ” With Ms. Rousseff deposed, the Workers' Party, a dominant force in Brazilian politics for much of the past decade and a half, is now scrambling to find its way in a political landscape where conservative voices are growing more powerful. João Santana, the party's campaign strategist who helped Ms. Rousseff win two presidential elections, faces charges of illegally receiving millions of dollars in offshore accounts from the bribery scheme involving the national oil company. Even more damaging for the party, federal investigators are seeking graft charges against Mr. da Silva, the former labor leader universally known as Lula, who was president from 2003 to 2010. The move adds to mounting legal problems faced by Mr. da Silva, who is still signaling that he plans to run for president in 2018. Ms. Rousseff found herself increasingly isolated in recent months, with many in her party quietly withdrawing their support. But senators offered her a morsel of consolation by voting to allow her to run for public office, overruling an effort to make her ineligible from doing so for several years. And some in Ms. Rousseff's party defended her as she made her   effort before the Senate this week. “You veered from the narrative when you were elected president of the republic as a woman, from the left, a former militant against the dictatorship, without a husband to pose by your side in the photographs,” said Regina Sousa, a Workers' Party senator from Piauí in northeast Brazil. “You never fit in the cute little dress designed by the conservative elite of this country,” Ms. Sousa added. Heated tempers marked the trial in the Senate. Crying as she spoke, Janaína Paschoal, the law professor who was an author of the impeachment request, said she had been inspired by God and that she was seeking impeachment for the good of Ms. Rousseff's grandchildren. Ms. Rousseff's lawyer, José Eduardo Cardozo, said he was stunned that her opponents had dragged Ms. Rousseff's family into the acerbic debate, pointing out that Ms. Rousseff was never accused of embezzling public funds to benefit her family. “If you want to condemn her, go ahead, but don't mock the honor of a dignified woman,” said Mr. Cardozo, also crying as he spoke."
6831,25226,"Yesterday, Outraged by Apple's Tax Dodge. Today, by Its Tax Bill. - The NY Times",NY Times,Alan Rappeport,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   American lawmakers have for years been assailing companies for dodging taxes with overseas maneuvers. But now that the EU has done something about it by trying to wrest billions of dollars from Apple, those officials have offered a response viewed by many as rife with hypocrisy: collective outrage. Tax avoidance has become a lightning rod as the presidential campaign has taken on a strong populist cast, and leading Republicans and Democrats in Congress have demanded that companies be forced to pay their fair share. Both Clinton and Donald J. Trump have vowed to crack down on deals that allow companies to relocate their headquarters overseas to lower their tax bills, and the Treasury Department has made limiting international loopholes a priority. Despite all that, Apple  —   a company long accused of being overly creative at avoiding taxes  —   now has the federal government standing up for it after the EU's executive commission ordered Ireland on Tuesday to collect $14. 5 billion in taxes from the company. And for at least some American politicians, the anger stems from a simple calculation: The tax money that the EU extracts from Apple should be going to the USA Treasury, not that they have figured out how to make that happen. “It's remarkable to think that the administration has been flying over to Brussels on taxpayers' dollars to lobby the EU against collecting taxes owed in Europe when they're not collecting the taxes owed here,” said Clark Gascoigne, deputy director of the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency Coalition. “It's terribly ironic. ” Most lawmakers and business groups do not see it that way. They defended Apple by arguing that the EU was overstepping its authority and reinterpreting international tax law to unfairly penalize the company. Some called it a new brand of protectionism. The Treasury Department said the ruling was “deeply troubling. ” The Business Roundtable, a lobbying organization for America's largest companies, called the move a “reckless and dramatic overreach” and an “act of aggression” against a company and a sovereign government. In Congress, lawmakers in both parties have urged the Treasury Department to be tougher on European officials as they aggressively investigate what they call undue tax benefits given by member nations to leading American companies. Members of the Senate Finance Committee sent a letter in May to Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, urging him to consider retaliation that would include doubling taxes on companies and individuals in Europe. The European Commission “is using a theory to make tax law, is doing it in a way that is retroactive and that overrides national tax law authority, in our view,” Mr. Lew said Wednesday at a Brookings Institution event previewing this weekend's meeting in China of the Group of 20 largest industrial economies. He pushed back against the idea that Treasury is condoning tax evasion, saying legislation that prevents companies from parking income overseas to avoid being taxed in the USA “will see action probably not in my tenure but early in the next administration. ” The European Commission's ruling has even managed to forge a rare moment of agreement between the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, and Senator Chuck Schumer, a NY Democrat who is likely to become the next leader of his party in the Senate. “This decision is awful,” Mr. Ryan said in a statement. “Slamming a company with a giant tax bill  —   years after the fact  —   sends exactly the wrong message to job creators on both sides of the Atlantic. ” Mr. Schumer said in an interview that he and Mr. Ryan had been discussing possibilities for a corporate tax overhaul for next year. He said he was optimistic about the prospect of requiring corporate money to return to the USA at a lower tax rate, with some of the proceeds being used to fund a large investment in infrastructure. The action taken by the EU, he said, should be an impetus to get moving on such legislation. “The EU is going to grab this money, instead of the U. S.,” Mr. Schumer said. “It's a big signpost here for us. Let's get moving. ” He added: “We're trying to protect our U. S. tax base. That money sitting over there should be here in the U. S. not in Ireland and not in the EU” The bipartisan “consensus” that the corporate tax rate should be cut in exchange for loopholes closures emerged in Obama's first term, yet Congress has not formally drafted a bill, much less voted on one. Tax experts said that without a deep cut in the tax rate, companies like Apple would be better off paying back taxes in Europe than repatriating their overseas cash. “This is not taking 13 billion euros out of the U. S. Treasury's pocket and U. S. taxpayers' pocket and putting it into Europe,” said Jeffery M. Kadet, a tax lecturer at the University of Washington School of Law. “They wouldn't be bringing this money back to the U. S. anyway. ” Reuven S.   who directs the international taxation program at the University of Michigan Law School, said that the EU had a strong case for collecting the taxes from Apple and that if the situation were reversed, Americans would be clamoring to collect taxes from a foreign company. “Just because it happens to be an American company, to say that the EU should not take action, I think, is the height of hypocrisy,” Mr.   said. While most lawmakers condemned the treatment of Apple, one prominent former senator said he was pleased to see Europe take action. Carl M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who was chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations when it examined Apple's use of tax havens in 2013, said the European Commission should fill the vacuum left by lackadaisical tax enforcement in the USA. “The royalties Apple collects for its overseas sales of products designed and developed in the U. S. should be taxed in the U. S.,” Mr. Levin said. “But Apple has avoided the billions of dollars of taxes it owes the U. S. by transferring its intellectual property to itself in Ireland. ” Blaming Apple and the Internal Revenue Service, he added, “When Apple used those tax avoidance schemes, it is understandable that Europe would try to go after them. ” It remains to be seen if corporate tax reform will be a priority for the next administration, but the language used by both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump on the campaign trail suggests that it is a strong possibility. Mrs. Clinton has released a formal proposal to prevent   corporate inversions and to reward companies that keep their operations in the USA. Mr. Trump, who has called for a boycott of Apple products, has threatened to punish companies that relocate to other countries by imposing taxes on products they sell in the USA. The news that a corporate giant might have evaded billions of dollars in taxes could become another populist rallying cry. “There's a reason Trump and Bernie Sanders did so well in the campaign this year,” Mr. Gascoigne, of the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency Coalition, said. “People are fed up with the kinds of   deals that are happening at the large multinational companies at the expense of the American people. ”"
6832,25227,How to Win Friends and Influence People (on Fake Mars) - The NY Times,NY Times,Katie Rogers,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Amid the craggy landscape near the Mauna Loa volcano on Hawaii, six researchers lived for a year as if they were on Mars. Confined to a    habitat inside and spacesuits outside, the researchers spent their time extracting water from dry rock, growing plants and crawling through gigantic lava tubes. But when members of the group were released from their habitat on Sunday, they emphasized one key takeaway: They had spent a lot of time trying not to drive themselves or each other crazy. Two significant obstacles for the researchers were the physical and the emotional isolation. They began living at the habitat in August 2015 as part of the     project. They were the fourth group to take up residence there, and stayed longer than any previous group. Experts say that travel to Mars may be possible by the 2030s, so if you're among the many who hope to one day complete the approximately    journey to the red planet  —   or if you want to try your hand at a year living in   isolation  —   here are a few tips on how to get along with your colleagues at one of the most extreme workplaces in the solar system. People who are not working on Mars or in a   environment usually do not have this luxury, but according to Christiane Heinicke, a    German physicist and engineer, democracy was a part of the personnel process on fake Mars. “During the selection process, we were trekking together in the Rocky Mountains,” Dr. Heinicke said in an email. “Afterwards, everyone voted anonymously for their preferred commander, which turned out to be Carmel,” as in Carmel Johnston, a soil scientist from Montana. Nobody wants to hear the words “emergency” and “Mars” in the same sentence, but in this case, a glitch in the workday helped temporarily repair group relations. “It really helps to have an emergency to work on together, because it reunites the group,” Dr. Heinicke told journalists after her group was released. “And everybody has new motivation to work together and make it through the whole year. ” During their time in the habitat, the researchers had only small spaces to themselves, including a bed, a desk and some storage space. Aside from making sure you bring “good music” to drown out your colleagues' noise in close quarters, it will help to nurture your own side projects and hobbies, Ms. Heinicke said. “Bring a lot of meaningful, stimulating projects to work, and be open to collaborate with others,” she said. “More generally: Be adaptable the mission is very unlikely to be fully predictable. ” Her colleague, Cyprien Verseux, echoed that sentiment: “Bring books,” he told journalists after he was released. If all else fails, start a band, make finger puppets, exercise or even do your taxes to pass the time. This one is a universal truth on Earth as well as on Mars, but in the habitat, there were fewer opportunities to escape one another. Mr. Verseux said that “monotony, always in the same place, always with the same people” were among his biggest challenges while living in the domed research lab that the group called home, where the only respite from the cabin  —   going outside  —   required wearing a mock spacesuit. Another key takeaway from the mission, Ms. Heinicke said, is that not everyone is built to live in an extreme environment and in   isolation. “Some thrive and ‘infect' each other with ideas and work on a large number of joint projects,” she said. “The others decay and progressively slip into a worse and worse mood. Obviously, if you want to send humans to Mars, you have to make sure your crew is composed of only the first kind. ”"
7063,25552,"Fidel Castro, Cuban Revolutionary Who Defied U.S., Dies at 90 - The NY Times",NY Times,Anthony DePalma,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Fidel Castro, the fiery apostle of revolution who brought the Cold War to the Western Hemisphere in 1959 and then defied the USA for nearly half a century as Cuba's maximum leader, bedeviling 11 American presidents and briefly pushing the world to the brink of nuclear war, died on Friday. He was 90. Cuban state television announced the death but gave no other details. In declining health for several years, Mr. Castro had orchestrated what he hoped would be the continuation of his Communist revolution, stepping aside in 2006 when a serious illness felled him. He provisionally ceded much of his power to his younger brother Raúl, now 85, and two years later formally resigned as president. Raúl Castro, who had fought alongside Fidel Castro from the earliest days of the insurrection and remained minister of defense and his brother's closest confidant, has ruled Cuba since then, although he has told the Cuban people he intends to resign in 2018. Fidel Castro had held on to power longer than any other living national leader except Queen Elizabeth II. He became a towering international figure whose importance in the 20th century far exceeded what might have been expected from the head of state of a Caribbean island nation of 11 million people. He dominated his country with strength and symbolism from the day he triumphantly entered Havana on Jan. 8, 1959, and completed his overthrow of Fulgencio Batista by delivering his first major speech in the capital before tens of thousands of admirers at the vanquished dictator's military headquarters. A spotlight shone on him as he swaggered and spoke with passion until dawn. Finally, white doves were released to signal Cuba's new peace. When one landed on Mr. Castro, perching on a shoulder, the crowd erupted, chanting: “Fidel! Fidel!” To the   Cubans gathered there and those watching on television, it was an electrifying sign that their young, bearded guerrilla leader was destined to be their savior. Most people in the crowd had no idea what Mr. Castro planned for Cuba. A master of image and myth, Mr. Castro believed himself to be the messiah of his fatherland, an indispensable force with authority from on high to control Cuba and its people. He wielded power like a tyrant, controlling every aspect of the island's existence. He was Cuba's “Máximo Lider. ” From atop a Cuban Army tank, he directed his country's defense at the Bay of Pigs. Countless details fell to him, from selecting the color of uniforms that Cuban soldiers wore in Angola to overseeing a program to produce a superbreed of milk cows. He personally set the goals for sugar harvests. He personally sent countless men to prison. But it was more than repression and fear that kept him and his totalitarian government in power for so long. He had both admirers and detractors in Cuba and around the world. Some saw him as a ruthless despot who trampled rights and freedoms many others hailed him as the crowds did that first night, as a revolutionary hero for the ages. Even when he fell ill and was hospitalized with diverticulitis in the summer of 2006, giving up most of his powers for the first time, Mr. Castro tried to dictate the details of his own medical care and orchestrate the continuation of his Communist revolution, engaging a plan as old as the revolution itself. By handing power to his brother, Mr. Castro once more raised the ire of his enemies in Washington. USA officials condemned the transition, saying it prolonged a dictatorship and again denied the   Cuban people a chance to control their own lives. But in December 2014, Obama used his executive powers to dial down the decades of antagonism between Washington and Havana by moving to exchange prisoners and normalize diplomatic relations between the two countries, a deal worked out with the help of Pope Francis and after 18 months of secret talks between representatives of both governments. Though increasingly frail and rarely seen in public, Mr. Castro even then made clear his enduring mistrust of the USA. A few days after Mr. Obama's highly publicized visit to Cuba in 2016  —   the first by a sitting American president in 88 years  —   Mr. Castro penned a cranky response denigrating Mr. Obama's overtures of peace and insisting that Cuba did not need anything the USA was offering. To many, Fidel Castro was a   zealot whose belief in his own destiny was unshakable, a chameleon whose economic and political colors were determined more by pragmatism than by doctrine. But in his chest beat the heart of a true rebel. “Fidel Castro,” said Henry M. Wriston, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations in the 1950s and early '60s, “was everything a revolutionary should be. ” Mr. Castro was perhaps the most important leader to emerge from Latin America since the wars of independence in the early 19th century. He was decidedly the most influential shaper of Cuban history since his own hero, José Martí, struggled for Cuban independence in the late 19th century. Mr. Castro's revolution transformed Cuban society and had a   impact throughout the region than that of any other   Latin American insurrection, with the possible exception of the 1910 Mexican Revolution. His legacy in Cuba and elsewhere has been a mixed record of social progress and abject poverty, of racial equality and political persecution, of medical advances and a degree of misery comparable to the conditions that existed in Cuba when he entered Havana as a victorious guerrilla commander in 1959. That image made him a symbol of revolution throughout the world and an inspiration to many imitators. Hugo Chávez of Venezuela considered Mr. Castro his ideological godfather. Subcommander Marcos began a revolt in the mountains of southern Mexico in 1994, using many of the same tactics. Even Mr. Castro's spotty performance as an aging autocrat in charge of a foundering economy could not undermine his image. But beyond anything else, it was Mr. Castro's obsession with the USA, and America's obsession with him, that shaped his rule. After he embraced Communism, Washington portrayed him as a devil and a tyrant and repeatedly tried to remove him from power through an   invasion at the Bay of Pigs in 1961, an economic embargo that has lasted decades, assassination plots and even bizarre plans to undercut his prestige by making his beard fall out. Mr. Castro's defiance of American power made him a beacon of resistance in Latin America and elsewhere, and his bushy beard, long Cuban cigar and green fatigues became universal symbols of rebellion. Mr. Castro's understanding of the power of images, especially on television, helped him retain the loyalty of many Cubans even during the harshest periods of deprivation and isolation when he routinely blamed America and its embargo for many of Cuba's ills. And his mastery of words in thousands of speeches, often lasting hours, imbued many Cubans with his own hatred of the USA by keeping them on constant watch for an invasion  —   military, economic or ideological  —   from the north. Over many years Mr. Castro gave hundreds of interviews and retained the ability to twist the most compromising question to his favor. In a 1985 interview in Playboy magazine, he was asked how he would respond to President Ronald Reagan's description of him as a ruthless military dictator. “Let's think about your question,” Mr. Castro said, toying with his interviewer. “If being a dictator means governing by decree, then you might use that argument to accuse the pope of being a dictator. ” He turned the question back on Reagan: “If his power includes something as monstrously undemocratic as the ability to order a thermonuclear war, I ask you, who then is more of a dictator, the president of the USA or I?” After leading his guerrillas against a repressive Cuban dictator, Mr. Castro, in his early 30s, aligned Cuba with the Soviet Union and used Cuban troops to support revolution in Africa and throughout Latin America. His willingness to allow the Soviets to build   sites in Cuba led to a harrowing diplomatic standoff between the USA and the Soviet Union in the fall of 1962, one that could have escalated into a nuclear exchange. The world remained tense until the confrontation was defused 13 days after it began, and the launching pads were dismantled. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Mr. Castro faced one of his biggest challenges: surviving without huge Communist subsidies. He defied predictions of his political demise. When threatened, he fanned antagonism toward the USA. And when the Cuban economy neared collapse, he legalized the USA dollar, which he had railed against since the 1950s, only to ban dollars again a few years later when the economy stabilized. Mr. Castro continued to taunt American presidents for a   frustrating all of Washington's attempts to contain him. After nearly five decades as a pariah of the West, even when his once booming voice had withered to an old man's whisper and his beard had turned gray, he remained defiant. He often told interviewers that he identified with Don Quixote, and like Quixote he struggled against threats both real and imagined, preparing for decades, for example, for another invasion that never came. As the leaders of every other nation of the hemisphere gathered in Quebec City in April 2001 for the third Summit of the Americas, an uninvited Mr. Castro, then 74, fumed in Havana, presiding over ceremonies commemorating the embarrassing defeat of C. I. A.  exiles at the Bay of Pigs in 1961. True to character, he portrayed his exclusion as a sign of strength, declaring that Cuba “is the only country in the world that does not need to trade with the USA. ” Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz was born on Aug. 13, 1926  —   1927 in some reports  —   in what was then the eastern Cuban province of Oriente, the son of a plantation owner, Ángel Castro, and one of his maids, Lina Ruz González, who became his second wife and had seven children. The father was a Spaniard who had arrived in Cuba under mysterious circumstances. One account, supported by Mr. Castro himself, was that his father had agreed to take the place of a Spanish aristocrat who had been drafted into the Spanish Army in the late 19th century to fight against Cuban independence and American hegemony. Other versions suggest that Ángel Castro went penniless to Cuba but eventually established a plantation and did business with the despised,   United Fruit Company. By the time Fidel was a youngster, his father was a major landholder. Fidel was a boisterous young student who was sent away to study with the Jesuits at the Colegio de Dolores in Santiago de Cuba and later to the Colegio de Belén, an exclusive Jesuit high school in Havana. Cuban lore has it that he was headstrong and fanatical even as a boy. In one account, Fidel was said to have bicycled   into a wall to make a point to his friends about the strength of his will. In another   tale, young Fidel and his class were led on a mountain hike by a priest. The priest slipped in a   stream and was in danger of drowning until Fidel pulled him to shore, then both knelt in prayers of thanks for their good fortune. A sense of destiny accompanied Mr. Castro as he entered the University of Havana's law school in 1945 and almost immediately immersed himself in radical politics. He took part in an invasion of the Dominican Republic that unsuccessfully tried to oust the dictator Rafael Trujillo. He became increasingly obsessed with Cuban politics and led student protests and demonstrations even when he was not enrolled in the university. Mr. Castro's university days earned him the image of   and seemed to support the view that he had had Communist leanings all along. But in an interview in 1981, quoted in Tad Szulc's 1986 biography, “Fidel,” Mr. Castro said that he had flirted with Communist ideas but did not join the party. “I had entered into contact with Marxist literature,” Mr. Castro said. “At that time, there were some Communist students at the University of Havana, and I had friendly relations with them, but I was not in the Socialist Youth, I was not a militant in the Communist Party. ” He acknowledged that radical philosophy had influenced his character: “I was then acquiring a revolutionary conscience I was active I struggled, but let us say I was an independent fighter. ” After receiving his law degree, Mr. Castro briefly represented the poor, often bartering his services for food. In 1952, he ran for Congress as a candidate for the opposition Orthodox Party. But the election was scuttled because of a coup staged by Mr. Batista. Mr. Castro's initial response to the Batista government was to challenge it with a legal appeal, claiming that Mr. Batista's actions had violated the Constitution. Even as a symbolic act, the attempt was futile. His core group of radical students gained followers, and on July 26, 1953, Mr. Castro led them in an attack on the Moncada barracks in Santiago de Cuba. Many of the rebels were killed. The others were captured, as were Mr. Castro and his brother Raúl. At his trial, Mr. Castro defended the attack. Mr. Batista had issued an order not to discuss the proceedings, but six Cuban journalists who had been allowed in the courtroom recorded Mr. Castro's defense. “As for me, I know that jail will be as hard as it has ever been for anyone, filled with threats, with vileness and cowardly brutality,” Mr. Castro declared. “I do not fear this, as I do not fear the fury of the miserable tyrant who snuffed out the life of 70 brothers of mine. Condemn me, it does not matter. History will absolve me. ” Mr. Castro was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Mr. Batista then made what turned out to be a huge strategic error. Believing that the rebels' energy had been spent, and under pressure from civic leaders to show that he was not a dictator, he released Mr. Castro and his followers in an amnesty after the 1954 presidential election. Mr. Castro went into exile in Mexico, where he plotted his return to Cuba. He tried to buy a used American PT boat to carry his band to Cuba, but the deal fell through. Then he caught sight of a     wooden yacht named Granma, once owned by an American who lived in Mexico City. The Granma remains on display in Havana, encased in glass. During Mr. Castro's long rule, his character and image underwent several transformations, beginning with his days as a revolutionary in the Sierra Maestra of eastern Cuba. After arriving on the coast in the overloaded yacht with Che Guevara and 80 of their comrades in December 1956, Mr. Castro took on the role of freedom fighter. He engaged in a campaign of harassment and guerrilla warfare that infuriated Mr. Batista, who had seized power in a 1952 garrison revolt, ending a brief period of democracy. Although his soldiers and weapons vastly outnumbered Mr. Castro's, Mr. Batista grew fearful of the young guerrilla's mesmerizing oratory. He ordered government troops not to rest until they had killed Mr. Castro, and the army frequently reported that it had done so. Newspapers around the world reported his death in the December 1956 landing. But three months later, Mr. Castro was interviewed for a series of articles that would revive his movement and thus change history. The escapade began when Castro loyalists contacted a correspondent and editorial writer for The NY Times, Herbert L. Matthews, and arranged for him to interview Mr. Castro. A few Castro supporters took Mr. Matthews into the mountains disguised as a wealthy American planter. Drawing on his reporting, Mr. Matthews wrote sympathetically of both the man and his movement, describing Mr. Castro, then 30, parting the jungle leaves and striding into a clearing for the interview. “This was quite a man  —   a powerful       with a straggly beard,” Mr. Matthews wrote. The three articles, which began in The Times on Sunday, Feb. 24, 1957, presented a Castro that Americans could root for. “The personality of the man is overpowering,” Mr. Matthews wrote. “Here was an educated, dedicated fanatic, a man of ideals, of courage and of remarkable qualities of leadership. ” The articles repeated Mr. Castro's assertions that Cuba's future was anything but a Communist state. “He has strong ideas of liberty, democracy, social justice, the need to restore the Constitution, to hold elections,” Mr. Matthews wrote. When asked about the USA, Mr. Castro replied, “You can be sure we have no animosity toward the USA and the American people. ” The Cuban government denounced Mr. Matthews and called the articles fabrications. But the news that he had survived the landing breathed life into Mr. Castro's movement. His small band of irregulars skirmished with government troops, and each encounter increased their support in Cuba and around the world, even though other insurgent forces in the cities were also fighting to overthrow the Batista government. It was the symbolic strength of his movement, not the armaments under Mr. Castro's control, that overwhelmed the government. By the time Mr. Batista fled from a darkened Havana airport just after midnight on New Year's Day 1959, Mr. Castro was already a legend. Competing opposition groups were unable to seize power. Events over the next few months became the catalyst for another transformation in Mr. Castro's public image. More than 500   officials were brought before   and special tribunals, summarily convicted and shot to death. The grainy    images of the executions broadcast on American television horrified viewers. Mr. Castro defended the executions as necessary to solidify the revolution. He complained that the USA had raised not a whimper when Mr. Batista had tortured and executed thousands of opponents. But to wary observers in the USA, the executions were a signal that Mr. Castro was not the democratic savior he had seemed. In May 1959, he began confiscating privately owned agricultural land, including land owned by Americans, openly provoking the USA government. In the spring of 1960, Mr. Castro ordered American and British refineries in Cuba to accept oil from the Soviet Union. Under pressure from Congress, President Dwight D. Eisenhower cut the American sugar quota from Cuba, forcing Mr. Castro to look for new markets. He turned to the Soviet Union for economic aid and political support. Thus began a   of American antagonism toward Cuba. Finally, in 1961, he gave the USA 48 hours to reduce the staff of its embassy in Havana to 18 from 60. A frustrated Eisenhower broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba and closed the embassy on the Havana seacoast. The diplomatic stalemate lasted until 2015, when embassies were finally reopened in both Havana and Washington. During his two years in the mountains, Mr. Castro had sketched a social revolution whose aim, at least on the surface, seemed to be to restore the democracy that Mr. Batista's coup had stifled. Mr. Castro promised free elections and vowed to end American domination of the economy and the   oppression that he said it had caused. Despite having a law degree, Mr. Castro had no real experience in economics or government. Beyond improving education and reducing Cuba's dependence on sugar and the USA, his revolution began without a clear sense of the new society he planned, except that it would be different from what had existed under Mr. Batista. At the time, Cuba was a playground for rich American tourists and gangsters where glaring disparities of wealth persisted, although the country was one of the most economically advanced in the Caribbean. After taking power in 1959, Mr. Castro put together a cabinet of moderates, but it did not last long. He named Felipe Pazos, an economist, president of the Banco Nacional de Cuba, Cuba's central bank. But when Mr. Pazos openly criticized Mr. Castro's growing tolerance of Communists and his failure to restore democracy, he was dismissed. In place of Mr. Pazos, Mr. Castro named Che Guevara, an Argentine doctor who knew nothing about monetary policy but whose revolutionary credentials were unquestioned. Opposition to the Castro government began to grow in Cuba, leading peasants and   insurgents to take up arms against it. The Escambray Revolt, as it was called, lasted from 1959 to 1965, when it was crushed by Mr. Castro's army. As the first waves of Cuban exiles arrived in Miami and northern New Jersey after the revolution, many were intent on overthrowing the man they had once supported. Their number would eventually total a million, many from what had been, proportionately, the largest middle class in Latin America. The Central Intelligence Agency helped train an exile army to retake Cuba by force. The army was to make a beachhead at the Bay of Pigs, a remote spot on Cuba's southern coast, and instigate a popular insurrection. Mr. Szulc, then a correspondent for The Times, had picked up information about the invasion, and had written an article about it. But The Times, at the request of the Kennedy administration, withheld some of what Mr. Szulc had found, including information that an attack was imminent. Specific references to the C. I. A. were also omitted. Ten days later, on April 17, 1961, 1, 500 Cuban fighters landed at the Bay of Pigs. Mr. Castro was waiting for them. The invasion was badly planned and by all accounts doomed. Most of the invaders were either captured or killed. Promised American air support never arrived. The historian Theodore Draper called the botched operation “a perfect failure,” and the invasion aroused a distrust of the USA that Mr. Castro exploited for political gain for the rest of his life. The C. I. A. fighting the Cold War, had acted out of worries about Mr. Castro's increasingly open Communist connections. As he consolidated power, even some of his most faithful supporters grew concerned. One break had taken place as early as 1959. Huber Matos, who had fought alongside Mr. Castro in the Sierra Maestra, resigned as military governor of Camagüey Province to protest the Communists' growing influence as well as the appointment of Raúl Castro, whose Communist sympathies were well known, as commander of Cuba's armed forces. Suspecting an antirevolutionary plot, Fidel Castro had Mr. Matos arrested and charged with treason. Within two months, Mr. Matos was tried, convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. When he was released in 1979, Mr. Matos, nearly blind, went into exile in the USA, where he lived until his death in 2014. Shortly after arriving in Miami and joining the legions of Castro opponents there, Mr. Matos told Worldview magazine: “I differed from Fidel Castro because the original objective of our revolution was ‘Freedom or Death.' Once Castro had power, he began to kill freedom. ” It was not until just before the Bay of Pigs invasion that Mr. Castro declared publicly that his revolution was socialist. A few months later, on Dec. 2, 1961, he removed any lingering doubt about his loyalties when he affirmed in a long speech, “I am a  . ” Many Cubans who had willingly accepted great sacrifice for what they believed would be a democratic revolution were dismayed. They broke ranks with Mr. Castro, putting themselves and their families at risk. Others, from the safety of the USA, publicly accused Mr. Castro of betraying the revolution and called him a tyrant. Even his family began to raise doubts about his intentions. “As I listened, I thought that surely he must be a superb actor,” Mr. Castro's sister Juanita wrote in an account in Life magazine in 1964, referring to the December 1961 speech. “He had fooled not only so many of his friends, but his family as well. ” She recalled his upbringing as the son of a    landowner in eastern Cuba who had sent him to exclusive Jesuit schools. In 1948, after Mr. Castro married Mirta   whose family had ties to the Batista government, his father gave them a   honeymoon in the USA. “How could Fidel, who had been given the best of everything, be a Communist?” Juanita Castro wrote. “This was the riddle which paralyzed me and so many other Cubans who refused to believe that he was leading our country into the Communist camp. ” Although the young Fidel was deeply involved in a radical student movement at the University of Havana, his early allegiance to Communist doctrine was uncertain at best. Some analysts believed that the obstructionist attitudes of American officials had pushed Mr. Castro toward the Soviet Union. Indeed, although Mr. Castro pursued ideologically communist policies, he never established a purely Communist state in Cuba, nor did he adopt orthodox Communist Party ideology. Rather, what developed in Cuba was less doctrinaire, a tropical form of communism that suited his needs. He centralized the economy and flattened out much of the traditional hierarchy of Cuban society, improving education and health care for many Cubans, while depriving them of free speech and economic opportunity. But unlike other Communist countries, Cuba was never governed by a functioning politburo Mr. Castro himself, and later his brother Rául, filled all the important positions in the party, the government and the army, ruling Cuba as its maximum leader. “The Cuban regime turns out to be simply the case of a   dictator seizing a useful ideology in order to employ its wealth against his enemies,” wrote the columnist Georgie Anne Geyer, whose critical biography of Mr. Castro was published in 1991. In this view of Mr. Castro, he was above all an   Spanish caudillo, one of a long line of Latin American strongmen who endeared themselves to people searching for leaders. The analyst Alvaro Vargas Llosa of the Independent Institute in Washington called him “the ultimate   caudillo. ” In Cuba, through good times and bad, Mr. Castro's supporters referred to themselves not as Communists but as Fidelistas. He remained personally popular among segments of Cuban society even after his economic policies created severe hardship. As Mr. Castro consolidated power, eliminated his enemies and grew increasingly autocratic, the Cuban people referred to him simply as Fidel. To say “Castro” was considered disloyal, although in later decades Cubans would commonly say just that and mean it. Or they would invoke his overwhelming presence by simply bringing a hand to their chins, as if to stroke a beard. Mr. Castro's alignment with the Soviet Union meant that the Cold War between the world's superpowers, and the ideological battle between democracy and communism, had erupted in the USA' sphere of influence. A clash was all but inevitable, and it came in October 1962. American spy planes took reconnaissance photos suggesting that the Soviets had exploited their new alliance to build bases in Cuba for   nuclear missiles capable of reaching North America. Mr. Castro allowed the bases to be constructed, but once they were discovered, he became a bit player in the ensuing drama, overshadowed by President John F. Kennedy and the Soviet leader, Nikita S. Khrushchev. Kennedy put USA military forces on alert and ordered a naval blockade of Cuba. The two sides were at a stalemate for 13 tense days, and the world held its breath. Finally, after receiving assurances that the USA would remove American missiles from Turkey and not invade Cuba, the Soviets withdrew the missiles and dismantled the bases. But the Soviet presence in Cuba continued to grow. Soviet troops, technicians and engineers streamed in, eventually producing a generation of blond Cubans with names like Yuri, Alexi and Vladimiro. The Soviets were willing to buy all the sugar Cuba could produce. Even as other Caribbean nations diversified, Cuba decided to stick with one major crop, sugar, and one major buyer. But after forcing the entire nation into a failed effort to reach a record    sugar harvest in 1970, Mr. Castro recognized the need to break the cycle of dependence on the Soviets and sugar. Once more, he relied on his belief in himself and his revolution for solutions. One unlikely consequence was his effort to develop a Cuban supercow. Although he had no training in animal husbandry, Mr. Castro decided to crossbreed humpbacked Asian Zebus with standard Holsteins to create a new breed that could produce milk at prodigious rates. Decades later, the Zebus could still be found grazing in pastures across the island, symbols of Mr. Castro's micromanagement. A few of the hybrids did give more milk, and one that set a milk production record was stuffed and placed in a museum. But most were no better producers than their parents. As the Soviets settled in Cuba in the 1960s, hundreds of Cuban students were sent to Moscow, Prague and other cities of the Soviet bloc to study science and medicine. Admirers from around the world, including some Americans, were impressed with the way that health care and literacy in Cuba had improved. A reshaping of Cuban society was underway. Cuba's tradition of racial segregation was turned upside down as peasants from the countryside, many of them   descendants of Africans enslaved by the Spaniards centuries before, were invited into Havana and other cities that had been overwhelmingly white. They were given the keys to the elegant homes and spacious apartments of the   Cubans who had fled to the USA. Rents came to be little more than symbolic, and basic foods like milk and eggs were sold in government stores at below production cost. Mr. Castro's early overhauls also changed Cuba in ways that were less than utopian.   priests were exiled, and local clergy were harassed so much that many closed their churches. The Roman Catholic Church excommunicated Mr. Castro for violating a 1949 papal decree against supporting Communism. He established a sinister system of local Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, which set neighbors to informing on neighbors. Thousands of dissidents and homosexuals were rounded up and sentenced to either prison or forced labor. And although blacks were welcomed into the cities, Mr. Castro's government remained overwhelmingly white. Mr. Castro regularly fanned the flames of revolution with his oratory. In marathon speeches, he incited the Cuban people by laying out what he considered the evils of capitalism in general and of the USA in particular. For decades, the regime controlled all publications and broadcasting outlets and restricted access to goods and information in ways that would not have been possible if Cuba were not an island. His revolution established at home, Mr. Castro looked to export it. Thousands of Cuban soldiers were sent to Africa to fight in Angola, Mozambique and Ethiopia in support of Communist insurgents. The strain on Cuba's treasury and its society was immense, but Mr. Castro insisted on being a global player in the Communist struggle. As potential threats to his rule were eliminated, Mr. Castro tightened his grip. Camilo Cienfuegos, who had led a division in the insurrection and was immensely popular in Cuba, was killed in a plane crash days after going to arrest Huber Matos in Camagüey on Mr. Castro's orders. His body was never found. Che Guevara, who had become hostile toward the Soviet Union, broke with Mr. Castro before going off to Bolivia, where he was captured and killed in 1967 for trying to incite a revolution there. Despite the fiery rhetoric from Mr. Castro in the early years of the revolution, Washington did attempt a reconciliation. By some accounts, in the weeks before he was assassinated in 1963, Kennedy had aides look at mending fences, providing Mr. Castro was willing to break with the Soviets. But with Kennedy's assassination, and suspicions that Mr. Castro and the Cubans were somehow involved, the 90 miles separating Cuba from the USA became a gulf of antagonism and mistrust. The C. I. A. tried several times to eliminate Mr. Castro or undermine his authority. One plot involved exposing him to a chemical that would cause his beard to fall out, and another using a poison pen to kill him. Mr. Castro often boasted of how many times he had escaped C. I. A. plots to kill him, and he ordered information about the foiled attempts to be put on display at a Havana museum. Relations between the USA and Cuba briefly thawed in the 1970s during the administration of President Jimmy Carter. For the first time,   were allowed to visit family in Havana under strict guidelines. But that fleeting détente ended in 1980 when Mr. Castro tried to defuse growing domestic discontent by allowing about 125, 000 Cubans to flee in boats, makeshift rafts and inner tubes, departing from the beach at Mariel. He used the opportunity to empty Cuban prisons of criminals and people with mental illnesses and force them to join the Mariel boatlift. Mr. Carter's successor, Reagan, slammed shut the door that Mr. Carter had opened. In 1989, when frustrated veterans from Cuba's African ventures began rallying around Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa, who led Cuban forces on the continent, Mr. Castro effectively got rid of a potential rival by bringing the general and some of his supporters to trial on drug charges. General Ochoa and several other   officers were executed on the orders of Raúl Castro, who was then the minister of defense. The USA economic embargo, imposed by Eisenhower and widened by Kennedy, has continued for more than five decades. But its effectiveness was undermined by the Soviet Union, which gave Cuba $5 billion a year in subsidies, and later by Venezuela, which sent Cuba badly needed oil and   economic support. Most other countries, including close USA allies like Canada, maintained relations with Cuba throughout the decades and continued trading with the island. In recent years, successive American presidents have punched big holes in the embargo, allowing a broad range of economic activity, though maintaining the ban on tourism. “I faced my greatest challenge after I turned 60,” Mr. Castro said in an interview with Vanity Fair magazine in 1994. He was referring to the collapse of the Soviet empire, which brought an end to the subsidies that had kept his government afloat for so long. He had also lost a steady source of oil and a reliable buyer for Cuban sugar. Abandoned, isolated, facing increasing dissent at home, Mr. Castro seemed to have come to the end of his line. Cuba's collapse appeared imminent, and Mr. Castro's final hours in power were widely anticipated. Miami exiles began making elaborate preparations for a triumphant return. But Mr. Castro, defying predictions, fought on. He chose an unlikely weapon: the hated American dollar, which he had long condemned as the corrupt symbol of capitalism. In the summer of 1993, he made it legal for Cubans to hold American dollars spent by tourists or sent by exiled family members. That policy eventually led to a dual currency system that has fostered resentment and hampered economic development in Cuba. Mr. Castro, the     was also willing to experiment with capitalism and free enterprise, at least for a time. Encouraged by his brother Raúl, he allowed farmers to sell excess produce at market rates, and he ordered officials to turn a blind eye to small,   kitchens and restaurants, called paladares, that charged market prices. Under Rául Castro, those reforms were broadened considerably, though they were sometimes met with public grumbling from his older brother. But despite his apparent distaste for capitalism, and lingering memories of the 1950s Cuba that preceded his rule, Fidel Castro continued to foster Cuba's tourism industry. He allowed Spanish, Italian and Canadian companies to develop resort hotels and vacation properties, usually in association with an arm of the Cuban military. For many years, the resorts were off limits to most Cubans. They generated hard cash, but a new generation of struggling young Cuban women were lured into prostitution by the tourists' money. For a time, Mexican and Canadian investors poured money into the decrepit telephone company (owned by ITT until it was nationalized by Mr. Castro in 1960) mining operations and other enterprises, which helped keep Cuba's economy from collapsing. He declared an emergency during which he expected the Cuban people to tighten their belts. He called the USA embargo genocide. All his efforts were not enough to keep dissent from sprouting in Havana, Santiago de Cuba and other urban areas during this period of hardship. Despite worldwide condemnation of his actions, Mr. Castro clamped down on a fledgling democracy movement, jailing anyone who dared to call for free elections. He also cracked down on the nucleus of an independent press, imprisoning or harassing Cuban reporters and editors. In 1994, for the first time, demonstrators took to the streets of Havana to express their anger over the failed promises of the revolution. Mr. Castro had to personally appeal for calm. Then, in early 1996, he seized an opportunity to rebuild his support by again demonizing the USA. A South Florida group, Brothers to the Rescue, had been flying three civilian planes toward the Cuban coast when two were shot down by Cuban military jets. Four men on board were killed. Mr. Castro raged against Washington, maintaining that the planes had violated Cuban airspace. American officials condemned the attack. Until then, President Bill Clinton had been moving discreetly but steadily toward easing the USA embargo and   some relations with Cuba. But in the wake of the attack, and the virulent reaction from   in Florida  —   a state Mr. Clinton considered important to his   bid  —   he reluctantly signed the   law, which allowed the USA to punish foreign companies that were using confiscated American property in Cuba. The State Department's first warnings under the new law went to a Canadian mining company that had taken over a huge nickel mine, and a Mexican investment group that had purchased the Cuban telephone company. Despite protests from American allies, the USA maintained the   law as a weapon against Mr. Castro, although all its provisions have never been carried out. But in Cuba, the American actions reinforced Mr. Castro's complaints about American arrogance and helped channel domestic dissent toward Washington. One of his strengths as a communicator  —   he considered Reagan his only worthy competitor in that regard  —   had always been to transform his anger toward the USA into a rallying cry for the Cuban people. “We are left with the honor of being one of the few adversaries of the USA,” Mr. Castro told Maria Shriver of NBC in a 1998 interview. When Ms. Shriver asked him if that truly was an honor, he answered, “Of course. ” “For such a small country as Cuba to have such a gigantic country as the USA live so obsessed with this island,” he said, “it is an honor for us. ” As he grew older and grayer, Mr. Castro could no longer be easily linked to the intense guerrilla fighter who had come out of the Sierra Maestra. He rambled incoherently in his long speeches. He was rumored to be suffering from various diseases. After 40 years, the revolution he started no longer held promise, and Cubans by the thousands, including many who had never known any other life but under Mr. Castro, risked their lives trying to reach the USA on rafts, inner tubes and even old trucks outfitted with floats. Although the revolution lost its luster, what never diminished was Mr. Castro's ability to confound American officials and to create situations to seize the advantage of a particular moment. That was evident early in 1998 when Pope John Paul II visited Havana and met with Mr. Castro. The meeting was widely expected to be seen as a rebuke and an embarrassment to Mr. Castro. The aging   pontiff stood beside the aging Communist leader, who had abandoned his military uniform for the occasion in favor of a dark suit. The pope talked about human rights and the lack of basic freedoms in Cuba. But he also called Washington's embargo “unjust and ethically unacceptable,” allowing Mr. Castro to claim a political if not a moral victory. The next year, Mr. Castro converted another conflict into an opportunity to bolster his standing among his own people while infuriating the USA. A young woman and her    son were among more than a dozen Cubans who had set out for Florida in a   aluminum boat. The boat capsized and the woman drowned, but the boy, Elián González, survived two days in an inner tube before being picked up by the USA Coast Guard and taken to Miami, where he was united with relatives. Later, however, the relatives refused to release the boy when his father, in Cuba, demanded his return. The standoff between the family and USA officials created the kind of emotional and political drama that Mr. Castro had become a master at manipulating for his own purposes. Mr. Castro made the boy another symbol of American oppression, which diverted attention from the deteriorating conditions in Cuba. After several months, American agents seized the boy from his Miami relatives and returned him to his father in Cuba, where he was greeted by Mr. Castro. That episode carried great significance for Mr. Castro in the way it echoed one in his personal life. Mr. Castro and his wife, Mirta   divorced in 1955, six years after the birth of their son, Fidelito. In 1956, when Mr. Castro and Ms.   were both in Mexico, Mr. Castro arranged to have the boy visit him before embarking on what he said would be a dangerous voyage, which turned out to be his invasion of Cuba. He promised to bring the boy back in two weeks, but it was a trick. At the end of that period, Mr. Castro placed Fidelito in the custody of a friend in Mexico City. He then sailed for Cuba with his fellow rebels on the yacht Granma. The boy's mother, with the help of her family and the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City, found a team of professional kidnappers, who ambushed the boy and his guardians in a park and carried him off. Ms.   took Fidelito to NY and enrolled him in a local school for a year. But after Mr. Castro entered Havana and grabbed control of the government, he persuaded his former wife to send the boy back. The younger Mr. Castro lived in Cuba until, years later, he was sent to the Soviet Union to study. He became a physicist, married a Russian woman and eventually returned to Cuba, where he was named head of Cuba's nuclear power program. Details of Mr. Castro's personal life were always murky. He had no formal home but lived in many different houses and estates in and around Havana. He had relationships with several women, and only in his later years was he willing to acknowledge that he had a relationship of more than 40 years with Dalia Soto del Valle, who had rarely been seen in public. (Whether they were legally married was not clear.) The two had five sons  —   Alexis, Alexander, Alejandro, Antonio and Ángel  —   all of whom live in Cuba. Mr. Castro also has a daughter, Alina, a radio host in Miami, who bitterly attacked her father on the air for years. Mr. Castro had stormy relations with many of his relatives both in Cuba and the USA. He remained close to Celia Sánchez, a woman who was with him in the Sierra Maestra and who looked after his schedule and his archives devotedly, until she died in 1980. A sister, Ángela Castro, died at 88 in Havana in February 2012, according to The Associated Press, quoting her sister Juanita. And his elder brother Ramón died in February 2016 at 91. Outlasting all his enemies, Mr. Castro lived to rule a country where the overwhelming majority of people had never known any other leader. Hardly anyone talked openly of a time without him until the day, in 2001, when he appeared to faint while giving a speech. Then, in 2004, he stumbled while leaving a platform, breaking a kneecap and reminding Cubans again of his mortality and forcing them to confront their future. As Mr. Castro and his revolution aged, Cuban dissidents grew bolder. Oswaldo Payá, using a clause in the Cuban Constitution, collected thousands of signatures in a petition demanding a referendum on free speech and other political freedoms. (Mr. Payá died in a car crash in 2012.) Bloggers wrote disparagingly of Mr. Castro and the regime, although most of their missives could not be read in Cuba, where internet access was strictly limited. A group of Cuban women who called themselves the Ladies in White rallied on Sundays to protest the imprisonment of their fathers, husbands and sons, whose pictures they carried on posters inscribed with the number of years to which they were sentenced as political prisoners. After being made his brother's successor, Raúl Castro tried to control the fragments of the revolution that remained after Fidel Castro fell ill, including a close association with President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, who modeled himself after Fidel. (Mr. Chávez died in 2013.) Never as popular as his brother, Raúl Castro was considered a better manager, and in some ways was seen as more conscious of the everyday needs of the Cuban people, despite his reputation as the revolution's executioner. One of his first moves as leader was to replace the grossly overcrowded city buses, known as “camels,” with new ones, many imported from China. He opened up the economy somewhat, allowing entrepreneurs to start businesses, and he eased restrictions on traveling, access to cellphones, computers and other personal items, and the buying and selling of property. Still, Raúl Castro came under mounting pressure from Cubans demanding even more economic and political opportunity. He took more steps to open the economy and, in so doing, dismantled parts of the socialist state that his brother had defended for so long. Lurking in the background as Raúl Castro embarked on that new course was the brooding visage of Fidel, whose revolution has been seen as a rebellion of one man. When Obama and Raúl Castro simultaneously went on TV in their countries in 2014 to announce a prisoner exchange and the first steps toward normalizing relations, Cubans and Americans alike expected to hear Fidel either accepting or condemning the moves. Six weeks after the deal was announced, Mr. Castro, or someone writing in his name, finally reacted in a way that combined his own bluster and his brother's new approach. “I do not trust the politics of the USA, nor have I exchanged a word with them, but this is not, in any way, a rejection of a peaceful solution to conflicts,” Mr. Castro wrote near the end of a rambling letter to students on the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of his own time at the University of Havana. Sounding more like his brother than his old self, he backed any peaceful attempts to resolve the problems between the two countries. He then took one final swipe at his old nemesis. “The grave dangers that threaten humanity today have to give way to norms that are compatible with human dignity,” the letter said. “No country is excluded from such rights. With this spirit I have fought, and will continue fighting, until my last breath. ” In April 2016, a frail Mr. Castro made what many thought would be his last public appearance, at the Seventh Congress of the Cuban Communist Party. Dressed in an incongruous blue tracksuit jacket, his hands at times quivering and his once powerful voice reduced to a tinny squawk, he expressed surprise at having survived to almost 90, and he bade farewell to the party, the political system and the revolutionary Cuba he had created. “Soon I will be like everybody else,” Mr. Castro said. “Our turn comes to us all, but the ideas of Cuban communism will endure. ” No one is sure if the force of the revolution will dissipate without Mr. Castro and, eventually, his brother. But Fidel Castro's impact on Latin America and the Western Hemisphere has the earmarks of lasting indefinitely. The power of his personality remains inescapable, for better or worse, not only in Cuba but also throughout Latin America. “We are going to live with Fidel Castro and all he stands for while he is alive,” wrote Mr. Matthews of The Times, whose own fortunes were dimmed considerably by his connection to Mr. Castro, “and with his ghost when he is dead. ”"
7069,25561,"‘Born a Crime,' Trevor Noah's Raw Account of Life Under Apartheid - The NY Times",NY Times,Michiko Kakutani,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"As host of “The Daily Show,” Trevor Noah comes across as a wry, startled and sometimes outraged outsider, commenting on the absurdities of American life. During the presidential campaign, the South   comic remarked that Donald J. Trump reminded him of an African dictator, mused over the mystifying complexities of the Electoral College system and pointed out the weirdness of states voting on recreational marijuana. In the countdown to and aftermath of the election, Mr. Noah has grown more comfortable at moving back and forth between jokes and earnest insights, between humor and serious asides  —   the way he's done in his   act, and now, in his compelling new memoir, “Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood. ” By turns alarming, sad and funny, his book provides a harrowing look, through the prism of Mr. Noah's family, at life in South Africa under apartheid and the country's lurching entry into a postapartheid era in the 1990s. Some stories will be familiar to fans who have followed the author's   act. But his accounts here are less the polished anecdotes of a comedian underscoring the absurdities of life under apartheid, than raw, deeply personal reminiscences about being “   ” in a country where his birth “violated any number of laws, statutes and regulations. ” The son of a Xhosa mother and a   father, Mr. Noah recalls that “the only time I could be with my father was indoors”: “If we left the house, he'd have to walk across the street from us. ” It was dangerous, as a   child, to be seen with his mother as well: “She would hold my hand or carry me, but if the police showed up she would have to drop me and pretend I wasn't hers. ” He spent much of his time at home: “I didn't have any friends. I didn't know any kids besides my cousins. I wasn't a lonely kid  —   I was good at being alone. I'd read books, play with the toy that I had, make up imaginary worlds. I lived inside my head. To this day you can leave me alone for hours and I'm perfectly happy entertaining myself. I have to remember to be with people. ” Language, he discovered early on, was a way to camouflage his difference. His mother knew Xhosa, Zulu, German, Afrikaans, Sotho and used her knowledge “to cross boundaries, handle situations, navigate the world. ” She made sure that English was the first language her son spoke because “if you're black in South Africa, speaking English is the one thing that can give you a leg up. ” “English is the language of money,” Mr. Noah goes on. “English comprehension is equated with intelligence. If you're looking for a job, English is the difference between getting the job or staying unemployed. ” A gifted mimic, Trevor learned to become “a chameleon,” using language to gain acceptance in school and on the streets. “If you spoke to me in Zulu, I replied to you in Zulu,” he writes. “If you spoke to me in Tswana, I replied to you in Tswana. Maybe I didn't look like you, but if I spoke like you, I was you. ” Mr. Noah offers a series of   snapshots of life in the township of Soweto, where his maternal grandmother lived, and where, he recalls, “99. 9 percent” of the residents were black, and his light skin made him a neighborhood curiosity. He remembers: “The township was in a constant state of insurrection someone was always marching or protesting somewhere and had to be suppressed. Playing in my grandmother's house, I'd hear gunshots, screams, tear gas being fired into crowds. ” To save money, Mr. Noah recalls, his mother perfected the art of coasting their old, rusty Volkswagen downhill “between work and school, between school and home,” and enlisting her son's help in pushing the car when the gas ran out. One month, he says, money was so short that they were forced to subsist on bowls of wild spinach, cooked with mopane worms, “the cheapest thing that only the poorest of poor people eat. ” By high school, Mr. Noah writes, he had become an enterprising businessman, copying and selling pirated CDs he and his business partners would soon segue into the D. J. business, throwing raucous dance parties in Alexandra, “a tiny, dense pocket of a shantytown,” known as Gomorrah because it had “the wildest parties and the worst crimes. ” After Mr. Noah's father moved to Cape Town, his mother married an auto mechanic, whose English name, Abel, recalled the good brother in the Bible, but whose Tsonga name, Ngisaveni, says Mr. Noah, meant “Be afraid. ” Those names would turn out to be a harbinger of his stepfather's dual personality  —   charming and eager to be liked on the surface, but, as Mr. Noah recalls, highly controlling, and capable of violence. In the end, “Born a Crime” is not just an unnerving account of growing up in South Africa under apartheid, but a love letter to the author's remarkable mother, who grew up in a hut with 14 cousins, and determined that her son would not grow up paying what she called “the black tax”  —   black families having to “spend all of their time trying to fix the problems of the past,” using their skills and education to bring their relatives “back up to zero,” because “the generations who came before you have been pillaged. ” It's the story of a fiercely religious woman, who attributes her miraculous survival from a gunshot wound to the head (inflicted by Abel) to her faith a woman who took her son to three churches on Sunday (as well as a prayer meeting on Tuesday, Bible study on Wednesday and youth church on Thursday) even when there were dangerous riots in the streets and few dared to venture out of their homes. The names chosen for Xhosa children traditionally have meanings, Mr. Noah observes: His mother's name, Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah, means “She Who Gives Back” his cousin's name, Mlungisi, means “The Fixer. ” His mother, Mr. Noah writes, deliberately gave him a name, Trevor, with “no meaning whatsoever in South Africa, no precedent in my family. ” “It's not even a biblical name,” he writes. “It's just a name. My mother wanted her child beholden to no fate. She wanted me to be free to go anywhere, do anything, be anyone. ”"
7671,26356,"Raising 2 Young Children by Herself, in a Space That Feels Not Big Enough - The NY Times",NY Times,Masha Goncharova,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"In her cramped apartment in Upper Manhattan, Paola Infante cooked chicken and rice on a gas stove, stirring the meal as she kept an eye on her daughter, Geraliz, racing around the room. Each time the girl came near the flames and kitchen knives, Ms. Infante used her body to gently push her away. Geraliz, who is 4 and has autism, eventually distracted herself watching children's shows on a   iPad. For the moment, the possibility that she might get hurt had passed. “So much nervousness,” Ms. Infante, 27, said in Spanish. “I wish for a bigger apartment with all of my soul. A separate kitchen, this is all I need. ” She added, “There's been a lot of breaks and spills. ” Almost every surface in the small   apartment doubles as a space for something else: pots and pans on top of magazines, children's toys atop cleaning supplies and food wrappers. With no formal kitchen area, a gas stove, a refrigerator and cabinets line the      living room's back wall. Ms. Infante, who immigrated from the Dominican Republic, is raising Geraliz and her    son, Joshua, by herself. Geraliz communicates in screeches and tugs at her mother. Joshua was born with a deformed heart, but will not be healthy enough for   surgery until he turns 1 in April. Ms. Infante said the children's father, her former boyfriend, had moved out because he did not feel that he could cope with the challenges involved in raising Geraliz. “He couldn't handle it emotionally,” she said as she sat in one of the apartment's only chairs, a tiny seat for her children. “It was too much for him to accept. ” During the day, Ms. Infante works as a cashier at a Key Food grocery store, earning $800 a month and struggling because of her limited ability to speak English to earn a promotion. She said she did not want to depend on public assistance but had to, collecting about $1, 050 a month combined in food stamps and disability benefits. At night, almost everything is a chore. While she prepares dinner or cleans the apartment, she tries to distract Geraliz with the iPad while hoping that Joshua does not start to cry. Doing the laundry meant lugging the dirty clothes to a laundromat two blocks away with the children in tow. To save money on drying, she would carry the wet clothes back to her     and hang them on a line in the hallway leading into the apartment. That cumbersome task was recently made easier. Catholic Charities Archdiocese of NY, one of the eight organizations supported by The NY Times's Neediest Cases Fund, gave her $350 toward a $800 washing machine and helped to have it installed in her apartment. Ms. Infante still   the clothes. It has also become less stressful to make sure that her children are safe while she is at work. Catholic Charities guided Ms. Infante to enroll Geraliz at the Kennedy Child Study Center, an affiliate agency that provides free services for children with developmental challenges. Ms. Infante said her daughter was getting better at communicating and, with the help of workers at the center, had learned how to grab ahold of her when she needed attention. The center also helped Ms. Infante enroll in English classes at the City College of NY, which start in February. She said she wanted to earn a bachelor's degree in childhood education and get a job as a teacher within five years. For those plans to work out, she will need to find a babysitter for Joshua by the time classes begin. The center is also helping her make those arrangements. Ms. Infante said that her former boyfriend was still around. He lives in a separate apartment in Upper Manhattan, works at another grocery store and pays the rent on Ms. Infante's place. He visits the children “once or twice a week” at their apartment, she said, but she is not ready to welcome him back full time. “I don't need anyone or anything,” she said, rising quickly to stir the rice and check on the chicken. “I'm fine. What I need is a separate kitchen so I can cook without worrying about the kids. ”"
7800,26536,Mexicans Accuse President of ‘Historic Error' in Welcoming Trump - The NY Times,NY Times,Azam Ahmed and Elisabeth Malkin,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"MEXICO CITY  —   If President Enrique Peña Nieto invited Donald J. Trump to visit Mexico for a dialogue in the interest of democracy, the message has fallen on deaf ears. Instead, the predominant feeling here in the Mexican capital is one of betrayal. “It's a historic error,” said Enrique Krauze, a   historian. “You confront tyrants. You don't appease them. ” On Mexico's most popular morning television show on Wednesday, a livid Mr. Krauze likened the president's meeting with Mr. Trump to the decision by Neville Chamberlain, then the British prime minister, to sit down with Hitler in Munich in 1938. “It isn't brave to meet in private with somebody who has insulted and denigrated” Mexicans, Mr. Krauze said. “It isn't dignified to simply have a dialogue. ” Yes, many Mexicans say, it was Mr. Trump who offended the people of Mexico with his disparaging comments about migrants and his promises to build a border wall paid for by Mexico. But for many Mexicans, the surprising invitation from Mr. Peña Nieto  —   who has likened Mr. Trump's language to that of Hitler and Mussolini in the past  —   is even worse. Newspapers, television stations, social media and all manner of national communications were awash in vitriol at the idea of a meeting between the two men, while political analysts on both sides of the border said they were mystified about why Mr. Peña Nieto invited Mr. Trump. “It is Peña Nieto's worst mistake so far and one we still don't understand,” said Vidal Romero, the head of the political science department at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, a university in Mexico City. “This would only hurt him. ” But as others pointed out, Mr. Trump is the Republican presidential candidate, and not the first to visit a Mexican president. John McCain came to Mexico when he was running against Obama. “At the end of the day, this is the Republican candidate,” said Rafael Fernández de Castro, a professor at Syracuse University and former foreign policy adviser to Felipe Calderón, the previous Mexican president. “The U. S. electorate put him in this position, and Peña is respecting that. ” Ultimately, he said, foreign policy cannot always be guided by public opinion, no matter the political consequences. “He has everything to lose in the media, but this is about governing,” Mr. Fernández de Castro said. “He had no other choice  —   a good relationship with the U. S. is essential for the   of Mexico. ” From that perspective, with his approval ratings already low, Mr. Peña Nieto may have less to lose than is commonly thought. If the goal was to ensure national interests in the event Mr. Trump wins, then the furor over the visit seemed a political cost the government was willing to take. Still, there is “unanimity that this is a giant farce,” said Jesús   Márquez, a professor at the Tecnólogico de Monterrey in Mexico City and columnist for Reforma, a Mexico City newspaper. Mr. Peña Nieto “compared Mr. Trump to Mussolini and Hitler,” he added, “and now we invite Mussolini, we are going to negotiate with Hitler when he hasn't even won the election. ” After the men met, in what Mr. Trump described as an “excellent” occasion, they spoke at a very civil news conference. Mr. Peña Nieto promised to work with whichever candidate was elected and emphasized the importance of ties with the USA. “I shared with him the fact that there have been misunderstandings or affirmations that hurt and affected Mexicans in their perception of his candidacy,” Mr. Peña Nieto said he told Mr. Trump. “The Mexican people felt aggravated for comments that were formulated, but I am certain that he has a genuine interest in building a relationship that would lead us to provide better conditions for our people. ” While Mr. Trump hardly offered Mexicans the sort of apology many had hoped for, he was a far more chastened candidate than they had come to expect. He repeatedly lauded their hard work, and spoke of his “tremendous feeling” for Mexicans. “They are amazing people,” he noted. In the end, he called Mr. Peña Nieto a friend. Citing Mr. Trump's more respectful tone, the government described the meeting as a success. “It was a different Trump,” said Eduardo Sánchez, the president's spokesman. “The attitude of this Trump is different from the ones we have seen before today. ” But Shannon K. O'Neil, a Mexico expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in NY, said: “I don't see how that helped Peña Nieto. If the reason Peña was inviting Trump was to stand up to him and show his strength in front of somebody who has attacked Mexicans, then he failed. ” Other critics were less kind. “To put it mildly, I think it was the biggest humiliation a Mexican president has suffered on his own territory in the last 50 years,” said Esteban Illades, editor of Nexos, a magazine in Mexico. “He not only managed to make Trump look presidential, which is an incredibly hard thing to do, he managed to forgive Trump even though he didn't actually offer an apology in the first place. ” Mexican officials did not clearly articulate the reasons for the visit at first. Later, in a news release, the president explained the rationale for the meeting as being in the interest of democracy and to create a dialogue. In his remarks, Mr. Peña Nieto suggested that he wanted to fortify the nation's ties with its most important global partner, while standing up for Mexico. “I also made him notice and feel the great responsibility I have as president of Mexico, to defend the Mexican people, both those who are here and abroad,” Mr. Peña Nieto said after the meeting. Some argued that the invitation was a distraction from the domestic problems that have gnawed at the president. Violence is rising, new scandals seem to emerge regularly and the impunity that lies at the heart of discord in Mexico remains undisturbed. Most recently, the president was accused of plagiarizing a third of his law school thesis, which his office explained as an error in citation. Others were not convinced by that explanation, contending meeting with Mr. Trump hardly made the other problems go away. “I do not see this as a distraction to his problems the visit will only add to the problems he faces in Mexico,” said Jason Marczak, a director in the Atlantic Council's Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, a research center. “Trump will come out of this meeting carrying the message of the meeting. ” “He will use Peña Nieto as a political pawn in his campaign,” he added."
16176,34912,Anti-Trump Students Protest Hampshire College Raising American Flag to Full-Staff - Breitbart,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Students at Hampshire College were upset Friday when school officials decided to raise the American Flag once again to   after students demanded it be placed at   because of the election of Donald J. Trump. [Students at the Amherst, Massachusetts college had initially lowered the flag to   in protest against the results of the November 8 election. Days after that move a group of students later pulled the flag down and burned it.  The controversy at the college continued when on Veteran's Day college officials raised a new flag to memorialize the armed forces, but students again launched into protest. Eventually Hampshire College President Jonathan Lash pulled the flag down entirely and opened a “dialog” on how the flag controversy was affecting the school. The decision to fully remove the flag led to a November 27   against the    . S. statement being fostered by the school. Hundreds of veterans of America's armed forces gathered outside the school to protest the   stance the school was taking. “There's other ways that he [Lash] could have dealt with this,” VFW Post Commander Victor A. Nunez Ortiz said at the Nov. 27  . “[Removing] our flag is disrespectful not just to the men and women who have served, but to all Americans who believe our flag is a symbol of freedom. ” President Lash, though, disputed the claim that his school was speaking against the country or our veterans. “We did not lower the flag to make a political statement. Nor did we intend to cause offense to veterans, military families, or others for whom the flag represents service and sacrifice,” Lash said. “We acted solely to facilitate   dialogue on our campus about how to dismantle the bigotry that is prevalent in our society. ” Upon raising the new flag, Lash insisted the move was a “symbol of that freedom, and in hopes for justice and fairness for all. ” Some Hampshire students claimed that the flag represented an evil nation and that the removal of the flag after the election was a “reaction to the toxic tone of the   election. ” The most recent comments by President Lash stand in contrast to his earlier claims when he excused the actions of students saying the flag represented “a powerful symbol of fear they've felt all their lives because they grew up in marginalized communities, never feeling safe. ” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com."

Ramos said his track record proves that he'd have no problem asking both Trump and Democrat Clinton probing questions. “I am a registered independent,” he said. “I am never partisan. ” He wrote in a Time magazine column last month that journalists, politicians and voters will “be judged by how we responded to Trump. Like it or not, this election is a plebiscite on the most divisive, polarizing and disruptive figure in American politics in decades. And neutrality is not an option. ” He wrote that people will be asked if they were brave enough to challenge Trump “when he insulted immigrants, Muslims, women, war heroes and people with disabilities? Are you on the record correcting his lies?” That led to criticism that Ramos, who anchors a program where many Latinos seek an unbiased look at the news, mixed advocacy with journalism. Conservative watchdogs the Media Research Center urged that Univision remove Ramos as an anchor, at least through Election Day. The history goes deeper: Trump ordered Ramos ejected from a news conference last year after Ramos questioned him about an immigration plan the journalist said was “full of empty promises. ” The first of three planned debates between Trump and Clinton is scheduled for Sept. 26. The commission on presidential debates is expected to announce moderators after Labor Day. In a regular column he writes for The NY Times Syndicate, Ramos said this week that it was “high time” for a Latino journalist to get one of those slots. He suggested Maria Elena Salinas from Univision, Jose   of Telemundo, Maria Hinojosa of NPR and ABC's Cecilia Vega or Tom Llamas as people who could do the job, but didn't mention himself. In a later interview, he expressed interest, and said his Time column shouldn't disqualify him. “What I've said is that we, as journalists, can't remain neutral when a politician makes racist remarks,” he said. “That's all. But in all our shows we report objectively about all the things (Trump) says and does. ” He noted that he questioned Clinton about Benghazi and her emails during a Democratic debate, asked vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine last weekend about possible conflicts of interest at the ClintonFoundation and has criticized Obama's deportation policies. Brent Bozell, president of the Media Research Center, said the Trump campaign would probably “burst out laughing” if Ramos were ever named a debate moderator. “It's slippery what he's saying, and it's unfortunate that he's been so slippery, when he's saying that he's just a journalist who is asking questions,” Bozell said. “That is just not true. He is an activist making statements. And some of them have been vicious about Trump. ” Daniel Coronell, Univision's news division's president, said he would support having Ramos as a debate moderator, although he believes there's little chance of Ramos or any other Latino journalist getting one of those slots. Coronell said Univision has no problem with the stances that Ramos has taken. “We are journalists,” he said. “But we are members of a community that demands respect from the candidates. ”"

[In posts on social media and in at least one essay on the subject, critics said the role of the transgender sex worker in the film should have gone to a transgender actor. According to Variety, Anything centers on a man (John Carroll Lynch) who, despondent over the death of his wife, moves from Mississippi to Los Angeles and strikes up a romantic relationship with a transgender sex worker.  Bomer, who is gay, is not transgender. Activists quickly took to Twitter to criticize the casting choice: Dear Matt Bomer, You're great, but you're neither strong nor brave playing a trans character.

Last year, actress Michelle Rodriguez was cast as a transgender hitman in director Walter Hill's upcoming film (Re) Assignment, and photos taken from the set in recent weeks have led to criticism that the role should have been cast with a transgender actor.

Awhile back I decided to do some poking around to see what updates I came across concerning the deplorable new movie formerly known as ”Tomboy: A Revenger's Tale” starring Michelle Rodriguez (@MRodOfficial). It has now been renamed ”(Re) Assignment”. Apparently ”Tomboy” was to insensitive of a title. Written and directed by Walter Hill (from a story by Denis Hamill) the film centers on an expert assassin who is   and transformed into a woman (Rodriguez) by a rogue surgeon (Sigourney Weaver) and then sets out for vengeance.

[According to the Los Angeles Times, the survivors had filed a federal lawsuit against the theater chain, alleging the Aurora theater's lax security protocols led to the July 20, 2012 shooting attack in which 12 people were killed and 70 injured after gunman James Holmes opened fire during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises.  In May, a judge had reportedly warned the more than   plaintiffs in the suit that he was prepared to rule that Cinemark was not liable for the deaths, as the theater could not have predicted what Holmes would do. The judge reportedly urged the parties to settle, and Cinemark offered a settlement: $150, 000, to be split between the 41 plaintiffs. But four of the victims  —   including one who reportedly lost a child in the shooting, became paralyzed and lost another child she was carrying —   remained on. Cinemark won at trial, and, in June, submitted a $700, 000 legal bill. A judge this week ruled that the four plaintiffs who had remained on were liable to repay it. Marcus Weaver, a survivor who was shot in the shoulder during the attack, called Cinemark's settlement offer a “slap in the face,” though he had been prepared to accept it at the time with the hope that the theater chain would be forced to make improvements to its security. Now, the theater chain is apparently free of both all financial liability and the need to overhaul its safety procedures. “It's almost like everything was for naught,” he told the Times. Holmes was convicted on all counts last July and was sentenced to 12 consecutive life terms plus more than 3, 000 years in jail.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum"
17580,36319,Blair Gifts Money to Set up New Anti-Populist 'Institute',Breitbart,Nick Hallett,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair is to invest in a new “not for profit institute” dedicated to dreaming up   globalist policies. [The former PM insisted the Tony Blair Institute would not be a vehicle for his return to frontline politics, but instead would be a “platform” offering “thought leadership”.  He acknowledged it was “abundantly clear” he could not personally return to British politics after the Iraq War, but added: “I care about my country and the world my children and grandchildren will grow up in and want to play at least a small part in contributing to the debate about the future of both. ” He said the new institute would “build a new policy agenda” for what he called the “centre ground” of politics, as well as allowing “a reasonable and evidence based discussion of the future which avoids the plague of social   exchanges of abuse. ” The former Prime Minister hinted one of the focuses of the new institute would be supporting European integration as well as open borders. “Part of its focus will plainly be around the European debate but this will not be its exclusive domain. “It has to go far wider than that since in many ways the Europe debate is a lightning rod for the whole of politics. ” Populism, Mr Blair said, was growing on both the left and the right, threatening the “ ” process of globalisation and the “benefits” The Mail quotes him as saying: “This new populism may differ in some respects between left and right  —   the left   the right    —   but in others, what is remarkable is the convergence between them, especially around isolationism and protectionism, in what is an essentially   approach to globalisation and its benefits and to international engagement. ” His Institute comes as voters across Europe and North America turn against globalisation and open borders, and the elite that supports them. A survey last month found that a majority of voters in various European countries, including France, were ready to embrace populism. A total of 63 per cent of French voters said they supported populist ideas such as   national identity and strong borders. In Britain, 48 per cent said they would support a populist platform."
17841,36581,"Kellogg Foundation Gave Big to Soros Organization, Tides Foundation",Breitbart,Lee Stranahan,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"The institutional left's funding behemoth W. K. Kellogg Foundation has partnered with and given major donations to George Soros's Open Society Institute and the Tides Center as part of its massive push to promote a   agenda. [The W. K. Kellogg Foundation is the nonprofit arm of cereal and sweets giant Kellogg's, based in Battle Creek, Michigan. The Kellogg Company is chiefly known for its breakfast brands, including Special K cereal, Eggo® waffles, and  ® but its namesake nonprofit W. K. Kellogg Foundation is one of the largest institutional funders in the world and is the seventh largest philanthropic foundation in the USA.  The Kellogg's website explains the history of the Foundation: As the USA sunk into the Depression, W. K. Kellogg declared, “I'll invest in people. ” He split shifts and hired new employees to work them. He also founded the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, whose mission  —   to help children realize their potential  —   complements that of the Kellogg Company to this day. In recent years, however, the focus of the Foundation has drifted away from just helping children toward promoting   political issues.  Examples of such funding include a direct grant to George Soros's Open Society Institute, which received $200, 000 from the Foundation to “eliminate racial inequities in the juvenile justice system and promote racial healing through   conferences, policy changes, and communication strategies. ” Two other   groups, the Tides Center and Tides Foundation, both based in San Francisco, are also top recipients of funds and support from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation. A search of the grants given by the Foundation for “Tides” yields over 120 results. Most recently, on November 1, 2016, the W. K. Kellogg Foundation gave $2, 150, 000 to the Tides Center in order to: Scale up    benefits for vulnerable children through continued expansion to early care and education sites and diversification of partnerships, ensuring equitable access and institutionalization, Another W. K. Kellogg Foundation grant in 2016 gave over $380, 000 to Tides in order to: Provide updated   describing the state of grantmaking with a racial   justice lens, including insights to support grantmaking considerations at the program officer and institutional levels, through support of the Philanthropic Initiative for Racial Equity, The   program descriptions go along with the way George Soros, one of the world's wealthiest men, portrays his “open societies” vision. An article on Fox News described the model for Soros's charitable contributions as “  world government,     controlled media,   and even   and against the very institutions that stand for traditional values such as family and faith. ” The connection between the W. K. Kellogg Foundation and Tides appears to go beyond mere funding. In a section of the Tides website called “Expanding Your Reach,” Tides explains to community organizers and   grant recipients how they can be part of a “partnership” with the W. K. Kellogg Foundation and other top institutional left funders to get more of the billions of dollars available for issues ranging from elections to immigration reform and foreign policy. The website says: In partnership with institutions like The California Endowment, The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, Open Society Foundations, W. K. Kellogg Foundation, Gates Foundation, Ford Foundation, and many others, we have granted hundreds of millions of dollars. With Tides, your foundation can ease administrative burden, expand programmatic capacity, collaborate effectively, and increase the impact of your grantmaking programs. Tides is a platform for funding collaboratives that address issues as diverse as global disability rights, election administration reform, and   LGBT advocacy. Funders also start innovative programs with Tides that cross multiple issues, such as the integration of reproductive health with   treatment in Africa. Tides also provides vehicles to support funding advocacy on critical policy issues like immigration reform, health care and U. S. foreign policy. Tides was founded in 1976. One important institutional left figure who is part of Tides is Wade Rathke, whose official biography on his own blog lists him as “Founder of ACORN, Chief Organizer at ACORN International, Author of Citizen Wealth, Global Grassroots and The Battle for the 9th Ward,” in addition to pointing out: Wade is also the Chair of the Organizers' Forum, which brings together labor and community organizers for two dialogues per year, one domestic and one international. The Organizers' Forum is a project of the Tides Center. Wade was a founding board member of the Tides Foundation and continues to serve as senior advisor of the San   organization and for a number of their entities including the Paradox Fund and Frontera Fund. It's unclear how many consumers are aware of Kellogg's institutional leftist funding through its namesake nonprofit, but it's safe to say not all agree with the company's   political views. In 2014, the Kellogg Company was criticized by some for an ad featuring its Frosted Flakes Tony the Tiger character saying, “Wear your stripes with pride,” to promote the company's sponsorship of a gay pride march in Atlanta, Georgia. As Breitbart News has also reported, the W. K. Kellogg Foundation has put over $75, 000, 000 into an initiative to “combat structural racism in America. ” An article on the Foundation's website explains: Since the birth of America, racial privilege and structural inequities have influenced the nation's policies and social systems, from healthcare, education and child welfare to media, food consumption, justice and countless other facets of everyday life. In America, those who differ from the majority because of race, color, sexual orientation, religion, gender, weight and other characteristics face a deluge of outright discrimination and unconscious bias.

Business Insider, who say they have spoken to people involved in the project as well as seeing internal Facebook documentation, reports that Facebook are planning on approaching their preferred media companies in the coming weeks.

In the run up the election, Facebook   Dustin Moskovitz gave over $35 million to   causes in an attempt to defeat Trump, whilst Clinton was the largest single beneficary of political donations from Facebook employees. The development comes following hysteria surrounding the rise of “fake news,” with many people blaming the role of social media, particularly Facebook, for the election of Trump. However, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has rejected this claim, describing it as “crazy. ” “The idea that fake news on Facebook, of which it's a very small amount of the content, influenced the election is a pretty crazy idea,” Zuckerberg said at the time.

The wall, which several previously   areas of the U. S.  border already have —  whether an actual wall or a several tiered fencing and integrated technological system —  has been a controversial issue to pundits and politicians who lack information on the subject. [Trump's idea to force the cartels to pay will likely manifest in the form of seizing their assets. It is likely that the U. S. State Department's diplomatic shackles placed upon the FBI will be removed, as it is common knowledge that the State Department pressures the FBI to balance their law enforcement priorities with diplomatic concerns —  a restriction that makes it difficult to properly address Mexican cartels when many of the elected leaders in Mexico are actually surrogates for those very cartels, as Breitbart Texas has reported ad nauseam.  Trump's plan, as stated as early as March 2016, never included a wall on all 1, 954 miles of land border. Trump committed to give the actual Border Patrol agents who patrol each of the nine sectors on the southwest border a seat at the policy table and to listen to where a wall is needed and where one is unneeded —  a fact most pundits and journalists seemingly missed as they mistakenly discuss his allegedly changing positions on the matter. The news first broke on Lifezette however, the focus on cartels was downplayed in their coverage as an idea that is being “mulled over. ” Trump's campaign is now led by Stephen Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News who stepped down temporarily to run the campaign. Breitbart Texas' Cartel Chronicles project began under Bannon's leadership and the issue is dear to his heart. The project allows clandestine citizen journalists in several Mexican states that are under direct control from Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel to have a platform to expose the evils of the transnational criminal groups and has a stated goal of warring with the criminals and exposing them for the purpose of ending them. In addition to providing a voice to the courageous citizen journalists in Mexico, the project singles out cartel commanders one by one and focuses media attention on them until the Mexican authorities are forced to act and go after the criminal boss, thus picking them off one at a time. Bannon   and presided over the project until he went to the Trump campaign and someone with his knowledge on the cartels leading the campaign makes it inevitable that Trump wouldn't also have the Mexican cartels on his mind each day —  along with the grief of the loved ones of the cartels' countless victims.

18271,37012,Blue State Blues: 10 Things That Journalists Did Wrong in 2016,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"This week has seen a good deal of   by the Fourth Estate. If you want to know what went wrong in journalism in 2016, Harvard's traditional election postmortem offered a clue. [In addition to senior campaign staffers from each side  —   who fought openly when Clinton's team behaved like sore losers  —   the conference at the Institute of Politics included many journalists  —   but none from Breitbart News, which was one of the few outlets to report accurately what was going on in 2016.  (Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon was included  —   though he did not attend  —   because of his role as the Trump campaign's CEO, not his media role. Bannon, an incoming White House adviser, is currently on leave from Breitbart News.) Journalists recognize they have a problem  —   but they refuse to see what it is, or how to fix it. CNN's Brian Stelter, for one, delivered a heartfelt call for   on morning  —   then smeared Breitbart News as “white nationalist” that evening. Harvard's Nieman Foundation for Journalism also published a   anthology, which has a few insights but is still remarkably clueless. Many of the media contributors seem to think the problem in 2016 was political, not professional  —   i. e. not that they were so wrong about what was happening, but that the wrong outcome took place despite their strenuous efforts. I spent a good deal of time this year thinking about what was wrong with journalism. I had a chance to observe the front rank of the field up close, as I joined the Trump traveling press corps. And I made a few mistakes myself. My conclusions follow. 1. Hello: This is not a new problem. The media have been functioning as an arm of the Democrats for several years. Some are only willing to acknowledge it now because Trump's win was such shock to them, and because many made their partisan loyalties explicit in 2016. But the profession has been corrupt for a long time, and remains so, from top to bottom. 2. Journalists ignored the basics. Who, What, When, Where, Why, How. Journalists were far too busy telling their audience what to think about about the candidates and the issues than to bother with telling them what was actually going on. Not one of the   essays in the Nieman anthology grasps this point. Journalists neglected the basics in favor of punditry. 3. Journalists were blinded by hate. After Trump's final rally in New Hampshire, the country's elite journalists were more interested in whether Tom Brady had really voted for Trump or Bill Belichick had really written him a letter than in the fact that Trump had just made an explicit appeal to   voters, something you almost never see Republicans do. They hated Trump so much that they simply could not listen to what he was saying except to find gaffes with which to punish him. 4. Elitism. Journalists approached this election like a medieval guild defending their place among the privileged. They failed to notice that technological advances have enabled virtually anyone to compete with them, whether as “citizen journalists” or itinerant social media participants. That should have driven professional journalists to prove their skill. Instead, they sulked. They mocked their audience without realizing that their audience now has alternative outlets, and the means to fight back. 5. Little real diversity. Journalists wrote often about the number of white people at Trump rallies. Ironically, the traveling press corps was almost entirely white, with a few exceptions. There was more racial diversity in the crowds than in the media pen. The most important kind of diversity goes beyond color, but neither the media nor the academy wants to know that. 6. Journalists are poor political operators. Once, perhaps, a columnist could hope to affect political outcomes by planting a particular idea, attacking the right target, or appealing to the right people. When I look back at my own mistakes from 2016, my worst was thinking that there was room for compromise between the Trump campaign and its opponents in NeverTrump. Neither side had much interest in finding common ground. It would have been better just to report that than to try to solve it. 7. The media are terrible at predictions. This is one point that some of the Neiman contributors understand. Journalists kept saying there was no chance Trump could win. Now they look like fools. We in the conservative media learned our lesson in 2012. The difference is we remembered it. Mainstream journalists failed to predict 2014, and had learned nothing by 2016. 8. The media lost interest in the story. Journalists had convinced each other that Trump had no chance of winning (see #7) so they treated the final weeks of the campaign like a death march, rather than high drama. Not even commercial   could motivate the media to describe the contest as the exciting historical clash that it was. They said it was over. Too soon. 9. Laziness. Journalists borrow too many words, ideas, and labels from each other without thinking. The sort of intellectual vacuity that allows the media to attach a phrase like “white nationalist” to Breitbart News  —   all of a sudden, after the election  —   is not only defamatory, but also reinforces the barrier between the media and the reality beyond. In addition, the social media temptation has also become an obsession: many journalists spend too much time on Twitter and too little time working. 10. The cone of silence. The rule in the traveling press corps was that everything that was said, and even everything that happened, among the journalists was off the record. It's a new rule  —   David Halberstam's The Unfinished Odyssey of Robert Kennedy, about the 1968 campaign, would not have been a classic without press anecdotes, which he reported discreetly but powerfully. There's a value to keeping some things off the record  —   even journalists need privacy  —   but the fact is that media memes are manufactured in that cone of silence, including false ones. The public has a right to know that, and to know how. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

He also pointed that in many ways men suffer more than women as a result of a patriarchal society. “Men are the casualties of war, the vast majority of suicides, and practically everyone killed on the job. ” “Yes, that's right, there's actually a death gap, and it massively favors women. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that men make up 92 percent  —   92 percent!  —   of workplace deaths. That's real gender inequality. ” Written from prepared remarks.

18511,37252,Farage: 'Hillary Brings Stability... Of Failure',Breitbart,Victoria Friedman,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Outgoing UKIP leader Nigel Farage told Breitbart News Daily that Clinton “represents the status quo” and will bring “the stability of failure” to the USA if she wins the presidential election this November. [Speaking to Breitbart London's    Raheem Kassam, the outgoing UKIP leader and Member of the European Parliament (MEP) Nigel Farage has stated that Democratic presidential nominee Clinton, along with the rest of the global political establishment “have led us into a series of wars, they've massively increased our levels of debt, and they represent failure”.  He continued: “When Hillary talks about stability, what she means is the stability of failure. The stability of policies that haven't worked, and what the West needs is a change. ” “Hillary and her mates are part of the global politics of the last twenty years that has been absolutely    with the big banks and big multinational businesses that have led to the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. Ordinary people in America, Britain, and elsewhere are not being given an even break. ” Remarking on the fact that Clinton had neither met with American voters nor held a press conference for over 270 days, Mr. Farage said: “What she is doing is very simple. She is saying: ‘I represent the status quo' ‘I represent the world the way it is' ‘I represent safety' and effectively nothing much will change under me. ” Mr. Farage's comments come after Front National leader and presidential candidate for the 2017 French elections Marine Le Pen said that a Clinton presidency would mean “devastation” in an interview with CNN: “I believe Clinton means war, Clinton means devastation, destabilizing the world, economic choices that would be devastating for my people, geostrategic choices that would lead to global conflicts,” Ms. Le Pen said. The populist leader then drew parallels between her campaign and that of Mr. Trump saying “we're not insiders, we are not taking part in the ‘system' we depend on no one and do not take our orders from any financial institutions”."

18716,37457,FBI: ISIS and Al-Qaeda Inspired Ohio State Attacker,Breitbart,Edwin Mora,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"The Somali college student who used a vehicle and a butcher knife to attack people at Ohio State University (OSU) this week was inspired by the ISIS ( ) and deceased     cleric Anwar   according to the FBI. [“At this time, we are not aware of anyone else being involved in the planning of this attack, but the investigation continues,” said Angela L. Byers, the special agent in charge of the FBI office in Cincinnati, reported the NY Times (NYT). “It appears that [the attacker Abdul Razak Ali Artan] may have at least been inspired by Anwar Awlaki and the ISIS. ”  Citing two unnamed law enforcement sources, CNN added, “The sources point to Abdul Razak Ali Artan's Facebook posts before his   rampage on the Columbus campus. The posts referenced Awlaki, who was a leader of al Qaeda in Yemen. Sources also note the style of the attack was encouraged by ISIS in a recent online magazine. ” Artan injured 11 people before he was shot dead by law enforcement. Although ISIS considers   to be its rival, various ISIS members and other Sunni jihadists have been known to be fans of Awlaki. The U. S. government executed Awlaki, but his propaganda has inspired some domestic attacks in the USA in the years after his death. Artan, a permanent U. S. resident born in Somalia, praised the radical     cleric as a “hero” in a Facebook rant he posted just minutes before ramming his car into a cluster of pedestrians and then slashing some of them with a butcher knife Monday morning. “I am sick and tired of seeing [Muslims] killed  tortured everywhere,” he added, according to media reports. “If you want us Muslims to stop carrying lone wolf attacks, then make peace,” Artan also wrote. “We will not let you sleep unless you give peace to the Muslims. Despite ISIS claiming responsibility for the attack, investigators believe it was a lone wolf attack. Investigators are going through “the detailed analysis of electronic devices, social media accounts and other materials” linked to Artan and “have conducted dozens of interviews with family members,   neighbors and others,” noted Byers from the FBI. Artan spent seven years in Pakistan, a terrorist breeding ground, before entering the USA as a refugee in 2014. Dr. Andrew Thomas, chief medical officer of the OSU Wexner Medical Center, told reporters that of the 11 people wounded by the terrorist, three remain hospitalized."
18727,37468,Farage: The West Needs A 'Democratic Renaissance' To Put The People Back In Charge,Breitbart,Victoria Friedman,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Talking on Breitbart News Daily this morning, UKIP MEP Nigel Farage told host and Breitbart London    Raheem Kassam that the West needs a “democratic renaissance” in order to put the people back in power. [Mr. Farage, who was the singular most powerful voice in the Leave campaign and led Britain to a Brexit victory, remarked:  “What the West needs is a democratic renaissance where we actually put people back in charge of their own lives. ” The Leave result in the referendum for Britain to leave the EU (EU) was seen as a victory for democracy and populist will. However, the outgoing UKIP leader remarked on the Democratic hopeful's reaction to the referendum result: “Hillary thinks Brexit is one of the worst things that ever happened because she supports these giant attempts of government  —   effectively  —   on almost on a global scale. ” Following the Leave result, Clinton warned against America likewise embracing the nationalistic, populist tone that fueled the Leave vote in Britain. More recently she and her close advisor accused Mr. Farage of “ ” “extreme nationalism” and UKIP of being funded directly by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr. Farage responded to these accusations as “slanderous” commenting that: “If anyone stoops to the level of using the epithet ‘far right' to describe people who believe in   democracy, well clearly they are the ones that have lost the plot, not me. ” “I've never worked with groups on the extreme right or left. At the end of the day I'm someone that has come from business into politics and my motivation was that I thought the European project was taking away from my country democracy, free speech, the ability to control out borders. “What I realise now, years on, was that what I saw going on in my country wasn't unique to us it actually has been happening in the [entire] Western world. ” In an exclusive with Breitbart London, Dutch populist politician Geert Wilders discussed the rising ‘Patriot Spring' noting that in Europe and America “revolutions are brewing. “They are peaceful and democratic, but they are going to send the elites home that are running our nations into the ground. ”"

Sanders said, “I do not think that every single Trump supporter is racist. But it is  —   we have to be real and understand that the populism around Trump's campaign was intrinsically tied to racism. it was intrinsically tied to making people that were not white   people the other.

19913,38658,Explosion Rocks SpaceX Launch Site in Florida During Test - Breitbart,Breitbart,Breitbart Tech,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  —   A massive explosion rocked a SpaceX launch pad Thursday during a routine rocket test for a planned weekend launch. [There were no injuries, but the rocket and the satellite onboard were destroyed, SpaceX said in a statement.  The company was conducting a test firing of its unmanned Falcon rocket when the blast occurred shortly after 9 a. m. The test was in advance of a planned Saturday launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, which is next to NASA's Kennedy Space Center. It was supposed to hoist an Israeli communications satellite. SpaceX said that in preparation for Thursday's engine firing  —   a test carried out a few days before every launch  —   “there was an anomaly on the pad resulting in the loss of the vehicle and its payload. ” There were no additional details provided. It's the same kind of SpaceX rocket used to launch space station supplies for NASA, and represented a major setback for the space agency's plans for future cargo hauls and, ultimately, astronaut flights. Buildings several miles away shook from the blast, and multiple explosions continued for several minutes. Dark smoke filled the overcast sky. A   later, a black cloud hung low across the eastern horizon. TV cameras showed smoke coming from the launch pad two hours later. The rocket was still standing, although the top third or so was clearly bent over. The explosion occurred at Launch Complex 40 at the Air Force station, right next door to Kennedy Space Center. NASA said Kennedy emergency staff was on standby. At the same time, personnel were monitoring the air for any toxic fumes. The Air Force stressed there was no threat to public safety in the surrounding communities. The initial blast sent   NASA employees rushing frantically outside to see what happened. At first, it sounded like lightning, but was followed by the sounds of more explosions, then more and more. SpaceX is one of two companies shipping supplies to the International Space Station for NASA. It's also working on a crew capsule to ferry station U. S. astronauts that first flight was supposed to come as early as next year. Two NASA astronauts were conducting a spacewalk 250 miles up, outside the International Space Station, when the explosion occurred. Mission Control did not notify them of the accident, saying all communication was focused on the spacewalk. The explosion is a major blow for SpaceX  —   and also for NASA, which relies on the company to keep the space station equipped with food, science experiments and other supplies. The   company, led by billionaire Elon Musk, had been ramping up with frequent launches to make up for a backlog created by a launch accident in June 2015. SpaceX was leasing the pad from the Air Force for its Falcon launches. The company is also redoing a former shuttle pad at Kennedy for future manned flights for NASA."

20354,39100,Ten Unanswered Questions About the Refugee Resettlement Program and Somali Attacker at Ohio State - Breitbart,Breitbart,Michael Patrick Leahy,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"The story of Abdul Razak Ali Artan's two and a half years in the USA reveals the many weaknesses of the federal refugee resettlement program. [Breitbart News has put together a list of ten unanswered questions about Artan, the Somali refugee who on Monday attacked eleven people on the campus of Ohio State University, first with a car and then with a knife, before he was shot and killed by a campus police officer.  (1) How and why did Abdul Razak Ali Artan, his mother, and six siblings suddenly leave the supervision of Catholic Charities of Dallas in Texas and move to Columbus, Ohio after only 23 days in the USA? Catholic Charities of Dallas has confirmed that they  provided “shelter, clothing, and other basic humanitarian services for a short time in 2014” to “an individual whose name matches the name of [an Artan] family member. ” That assistance began on June 5, 2014, when the family arrived at the   Worth airport, from Pakistan via JFK Airport in NY. It continued for 23 days until June 28, 2014, when the entire family departed for Columbus, Ohio. Resettlement and Placement grants provide about $1, 900 to local resettlement agencies to cover the lodging, food, and other expenses for the first 90 days in the USA per refugee. The resettlement agencies typically keep about $800 of each refugee's funds for themselves, and provide $1, 100 in cash assistance to each refugee, usually spread out over the   period. If that standard arrangement was applied to the eight members of the Artan family, Catholic Charities of Dallas may have received an estimated $15, 200 in Resettlement and Placement grant monies by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to resettle the family ($1, 900 per family member) in Texas for 90 days. It is unclear how much may have been paid directly to the Artan family, how much may have been retained by Catholic Charities of Dallas, and how much may have been returned to the Office of Refugee Resettlement. (2) Who paid for the travel of Abdul Razak Ali Artan, his mother, and six siblings, from Dallas, Texas to Columbus, Ohio on June 28, 2014? It is not surprising that the Artan family would want to resettle in Columbus, Ohio, which has the second largest Somali community in the USA, estimated to be about 45, 000 in total. (Minneapolis, Minnesota, has the largest Somali community in the country, estimated to be around 70, 000 in total.) It is surprising, however, that a   family of eight Somali refugees without any known resources would have the funds to travel from Dallas, Texas to Columbus, Ohio. Breitbart News has contacted all three of the local resettlement agencies in the Columbus, Ohio area, and they all deny providing Artan and his family financial assistance. (3) Why has Catholic Charities of Dallas failed to confirm it was paid by the federal government's refugee resettlement program to resettle Artan and his family? Catholic Charities of Dallas has not explicitly confirmed that it had a contractual obligation with the federal government's refugee resettlement program to resettle and monitor the progress of Abdul Razak Ali Artan, his mother, and six siblings. “We gave them aid and comfort and some shelter as part of the government resettlement program,” Catholic Charities of Dallas CEO Dave Woodyard told NBC5 on Tuesday of his organization's dealings with Artan and his family. That same day, Catholic Charities of Dallas released a statement that made no mention of the refugee resettlement program: Catholic Charities of Dallas has been contacted by law enforcement in connection with the investigation into yesterday's events at Ohio State University. We have responded to law enforcement requests for information regarding an individual whose name matches the name of a family member that Catholic Charities provided with shelter, clothing, and other basic humanitarian services for a short time in 2014. The standard procedure for local resettlement agencies under the Cooperative Agreement between the nine national voluntary agencies (VOLAGs) and the ORR is that upon arrival, resettled refugees are provided an apartment, clothing, furniture, pots and pans, and culturally appropriate food for at least 90 days, and are helped to sign up locally for food stamps, welfare benefits, and Social Security cards. Something went wrong 23 days into that initial 90 day period, and Catholic Charities of Dallas is reticent to explain what exactly that was. (4) Who is Abdul Razak Ali Artan's father, and why was he apparently not in the picture for many years? There are no media reports concerning Abdul Razak Ali Artan's father. Every article mentions only his mother and six siblings. Did Artan's father travel with the family to Pakistan from Somalia in 2007, or did Artan, his mother and six siblings make that arduous trip on their own? Breitbart News has learned through the State Department's interactive website that on June 5, 2014 a total of nine Somali refugees arrived in Dallas, Texas. Assuming this accurately captured the arrival of the eight members of the Artan family who are known to us. Breitbart News has asked Catholic Charities of Dallas to reveal the identity and current status of this ninth Somali refugee, but has not received a response. (5) Why did Artan, his mother, and six siblings not apply for and receive asylum in Pakistan when they arrived there in 2007 from Somalia, as NBC News has reported? The simple answer to this question appears to be that Pakistan is not as welcoming of Somali refugees as is the USA. The unanswered part of the question is why the USA has not asked Pakistan to be more welcoming of Somali refugees. “Somalis living in Pakistan have limited rights mainly because Pakistan has not ratified the 1951 UN Refugee Convention. They are not eligible to take up permanent residence here they cannot do any business or move around the country freely. Unless they are registered as refugees with UNHCR [the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] their stay in Pakistan remains illegal, ” according to The Herald. Pakistan is a country of 192 million, almost all of whom (96 percent) are Muslim. The small Somali community in Pakistan, estimated to number between 400 and 4, 000 in total, is almost entirely Muslim. More than   percent of the 100, 009 Somali refugees who have arrived in the USA since 2002 (99, 672 in total) are Muslim, according to the Department of State's interactive website, while about one percent of Americans are Muslim, according to Pew Research. Kevin Stankiewicz, who interviewed Artan in August for The Lantern, the Ohio State student newspaper, told the NY Times, “Mr. Artan spoke highly of his time in Pakistan. ” Culturally, eight Muslim refugees from Somalia would appear to have far less trouble assimilating in Pakistan than in the USA, but Somalis who live there are apparently unhappy with their treatment. The Express Tribune, for instance, reported in 2011: “Hundreds of Somali refugees, mainly women and children, assembled in front of Social and Assistance Centre (SACH) in Islamabad on Thursday and protested against what they described as injustice, deliberate negligence, and discrimination against them. ” “Our needs of protection, education, healthcare and asylum are still unresolved,” the protest placards read. “All of my children were born here. But I have nothing to feed them. I do not have enough support and can't even go back,” an unidentified Somali mother of three living in Pakistan told The Express Tribune. Somali refugees in Pakistan are considered problematic by at least one United Nations official. “Somali refugees are the most difficult to deal with. They are easily manipulated towards criminal activities, making it difficult to negotiate with them at times,” a United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees official in Pakistan told the Express Tribune in 2012. Newsweek recently reported that Pakistan is deporting thousands of Afghan refugees back to   Afghanistan. (6) Why was the Artan family's application to come to the USA through the federal refugee resettlement program approved in 2014 by an officer of the USA Citizenship Immigration Services, part of the Department of Homeland Security, after the family spent seven years in Pakistan? Though Somali refugees in Pakistan apparently have a difficult economic existence, they are not fleeing physical persecution experienced in that country. Many of the Somali refugees who live there wish to emigrate to the USA or another country in the West. Very few of them are approved by the USA Citizenship Immigration Services (USCIS) to participate in the federal refugee resettlement program. Breitbart News has asked the USCIS what uniquely qualified Abdul Razak Ali Artan, his mother, and six siblings to be accepted into the federal refugee resettlement while many other Somali refugees living in Pakistan have not been accepted. USCIS has not responded to the inquiry. “This seven year stay in Pakistan by Artan and his family seems very fishy to me. Pakistan is a safe haven for Muslim refugees. The refugee camps there are also well known breeding grounds for Islamic terrorism,” Ann Corcoran of Refugee Resettlement Watch tells Breitbart News. (7) Has the Artan family repaid the estimated $5, 200 loan they received from the federal government to fly one way from Pakistan to Dallas, Texas on June 5, 2014? All refugees who arrive in the USA under the federal refugee resettlement program are required to sign a loan agreement to repay the cost of their flight to the USA. According to Travelocity. com, the cheapest one way flights from Karachi, Pakistan to Dallas, Texas currently cost around $650 per person. For eight people, the cost would be approximately $5, 200. If the Artan family arrived in the USA in compliance with the rules and regulations of the federal refugee resettlement program, they would have signed a promissory note for about $5, 200 to repay their travel expenses. Both ORR and Catholic Charities of Dallas would have a copy of that note, as well as the progress the Artan family has made in repaying that loan. Neither ORR nor Catholic Charities of Dallas have responded to a request from Breitbart News to provide that information. (8) How old was Abdul Razak Ali Artan? Was he 18, as some press outlets report, or was he 20, as others report? Some media outlets have reported Abdul Razak Ali Artan was 18. Other media outlets have reported his age was 20. The Daily Mail notes that the photograph taken of Artan by The Lantern in August 2016 shows a balding man with a goatee who looks much older than 18. “The uncertainty over Artan's age simply illustrates the impossibility of properly vetting a Somali refugee family that spent seven years in Pakistan,” Refugee Resettlement Watch's Corcoran says. “The people responsible for vetting Artan and his family in Pakistan had no reliable data base to verify any claim made by Artan, his mother, or his siblings. In essence, they simply took their word for it on almost every aspect of the family's history, including dates of birth. ” (9) Once the Artan family arrived in Columbus, Ohio in June 2014, upon what income did they rely for their survival? Abdul Razak Ali Artan, his mother, and six siblings apparently arrived in Columbus, Ohio shortly after June 28, 2014. There are no press reports that his mother was employed. Artan himself was a full time student, first at Columbus State Community College, then at Ohio State University, from the fall of 2014 to his death on Monday. Press reports indicate that he worked a   job at a Home Depot store near his home in Columbus for about a year. Besides that part time job, there is no other indication that anyone in Artan's family was employed. Breitbart News asked Jon Keeling, director of communication for the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services how much total financial support Abdul Razak Ali Artan, his mother, and his six siblings received from the federal government and the state of Ohio between June 2014 and November 2016. Breitbart News also asked if   refugees who became secondary migrants to Ohio were eligible to receive food stamps, welfare payments, and other financial assistance. “I received your two questions,” Keeling told Breitbart News. “Unfortunately I cannot answer your first one. We do not discuss individuals,” he said. “As for the second, first I'm assuming by ‘secondary migrant' you mean that the individual lawfully resettled in one state and then lawfully moved to Ohio,” Keeling responded.  “Given that, here is the answer, and please note these are all federal requirements you would find in any other state:” Is a single adult refugee or a secondary migrant eligible for cash and food assistance? SNAP: A refugee would be a “qualified alien” (a federal term referring to a pool of  . S. citizens who meet the SNAP citizenship requirement) that would be eligible to receive SNAP benefits, provided all other eligibility requirements are met. Cash Assistance: A refugee whose entry date is within 8 months of the application date and who meets application and income requirements may be eligible to receive Refugee Cash Assistance for up to 8 months from the date of arrival. “A refugee may also be eligible for cash assistance through an Ohio program called OhioWorks,” Keeling added in a subsequent email. “This is for parents at 50% of the federal poverty level and who have at least one child under the age of 18. The refugee may also be eligible for federal SSI if he or she has a qualifying disability. Obviously we do not administer this program. ” “Each of these programs do not have time limits,” Keeling said. According to reference. com, “Welfare payments vary by state, but the average family of four in the USA can receive as much as $900 per month. A single person may receive as much as $200 per month. ” In Ohio, the average food stamp benefits per person are about $122 per month. In addition, refugees are eligible for federal rental assistance. “Upon arrival in the USA, refugees are eligible to apply for all public assistance program including Medicaid, food stamps, public housing, SSI and cash welfare. Within a week to 10 days after arrival, VOLAGs are required to assist refugees in applying for a social security number, food stamps, cash and medical assistance which can be cash welfare and Medicaid, or the special Refugee Cash and Medical Assistance subsidies,” an attorney familiar with the federal refugee resettlement program tells Breitbart News. “Even if a refugee receives the   special subsidies, if they become eligible for cash welfare   Medicaid after the 8 months, they may reapply for these publicly funded benefits,” the attorney adds. “With regard to this particular family it is difficult to estimate the amount and extent of public assistance they accessed but one can assume that a single mother and her seven children, newly arrived, met the various program eligibility requirements. The five year survey on refugee welfare usage across programs shows high sustained levels of reliance on publicly funded programs,” the attorney concludes. (10) Who paid for Abdul Razak Ali Artan's tuition from the fall of 2014 to May 2016 at Columbus State Community College and from August 2016 to November 2016 at Ohio State University? It is not currently known who paid for Artan's college tuition. It is known that he enrolled in Columbus State Community College in the fall of 2014, though it is unclear if he had a high school diploma earned in Pakistan prior to his acceptance. Columbus State Community College released this statement on Tuesday: “Abdul Razak Ali Artan was enrolled at Columbus State Community College from autumn semester 2014 through summer semester 2016. He graduated with an Associate of Arts degree in the spring of 2016 and then took a   class for summer 2016. He had no record of behavioral or disciplinary issues during his time at Columbus State —  he graduated Cum Laude.   Kraus, Vice President, Marketing and Communications” Artan enrolled as a third year student at Ohio State in August 2016. He was majoring in logistics, but enrolled in at least one social science course. On Thursday, Reason Magazine reported that Artan “was enrolled in a class called ‘Crossing Identity Boundaries. '” There remain several additional unanswered questions about Abdul Razak Ali Artan's two and a half years in the USA that ended with his violent attacks and death on the campus of Ohio State Monday. That attack, another in a long string of terrorist attacks by Muslim migrants on American soil, provides yet another reason why   Trump is expected to follow through on his campaign promise to pause the entry of refugees from Syria and other countries that are hostile to the USA into our country."
20421,39167,"Presidential Debates Should Include Libertarian Gary Johnson, Say 52 Percent of Voters - Breitbart",Breitbart,Neil Munro,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"  percent of registered voters want libertarian candidate Gary Johnson to be included in the presidential TV debates, according to a survey by Morning Consult. [Johnson is very unlikely to get a seat, because his highest polling score has been around 13 percent, and he's now struggling around 8 percent.  The committee of D. C. insiders which set the rules for the debate has decided to invite only people with at least 15 percent support in the polls. The presidential debates are scheduled for Sept. 26, Oct. 4 and Oct. 9. Johnson's exclusion is probably good for Clinton, because most of his voters would pick her as their second choice. He favors   immigration and socially liberal policies.

20483,39229,Facebook Announces AI Program to Flag Offensive Content in Live Streams - Breitbart,Breitbart,Lucas Nolan,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Facebook has announced it is developing an artificial intelligence program in order to analyse and flag offensive live streaming videos. [Reuters reports that Facebook is expanding their existing automatic image detection system, which is used to flag nudity or offensive imagery in photos and provide facial detection functionalities, to include Facebook Live videos. Facebook's director of Applied Machine Learning, Joaquin Candela, said the current system is “an algorithm that detects nudity, violence, or any of the things that are not according to our policies. ”  Facebook began using similar software to flag offensive video content back in June, but the company is just now implementing the feature in its live video streaming service. The artificial intelligence being used to flag the content in live videos is still in its experimental stage and has a few obstacles to overcome before it's fully functional.  Candela discussed some of the problems the program faces, saying,  “One, your computer vision algorithm has to be fast, and I think we can push there, and the other one is you need to prioritize things in the right way so that a human looks at it, an expert who understands our policies, and takes it down. ” Facebook stated that the automation process won't be entirely automatic. It has been used to process tens of millions of user reports each week, but these reports are forwarded on to a Facebook reviewer with the appropriate subject matter expertise to decide whether or not the content should be deleted. Supposedly Facebook's live video flagging process will work in a similar manner. Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart Tech covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

20486,39232,Chris Brown Releases Song After Arrest: 'What Would You Do?' - Breitbart,Breitbart,Breitbart News,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"NY (AFP)  —   Troubled singer Chris Brown has released a song shortly after his arrest for allegedly threatening a woman  —   and the lyrics may obliquely take aim at her. [Brown, who was released on $250, 000 bail, late Wednesday put out for free a dance track entitled “What Would You Do?”  Set to an infectious electronic beat, Brown addresses an unnamed person as he says that he “needs some answers  —   answers from you. ” “What do you do fighting for your life? And no one's on your side,” he sings. “Yeah baby, I can't stand to lose you   See, you're in too deep   And no, nowhere to hide. ” Police headed to Brown's palatial Los Angeles home early Tuesday after Baylee Curran, the winner of the Miss California Regional contest, said that the singer pointed a gun at her. Brown, 27, kept the officers waiting for hours as he demanded they produce a warrant and denounced police brutality in a series of   Instagram videos. Curran said that she had partied previously with Brown and that he grew angry after she admired a piece of jewelry. Brown has been as well known in recent years for violent incidents and legal   as for his music. Most notoriously, he pleaded guilty in 2009 to beating up pop star Rihanna, his then girlfriend, ahead of the Grammy Awards. "
20714,39460,7 Things to Know About Secretary of Defense Nominee James Mattis,Breitbart,John Hayward,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Retired Marine General James N. Mattis, named on Thursday as   Trump's choice for Secretary of Defense, is a    figure with a fascinating career. Following are some choice details from his biography, and some lines of attack the Trump team might want to be on guard against. [1. His nicknames include “Chaos,” “Mad Dog,” and “The Warrior Monk. ” The most commonly used of these nicknames is “Mad Dog”  —   Trump even called him that when announcing his nomination!  —   but according to a profile at NBC News, he dislikes that moniker. According to the L. A. Times, his troops began referring to him as Mad Dog Mattis “behind his back” after the battle of Fallujah, intending the name as “high praise. ”   As for his other nicknames, “Warrior Monk” is an allusion to his voracious reading habits, combined with the fact that he has never been married, while “Chaos” was his call sign. Mattis has also reportedly said that Chaos stands for “Colonel Has An Outstanding Solution. ” 2. His military career spanned four decades. Mattis retired as a   general and head of U. S. Central Command in 2013, after 41 years of service. He is now 66 years old. He was born in Washington State and attended Central Washington University, receiving a commission as a second lieutenant the year after he graduated. His awards include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, and the Bronze Star “with a combat distinguishing device and a combat action ribbon, awarded for   fighting,” as the Associated Press has described the award. After   Mattis led “the deepest insertion of Marines into a combat zone in U. S. history” in Afghanistan, followed by “the longest sustained march in Marine Corps history” in Iraq. Mattis literally wrote the book on modern counterinsurgency operations, along with one of the definitive books on operational command. After retiring from the military, he became a fellow at the Hoover Institution and kept writing. 3. He is a scholar of warfare. Mattis at one point accumulated over 7, 000 books, before giving many of them away or donating them to libraries. As of 2013, the San Diego Union Tribune reported that he had never owned a television set. The NY Times stated in a 2010 profile that Mattis devoted most of his moving allowance to hauling his books around. He never went into battle without his copy of The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. “It allows me to distance myself from the here and now,” he explained. His interest in Native American history and culture, dating back to his youth in Washington, is legendary. “He was once asked which American Indian warrior he most respected. His answer was a       exposition spanning the first Seminole war to the surrender of the Lakota,” the NY Times recalled. “Read about history, and you become aware that nothing starts with us,” Mattis reflected in a recent interview with Military History. “It started long ago. If you read enough biography and history, you learn how people have dealt successfully or unsuccessfully with similar situations or patterns in the past. It doesn't give you a template of answers, but it does help you refine the questions you have to ask yourself. Further, you recognize there is nothing so unique that you've got to go to extraordinary lengths to deal with it. ” During the course of that interview, Mattis was asked what sits atop his reading list. His reply: Colin Gray from the University of Reading is the most   strategist alive. Then there's Sir Hew Strachan from Oxford, and Williamson Murray, the American. Those three are probably the leading   military theorists. You've got to know   and Carl von Clausewitz, of course. The Army was always big on Clausewitz, the Prussian the Navy on Alfred Thayer Mahan, the American and the Air Force on Giulio Douhet, the Italian. But the Marine Corps has always been more  . I am much more comfortable with   and his approach to warfare. 4. He is “the most revered Marine general in at least a generation. ” So said the Military Times in a 2013 profile, attributing the deep respect for Mattis to his frank, endlessly quotable speaking style, his battlefield success, the confidence he always expressed in    service members, and his insistence upon sharing the hardships of his men. A Slate piece on Mathis from 2010 noted that 17 of the 29 members of the platoon he traveled with in Iraq were killed or wounded during a   period in 2004. A photo of the unit is said to be among his prized possessions. “He has imprinted an entire generation of Marines with regard to engaged, decisive combat leadership. As Marines, we could never have been better served by his command,” Col. Brennan Byrne, now chief of staff for the 1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade, told the Military Times.  “The general has inspired a stream of fan mail from fellow Marines, supplications from jailed young veterans, imprudent tattoos, passages in history books, satirical online spoofs, even a television character,” the San Diego Union Tribune noted. (Mattis appeared in several episodes of the 2008 HBO   Generation Kill, portrayed by actor Robert John Burke.) One of the best illustrations of the bond between Mattis and his men comes from 1998, when Marine Commandant Charles Krulak visited the Marine command at Quantico, Virginia to deliver cookies on Christmas. (Krulak and his wife baked the cookies themselves  —   he's a remarkable man, too.)  To his amazement, Krulak found   General Mattis was the duty officer, spending the night on a cot in the back room. “Jim, what are you standing the duty for?” Krulak recalled asking. “Sir, I looked at the duty roster for today and there was a young major who had it who is married and had a family and so I'm a bachelor, I thought why should the major miss out on the fun of having Christmas with his family, and so I took the duty for him,” Mattis replied. 5. Serious efforts were made to recruit him as a 2016 presidential candidate. The movement was described in the Daily Beast as a “Plan B,” hatched by a group of conservative billionaires, to run Mattis as a   candidate after Trump secured the Republican nomination. A package of strategic memos outlining ways he could win the race was reportedly sent to Mattis. There is no indication Mattis himself took this effort very seriously. In fact, the Daily Beast noted that when Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol proposed a presidential run at a Hoover Institute fundraiser in February, Mattis popped up from the back of the room and shouted, “No way!” Undaunted, Kristol kept talking up the possibility, and Mattis kept dismissing it as “idle chatter. ” A less organized effort to draft him as a presidential candidate was made in 2012, and a petition was circulated in 2014 to make him Secretary for Veterans Affairs. “Gen. Mattis is the most competent general officer of his generation and a natural leader. There is no better individual to lead the VA along the path of needed change,” the petition declared. 6. He'll need a special waiver to serve as Secretary of Defense. A law dating back to 1947 stipulates a minimum   waiting period between active military duty and serving as Secretary of Defense, which is a civilian position. Mattis has only been retired for three years. CNN reported in late November, when Mattis became the favorite contender for SecDef, that the House Armed Services Committee was investigating the steps needed to secure a waiver for him.  There is precedent, as General George Marshall was appointed Secretary of Defense by President Harry Truman in 1950 only five years after he retired from the Army, at a time when the waiting period was even longer, a minimum of 10 years. The waiver must come from Congress, which seems generally   to Mattis. Senate Armed Services Committee chairman John McCain ( ) praised the nominee on Monday as “one of the finest military officers of his generation, and an extraordinary leader,” expressing hope that he has “an opportunity to serve America again. ” The Trump transition team has expressed confidence that McCain will back a waiver for Mattis. However, Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of NY, who is a ranking member on Senate Armed Services, declared on Thursday that she would oppose a waiver. “Civilian control of our military is a fundamental principle of American democracy, and I will not vote for an exception to this rule. ” As of Friday afternoon, Gillibrand was the only senator to declare firm opposition. Politico notes that Gillibrand, or any other senator, can force a supermajority vote to pass a waiver for Mattis, which would oblige Republican leadership in the Senate to find at least eight Democratic votes in favor. Politico further notes that several   political groups have begun making noise about blocking Mattis' nomination. 7. His career is not devoid of controversy. There are some items on Mattis' resume that will probably be used against him, if Democrats decide to dig in and block his nomination, or at least seek to exact a political price from   Trump and the Republicans. Mattis himself would recommend studying adversarial tactics closely, so here are some attacks that might be coming his way: His famously bold speaking style landed him in a bit of hot water in 2005, when he said it was “a hell of a lot of fun” to shoot the Taliban, who “slap women around for five years because they didn't wear a veil. ” Marine Commandant Gen. Michael Hagee was simultaneously supportive of Mattis, and of the opinion that he “should have chosen his words more carefully. ” While many readers of this quintessential Mattisism may regard it as evidence that he belongs in the Badass Hall of Fame, it should be noted that there were calls to discipline him for his remarks at the time.  “We do not need generals who treat the grim business of war as a sporting event. These disturbing remarks are indicative of an apparent indifference to the value of human life,” said executive director Nihad Awad of the Council on   Relations (CAIR) for example. CAIR has been declared a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates and was named by federal prosecutors as an unindicted   in a   operation. Mattis was also attacked in 2004 for an operation in Mukaradeeb, Iraq that was described as the massacre of a wedding party by critics. The U. S. military said its forces came under fire, and returned fire. “How many people go to the middle of the desert to hold a wedding 80 miles from the nearest civilization? These were more than two dozen   males. Let's not be naive,” Mattis said at the time. People on the Left still cite the “Mukaradeeb Wedding Party Massacre” as evidence that Mattis is a homicidal maniac. The   “  movement,” of course, went into a hypocritical coma when Obama became president, but they will be emerging from hibernation soon. A third line of criticism that may emerge against Mattis is of more recent vintage, and it has nothing to do with his military career: he is one of several big political names listed on the board of directors of Theranos, a medical testing company whose signature technological breakthrough did not work.  The Theranos story is long and unpleasant, but in essence, it is a story of political connections and corporate star power overriding good business sense. Mattis played a role in attempting to persuade the military to use Theranos test equipment, by all indications sincerely believing it was revolutionary technology.  Other big names, such as former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and George Shultz, are stepping away from the company, superstar CEO Elizabeth Holmes has been censured by the U. S. government, and both customers and investors are working on fraud lawsuits.  "
20770,39516,YouTubers in Uproar After Company Notifies Them of Advertising Policy Violations - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ben Kew,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Some of YouTube's biggest stars are complaining that the company is removing revenue generating  from their videos for violating YouTube's guidelines. [YouTubers Philip DeFranco, MrRepzion, and Exurb1a have made videos claiming that the channel has pulled advertising revenues from some videos on their channels.   They claim that they have had their advertising revenue pulled as a result of YouTube's policy about what the company deems as appropriate for advertising. According to YouTube's advertising guidelines, it says that content that should be considered “not advertiser friendly” includes anything with “sexually suggest content,” “violence,” “inappropriate language,” as well as anything discussing “controversial or sensitive subjects and events. ” Both Philip DeFranco and MrRepzion could be deemed to have breached these guidelines, with DeFranco publishing a video about Chris Brown's police standoff and MrRepzion's discussing subjects such as mental health, depression, and suicide. Many other stars on the platform have similarly expressed outrage over the lost revenue and the seemingly bizarre standards, with the hashtag #YouTubePartyIsOver trending on Twitter: Here's a video where I talk about Suicide Prevention and its flagged.

Gizmodo reports: According to a YouTube spokesperson, there has been no policy or enforcement change put in place by the platform. Instead, the outrage expressed by DeFranco and others appears to be caused by a chance to notifications. Now YouTubers are receiving emails about videos that have been unmonetized. In the past, YouTubers would have to go into an individual video's analytics to see it had been unmonetized by the platform. It seems clear the platform is trying to be more transparent in notifying users through    notifications and an appeals process, though it's galling to think these things weren't in place already.

The Financial Times reports: Although it is not clear if the Trump transition team intended the conversation to signal a broader change in US policy towards Taiwan, the call is likely to infuriate Beijing which regards the island as a renegade province. The US has adopted the   “One China” policy since 1972 after the   meetings and in 1978 President Jimmy Carter formally recognized Beijing as the sole government of China, with the US embassy closing in Taipei the year after.

All current and former members of the military were asked to stand during the second quarter of the   game, and were honored for their service amidst the 47, 407 people in attendance. During halftime, six veterans of the Vietnam War were specifically honored. The lights went out in the stadium, a flag was unfurled over a portion of the middle of the field, and fans held up cell phone lights.  Kaepernick took to Instagram last July in response to the Alton Sterling shooting in Louisiana, posting the inflammatory words, “This is what lynchings look like in 2016!” Last Sunday, the quarterback told reporters he will continue to sit: “When there's significant change and I feel like that flag represents what it's supposed to represent, this country is representing people the way that it's supposed to, I'll stand. ” He added: People are dying in vain because this country isn't holding their end of the bargain up, as far as giving freedom and justice, liberty to everybody. That's something that's not happening. I've seen videos, I've seen circumstances where men and women that have been in the military have come back and been treated unjustly by the country they have fought for, and have been murdered by the country they fought for, on our land. That's not right. NFL executives, former fans, Kaepernick's own birth mother, former 49ers football star Jerry Rice, and many others have criticized the football player's protest, Kaepernick said last Sunday that he has plans to engage in more activism: “There are things that I have in the works right now that I'm working on to put together in the future and have come to fruition soon. ” He also had harsh words for both major party presidential candidates. When asked, Kaepernick couldn't point to a specific issue that he wanted to see change on to mark a “success. ” In the second half of Thursday night's gameKaepernick did remain standing for God Bless America, and clapped as it concluded.

21828,40575,How Millennials Swung Florida For Trump - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jack Hadfield,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"The youth vote is an often neglected group by those on the conservative side of the political spectrum. However, in this election, whilst millennials still overwhelmingly voted Democrat, Trump secured enough of their support to flip the key swing state of Florida. [Whilst young people are still the ones most likely to be out protesting against the   the more moderate members of their generation may have let the establishment down and cost Clinton the election  —   at least in Florida.  In terms of the national vote, Trump won 37% of the youth vote  —   the exact same percentage Romney received in the last election. However, the Democratic vote share dropped by 5% likely caused by the Democratic party's rejection of Bernie Sanders, who millennials much preferred to Clinton. This rejection of Clinton was seen most starkly in the Sunshine State, with the Democrats winning their support only 54% to 36%  —   a swing of 16 points to the Republicans from 2012. Trump's victory in Florida can largely be attributed therefore to this massive shift in voter preferences because of just how sizeable the youth vote is. Millennials are the fasting growing section of the electorate. In Florida, they represent 20% of the electorate and currently outnumber the   age group. Trump's marginal victory of 1. 3% in Florida equated to approximately 120, 000 votes. If the millennial voting patterns of 2012 had remained the same, Clinton would have taken Florida, and its crucial 29 electors by around 250, 000 votes. Young Republicans in Florida put their success with millennials down to the constant campaigning that they carried out within their own community, rather than any message from the Republicans establishment. “There's more truth and value in focusing get out the vote efforts on millennials using peer to peer methods as opposed to the   approach,” says Lauren Cooley,   of Campus Red PAC, a   youth campaign group run by millennials. “CR PAC was the only organization that launched with this approach, and the youth vote swung the election. We capitalized on this groundswell of support for conservative values in millennials on college campuses, akin to but on a smaller scale, what Trump did nationally as an America First candidate. ” Campus Red PAC was itself responsible for helping over 11, 000 young conservatives get on the electoral register, and reaching around 350, 000 undecided and independent millennial voters with their digital marketing campaign. Jarrett Cathcart, who worked for CR PAC and supported Trump as his candidate from the primaries onwards, told Breitbart News that he felt disappointed with how no conservative groups had figured out how to tap the potential power of the youth vote. “Without CR PAC, Millennials would not have turned out to vote Republican in the astonishing numbers that they did, and Trump would not have won Florida. ” Despite outreach efforts geared to racial minorities, the RNC has not yet funded any programs geared to persuade millennials. “For years, the Republicans and its auxiliaries have largely written off the millennial generation as a lost   we've just proved them wrong,” argued Cade Marsh, the   of Campus Red PAC and Florida Federation of College Republicans state chair. “We were given the freedom and resources we needed to operate on campus without interference from campaigns or the party  —   largely because none of them cared enough to try. ” “We went dorm to dorm, peer to peer, and formed relationships by discussing issues on an individual basis, instead of shaming those who disagreed with us into silence. The key to winning the millennial vote? Treat us as more than a     voting bloc, engage with the issues that matter, and talk to us as peers. No more   syndrome. ” What happens when you don't lose   of the electorate by double digits.

21861,40608,Brazil: Sao Paulo a 'War Zone' after Impeachment,Breitbart,Frances Martel,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"For the third day in a row, leftist agitators stormed Brazil's largest city, Sao Paulo, hurling rocks at police, detonating “homemade bombs” and turning the city's most trafficked streets into a “war zone” to protest the impeachment of leftist former president Dilma Rousseff. [Portugal's Diario de Noticias described Sao Paulo as a “war zone” Wednesday night, highlighting individual instances of violence that exemplified the chaos in the city. Protesters blockaded roads with garbage fires, hurling rocks at police, and detonating homemade bombs near police to prevent them from curbing the mass of protesters.  Folha de Sao Paulo, the city's biggest newspaper, reports seven injuries, four photographers and a policeman among them. At least two of the photographers were hit with shrapnel from the homemade bombs. Two others, lost in the crowd, “were beaten by military police. ” The protesters also appeared to take their wrath out on the media, as some stormed the headquarters of Folha, one caught by a photographer throwing a chair into its entrance.  O Globo, another Brazilian outlet, reports that the protests were not limited to blocking streets and vandalizing media locations. “Bus stops were destroyed, shops attacked and bank branches vandalized,” the newspaper notes. Another injury occurred when a woman trying to drive through the illegal assembly, fearing for her life, tried to drive through the crowd and hit a female agitator. The newspaper notes that police have not estimated the size of the crowd. Police attempted to dispel the crowds with tear gas and water cannons, but were attacked with rocks instead.   Wednesday was the third day such protests occurred, with most media reporting before Wednesday that these protests were significantly smaller than those attracting millions in March in favor in impeachment. The protests this week, organized by a coalition of Brazilian leftist special interest groups, are meant to protest the Senate's vote to impeach Rousseff, finalized Wednesday. The vote means Rousseff will be permanently replaced by her vice president, Michel Temer, until December 2018. Rousseff lost her position after being found guilty of misrepresenting the nation's finances, misleading investors to generate more revenue for the federal government. Popular opinion turned against Rousseff for a different scandal, however: the Petrobras corruption scheme, known as “Operation Car Wash. ” During the tenure of her predecessor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the   oil corporation Petrobras systematically overcharged on contract projects. Rousseff's Workers' Party (PT) colleagues pocketed the difference to the tune of millions. Rousseff was Minister of Energy while the scheme was ongoing. In March, shortly before the vote to hold an impeachment trial against Rousseff, police detained da Silva for his involvement in the Petrobras scheme. Rousseff rapidly appointed him her chief of staff, shielding him from prosecution and triggering waves of   protests nationwide. While Rousseff denied that she appointed him to her cabinet to obstruct the investigation, Judge Sergio Moro, who was in charge of the case at the time, released an audio wiretap of a conversation in which Rousseff promised da Silva she would do just that should prosecutors get too close to finding evidence against him. The PT's ouster may not guarantee stability for Brazil, however, as prosecutors say they have evidence that Temer, too, was involved in pocketing illicit money from the corporation.    "

[In an interview with journalist Jo Becker via Facebook, Assange claimed that the liberal media were doing their nation a disservice by refusing to cover Clinton's less than pristine record.   “The American liberal press, in falling over themselves to defend Clinton, are erecting a demon that is going to put nooses around everyone's necks as soon as she wins the election, which is almost certainly what she's going to do,” said Assange.  Becker questioned Assange's own political leanings, asking whether or not his biases were affecting his objectivity. Assange replied that WikiLeaks' “enormous range” was not highlighted by the media and that WikiLeaks had released over 10 million documents on multiple organisations across many countries, highlighting money laundering schemes and the “  mill” in Russia.  Assange has openly stated his distrust of Clinton in the past and released info relating to both Clinton and DNC corruption. He has also claimed that Silicon Valley tech companies such as Google are purposefully painting Clinton in a positive light and are “directly engaged” in Clinton's presidential campaign. Assange denied that he was purposefully targeting Clinton, saying, “We don't target the West. We are an investigative publisher. ”  “We also represent whistleblowers who want to speak to the public like a lawyer to the greatest court in the world, the court of public opinion. We don't target anyone,” he stated.

Throughout his career, General Mattis has made the protection of the USA, our assets, and our allies around the world, his top priority. General Mattis believes in a strong U. S. military posture and understands of the threats we face, like a newly aggressive Iran. He has the type of worldview the leader our Defense Department needs. “For decades, bipartisan national security and foreign policy experts, representatives of our allied nations, respected foreign policy think tanks, and   organizations have praised General Mattis' work. We are happy to stand with them and fully support this appointment. ” In 2013, the RJC led the fight against the nomination of former Sen. Chuck Hagel ( ) as Secretary of Defense, based on Hagel's track record of   statements and his support for what critics called a posture of appeasement toward Iran.

[The film is set to receive a PG rating, with principal production to began in spring 2017.  Schumer comes across as an interesting pick for the title role of Barbie, a movie geared toward young audiences. The    star has made a name for herself in Hollywood for her   stand up comedy, which was epitomized in her raunchy,   2015 movie Trainwreck.  Since 2014, Schumer's Comedy Central show, Inside Amy Schumer, has pushed the boundaries of sexual satire through   sketch comedy. Nevertheless, as Deadline reports, Barbie boasts a “funny empowerment take that sparked the interest of Schumer and made her want to fit it into her crowded movie schedule. ” “Sony chief Tom Rothman brought the script to Schumer personally, and pitched the take to her,” Deadline reports. Schumer reportedly read the script and agreed to the role. The film is currently without a director, is devoid a supporting cast, and doesn't have a release date, although Sony is eyeing a summer 2018 opening. Schumer has had a busy year. She's racked up three appearance on animated sitcoms The Simpsons, Family Guys, and Bob's Burgers. Schumer spent February and March filming Thank You for Your Service, a   that explores the impact Post Traumatic Stress Disorder has on U. S. military service veterans.

While there is at press time no word on the details of the call, presidential aid Christopher Bong Go posted a photo of Duterte speaking to Trump on his Facebook page.  Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay confirmed that the two would be speaking “within the next few days” in a conversation on Philippine television earlier this week. He did not specify what the two leaders would discuss, only noting, “We are really harping on.. fundamental changes [that are worthy] so we can be able to pursue our independent foreign policy. ” Yasay added that, despite Duterte's statements calling for closer military cooperation with China and Russia, “we are not undertaking military alliance with anyone else. ” On Friday, presidential spokeswoman Ana Marie Banaag confirmed the conversation was set for Friday evening Manila time, though “she does not have yet any information on what the talking points would be,” according to  . The news outlet notes that Trump has been clear in his belief that Duterte had exhibited “a lack of respect for our country” in statements regarding Obama. Duterte has repeatedly referred to the outgoing president as a “son of a whore,” and dismissed U. S. Ambassador to the Philippines Philip Goldberg as an “annoying homosexual son of whore. ” The most glowing praise Duterte has had for any Obama administration official has been for StateSecretary John Kerry, who he has referred to as “okay. ” Following Trump's election, Duterte began to change his attitude. “I don't want to fight because Trump is there,” he said the day after the election. “I would like to congratulate Trump. Mabuhay ka (May you live)!” “We both curse. For any small reason, we curse. We are kind of similar,” Duterte said of Trump. He has since humbly referred to himself as “just a president struggling barely to (swim) just above the water,” adding, “I don't think we can be compared” when asked about Trump. “We don't have any quarrels. I can always be a friend to anybody especially to a president, a chief executive of another country. He has not meddled in the human rights,” Duterte said of Trump on another occasion. Duterte's tenure has largely revolved around his “war on drugs,” in which he has encouraged police to conduct extrajudicial killings and offered bounties to civilians who kill drug suspects. Duterte has hurled profanities at anyone who has referred to these actions as human rights violations, in particular responding to the EU with the statement, “Fuck you. ” Duterte's allies in the Philippine government have been as positive as Duterte himself. “Trump acknowledged that much change is needed both in America and the world. Just as President Duterte campaigned for real change,” Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano, a close Duterte ally, said following the election. “Both leaders recognized the need for but were often criticized for their being frank and saying things that the political and business elite thought shouldn't be said. ” Trump will still be competing for Duterte's good graces with longtime American rivals China and Russia. Duterte has expressed particular affection for Russian President Vladimir Putin, with observers describing Duterte as a “starstruck schoolboy” following his first   meeting with the Russian head of state. Duterte said following that meeting that Putin had offered to sell the Philippine military weapons at a “buy one, get one free” rate. Duterte has referred to both Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping as “close friends,” despite the latter's military campaign to invade and colonize pivotal Philippine territories in the South China Sea."

The company's namesake nonprofit organization, the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, offers the best glimpse into the cereal giant's beliefs and a look at the writings and social media postings of the foundation's Director of Racial Equity reveals expressions of sympathy for the murderous communist dictator Fidel Castro and antipathy towards police. [According to the W. K. Kellogg Foundation's website, its Director of Racial Equity and community engagement is Rev. Alvin Herring. Rev. Herring's LinkedIn resume shows he's spent years as a director with the PICO National Network, one of many prominent institutional left activist groups funded in part by leftwing billionaire George Soros.  Rev. Herring paid tribute to Fidel Castro in a recent tweet: Rest in power #Fiidel,  —   Rev. Alvin Herring (@Alvin4Community) November 26, 2016,  In another tweet, Rev. Herring reposts an article called “Why black Americans love Fidel Castro” that praised Castro for pardoning convicted cop killer Assata Shakur. https:  .   —   Rev. Alvin Herring (@Alvin4Community) November 27, 2016,  In the article written by Hermano Fidel and tweeted by the Kellogg Foundation's Rev. Herring, Castro is praised for harboring   black nationalist extremist JoAnne Chesimard, AKA Assata Shakur: When it came to matching words with deeds on the topic of racial equality, the most stalwart leader of the Western hemisphere, over the course of the 20th century, was Fidel Castro  …       …    It was Fidel who gave amnesty to Joanne Chesimard, known now as Assata Shakur, still wanted in the 1973 killing of a New Jersey state trooper, Werner Foerster, in a highway shootout. Shakur was convicted but was busted out of prison in 1979 by comrades. As a leading figure in the Black Liberation Army, which took bolder actions than even the Black Panther Party did, not only getting into gun fights with cops but holding up banks, Shakur became a legend in her time, a Robin Hood of the black masses. As Breitbart News has reported, Shakur was part of a group known as the Black Liberation Army, whose members killed a number of police officers in a nationwide reign of terror in the early 1970s. Shakur was tried and convicted of the murder of a New Jersey state trooper, but later escaped from prison with the help of a   radical group known as The Family, which included members of the Weather Underground. At that point, Shakur fled to Cuba, where she has been living in exile ever since. The author of the article that Herring retweeted goes on to call Fidel “a kind of Martin Luther King with power. ” Rev. Herring's own writings show his willingness to blame law enforcement and side with rioters. In an article written by Rev. Herring for Sojourners in August of 2016 about the Ferguson protests, he shifts the blame away from the rioters and onto the police: Last night democracy was trampled not as the media would suggest by the angry footfalls of sullen youth determined to disturb the peace and wreak havoc in their own community, but by the heavy march of a police force that seemed determined to create tension and antagonize young people  —   young people who are carrying the trauma of nights of unrest and lifetimes of dehumanizing racism. Law enforcement was outfitted with the machinery of war. The officers wore military fatigues and carried automatic weapons. They were helmeted, with their faces obscured, and in the darkness they looked more like machines than human beings.

Jeff Sessions ( ) may have succeeded a Heflin for Alabama's spot in the U. S. Senate, but he isn't from a town called Heflin. [In a segment that aired last month on CNN multiple times shortly after   Trump announced Sessions would be his pick to fill the attorney general post in his cabinet, network correspondent Gary Tuchman visited Heflin, AL and it was identified as Sessions' “hometown. ”  According to his U. S. Senate website, Sessions was born in Selma, AL and grew up in Hybart, AL. When back in Alabama, he spends a lot of his time in Mobile, AL. None of those places, however, are within 150 miles of Heflin, AL. Heflin is situated near   state line and is the first town people traveling from Atlanta, GA, home of CNN's world headquarters, to Birmingham, AL and points beyond on Interstate 20. Breitbart News reached out to CNN for comment, but has not received a response. In the segment, Tuchman pressed Heflin residents on Sessions' past and how they viewed Trump's other picks at the time, retired Gen. Michael Flynn for National Security Adviser and Rep. Mike Pompeo ( ) to lead the CIA. Transcript as follows: GARY TUCHMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT ( ): In tiny Heflin, Alabama, the cabinet nomination of Alabama's own Jeff Sessions is the talk of the town. JEFF SESSIONS, FORMER UNITED STATES SENATOR: I was surprised but glorified. I'm just overjoyed with it. I think he's going to do us a great job. TUCHMAN: Heflin, the county seat of Cleburne County, is where we came to talk about Sessions and other Trump cabinet nominees. As of now it's been all white men named to be cabinet, is that OK with you? NANCY BINION, ALABAMA VOTER: It is, yes. TUCHMAN: But would you like to see a woman if she's qualified? BINION: I would. Yes, I would. TUCHMAN: But not necessarily if everyone's qualified they are all white men, that's OK with you? BINION: It is. WANDA SMITH, ALABAMA VOTER: I'm not a feminist. So it doesn't matter with me one way or the other as long as they know how to do their job. TUCHMAN: 88 percent of Cleburne County voters cast their ballots for Trump. So they are loyal to him as well as Sessions. But we had questions. Jeff sessions in 1986 wanted to be a federal judge. PATRICK GRIZZARD, ALABAMA VOTER: Yes. TUCHMAN: He was rejected by a Republican committee because of racially charged comments he made. He called the NAACP, the ACLU communist inspired,  . Do you think that should disqualify him? GRIZZARD: No. Because 30 years ago that was something common for somebody to say. TUCHMAN: If he said something hike that more recently, few years ago or last year, would you think that would be enough to disqualify him? GRIZZARD: Yes. BINION: 30 years ago, I went to an   school or maybe longer than 30 years. But when I was in high school I went to an   school (INAUDIBLE) all black school. I was all for that because I didn't know any better. TUCHMAN: So if you did know any better back then? BINION: Well, there's a chance he didn't. TUCHMAN: If he made those comments today or a few years ago  —   BINION: (INAUDIBLE) that would bother me. Yes, it would. TUCHMAN: And what about the nominee for national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn? MICHAEL FLYNN, RETIRED ARMY LIEUTENANT GENERAL: Lock her up. That's right. TUCHMAN: Who was a fiery in controversial advocate for Trump on the campaign trail. He in the past has talked about Islam and he said Islam definitely hides behind being a religion. It's a political ideology did that trouble you? AMANDA JOHNSON, ALABAMA VOTER: I don't think that's true. That might be his opinion, but I don't think it's true. TUCHMAN: So does it bother you, should that disqualify him from being the national security adviser? TUCHMAN: He's acknowledged making those comments. JOHNSON: Well, maybe he knows a heck of a lot more about it than I do. TUCHMAN: And then there's the other nominee of the day Congressman Mike Pompeo for CIA chief. A few talk to know much about him but this woman feels the congressman may not have the proper experience to run the CIA. Does that trouble you? CAROLYN LIMON, ALABAMA VOTER: A little yes, sir. If they don't have the experience, yes. TUCHMAN: I mean, but Trump picked him. LIMON: Yes. Well, I might  —   we can't agree with everything he does. TUCHMAN: But in this small town there seems to be a general agreement that the presidential transition is going just fine. Do you think there are some people in this country, the political establishment, the news media who just don't get? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They never had it. I'm serious.

Teddy Goff, a   employee for Clinton tweeted out a picture of a tweet from Ann Coulter calling Trump's speech “the most magnificent speech ever given. ” “Oh my god,” he wrote. “Trump retweeted this. ” “The entire Breitbart homepage is gold right now,” wrote Jesse Lehrich, Clinton's Foreign Policy Spokesperson tweeting a screenshot of the Breitbart homepage.  “From the big tent party to Sheriff Joe's “tent city” party  …   ” Lehrich added.  After the speech, Clinton's National Latino Vote Director Lorella Praeli sent the following statement to supporters: In his darkest speech yet, Trump doubled down on his   rhetoric and attempted to divide communities by pitting people against each other and demonizing immigrants. Trump committed to sending a new “Deportation Task Force” into American communities, rescinding the President's executive actions to protect DREAMers and their families, building a wall that he continues to claim will be paid for by Mexico, and made clear that “Operation Wetback” was not severe enough. The only immigrants allowed in the future are those that pass Trump's own test of ‘desirability.'"

Don't get tired,” the mother yells in the video as the teenagers exchange punches.  Neighbors say that the mother of one of the teen girls gave her daughter a high five at the end of the fight. “The adults were egging on the fight, the mother especially,” said neighbor Mary Wilhelm to WXIN. Wilhelm, who watched the fight from her porch, say police have been called multiple times before to break up fights in that household. “It's not uncommon for this to happen at that house. We see a lot of fights,” said Wilhelm. A video of another fight showing two women beating each other in Walmart in the same town went viral last year. Wilhelm told WXIN that the fights give Beech Grove a bad name. “We keep getting bad reputations in Beech Grove because parents are helping their kids fight. They need to be the better person and stop that,” Wilhelm said. After some neighbors called the police, the video of the two girls has come to law enforcement's attention.

S. a study has found. [In a poll that researchers called “deeply troubling” nearly a third thought the American government was behind the attacks, while another 7 per cent thought it was a Jewish conspiracy. The majority, 58 per cent, said they did not know who was responsible.  Researchers for the Policy Exchange think tank said it was “a cause for concern” that so many British Muslims were willing to “entertain wild and outlandish conspiracy theories”. ICM, who carried out the survey for the think tank, also found that nearly half said they would not support someone to the police if they knew they were involved with supporters of ISIS and other terror groups in Syria. Around 40 per cent also said they would support the introduction of sharia law in the UK, while another 40 per cent were in favour of   classrooms and 44 per cent said schools should require girls to wear traditional Islamic dress. The research also found that the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) often billed as the main spokesmen for Muslims in the UK, reflected the views of the just 4 per cent of those polled. The MCB responded by issuing a statement accusing Policy Exchange of trying to “delegitimise the organisation”. Muslim Labour MP Khalid Mahmood wrote in a foreword to the report: “It is obviously a cause for concern that so many within our communities should doubt the very existence of [extremism] even as we face a severe and ongoing terrorist threat. “Even more startling is the fact that so many British Muslims seem ready to entertain wild and outlandish conspiracy theories   …     believing that dark forces are at work to “do us down” as Muslims. “It is deeply troubling that this seems to have led a   minority to believe that the world is at the mercy of the machinations of dark,   forces. ” The research did find, however, that more than half of Muslims expressed a desire to fully integrate with   while 93 per cent said they had a strong attachment to the UK. Mr Mahmood said this showed the group were among the most “loyal, patriotic and   citizens. ” A similar poll in April found that half of British Muslims thought that homosexuality should be illegal, while four in five thought wives should always obey their husbands. Trevor Phillips, the former head of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) warned Muslim immigrants were creating a “nation with a nation” however the   Guardian spun the poll as showing Muslims felt a “strong sense of belonging”. It said the poll “suggests that in most cases attitudes held by the British Muslim population do not broadly differ from those held by the population at large. ”"

24777,43529,Austria To Ban Migrants From Purchasing Firearms,Breitbart,Chris Tomlinson,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"The Austrian government is set to amend the laws which govern the use and possession of firearms so that illegal immigrants and asylum seekers will no longer have access to purchasing them. [The new changes to the extant amendment to the Weapons Act, which was approved Thursday by the Internal Committee of the National Council prohibits asylum seekers and migrants living in Austria illegally from access to firearms. The bill, which will take effect in March of next year, also looks to manage the use of arms by security agencies and police, a press release from the government stated.  The amendment will not only prohibit illegal migrants and asylum seekers from procuring weapons but also looks to ban legal migrants and accepted refugees until a residency period of five years has passed. Those who have EU citizenship are not affected by the new law, nor are tourists. Any asylum seekers or illegals who attempt to purchase firearms from registered gun sellers could face charges of a year in prison. The sentence for the unauthorized possession of illegal arms has also doubled to two years in prison for anyone breaking the law. The authorities have also announced they will tackle the sales of illegal firearms on the “dark web” with violators facing sentences of three years. Police in Austria will now be allowed to purchase guns up to 9mm calibre without having to apply for a private license to do so. The   migration Freedom Party (FPÖ) have welcomed the move toward liberalization of the gun laws but has requested police not be limited to only 9mm pistols. FPÖ MP Christoph Hagen argued that police didn't need to take separate tests because their reliability should have been tested when they became police officers. Mr. Hagen also voiced his opinion that the liberalization of firearms was a step in the right direction for Austria and that every legal citizen in the country should own a firearm. Austria is one of the few countries in Europe which allows citizens to purchase firearms for the purposes of  . Gun ownership in the country has risen significantly during the uncertainty of the migrant crisis with shotguns being sold out only months into the start of the crisis last October. Neighbouring Germany is also cracking down on gun ownership as Justice Minister Heiko Maas announced this week that the government would be looking to confiscate guns from a sect of German citizens who regard the   War Two constitution as invalid. Mr. Maas has proposed that any persons wishing to buy guns in Germany should be made to sign an oath of loyalty to the constitution.  "

[“We regularly work with our   partners to ensure our ads do not appear on sites that aren't aligned with our values as a company,” said Kellogg's Kris Charles, who failed to mention exactly how Breitbart failed to “aligned” with Kellogg's values. “We recently reviewed the list of sites where our ads can be placed and decided to discontinue advertising on Breitbart. com. We are working to remove ads from that site. ”   Kellogg's decision was spurred by efforts from   pressure groups, who unleashed a social media campaign to pull companies away from advertising on Breitbart by accusing the news network of racism and antisemitism. “Breitbart News is the largest platform for   content anywhere on the Internet,” said Breitbart News    Alexander Marlow. “We are fearless advocates for traditional American values, perhaps most important among them is freedom of speech, or our motto ‘more voices, not less.' For Kellogg's, an American brand, to blacklist Breitbart News in order to placate   totalitarians is a disgraceful act of cowardice. ” The #DumpKelloggs petition quickly gained steam online, generating more 75, 000 signatures in the first few hours and becoming the #1 trending topic on Twitter. Following Kellogg's announcement on Tuesday, a string of disturbing reports began to surface about the   company's alleged racism toward factory workers and its profiting from the use of child labor. Indeed, business and media experts have taken notice and have criticized Kellogg's decision to publicize pulling ads off Breitbart. Yahoo! Finance senior writer Rick Newman said Wednesday that Kellogg's made a mistake choosing to publicly appease   activists at the expense of insulting Breitbart's millions of “devoted” readers. “Breitbart has a devoted and not small audience, and it's not hard to imagine Breitbart supporters saying, ‘Well, we're going to boycott Kellogg,'” Newman said. “Even if that doesn't hurt their business that much, that's the last thing any company wants, is to get in the middle of political stuff going on in the country right now. You have to think: there must have been a quieter way they could have done this. ” What's more, Kellogg's clash with Breitbart could be dragging down the value of its stock, The NY Post's Claire Atkinson reports. “Kellogg's stock has fallen 3. 6 percent in the last two days, in part because of the Breitbart brouhaha,” Atkinson writes. There are parallels between Kellogg's attack on Breitbart burdening its bottom line and the Target boycott this summer that vaporized billions in value. The retail giant's decision in April to weigh in on the transgender bathroom issue provoked a massive boycott that gained over 1. 2 million signers in less than a week. The resulting drop in revenue amounted to a $10 billion loss of overall Target shareholder value. Whether or not Kellogg's (NYSE: K) is set to suffer the same fate remains to be seen.

[“I probably arrested more than a thousand illegal aliens in my career,” retired ICE     Claude Arnold said during an interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly. “I routinely encounter people in possession of voter registration cards  …     I would ask them, ‘Do you or have you voted?' And often, I would get the answer, yes,” he said, adding that about 100 illegals told him that they had voted.  Illegals can vote because they can get realistic fake documents, he said. “The demand is so great for counterfeit documents because the illegal alien population wants to work —  that's the majority of their motivation for wanting to come to this country,” he said. “So there's a huge demand for those documents that are required to pass the employment eligibility verification procedures,” he added. “In every neighborhood where there's a significant illegal alien population, there are at least several document vendors who supply this service. ” Illegals typically buy fraudulent documents in threes, he continued: A counterfeit resident alien card or work authorization card, plus a counterfeit California driver's license, and a counterfeit Social Security card, which costs about $120 to $300. Arnold's interview comes after   Trump declared he would would have won the popular vote if millions who voted illegally were discounted. Democratic Virginia Gov Terry McAuliffe, a longtime ally of Clinton, ignored his state's supreme court ruling and illegally gave 60, 000 felons voter registration cards. Also, at least eight million adult illegal aliens are residing in the USA in defiance of the law. The media did not investigate these claims, automatically declaring them “false” with much outrage and  . Still, voting experts have told reporters at the Daily Mail that it's likely illegal aliens,   and other ineligible people, did vote in significant numbers on Election Day: [E]xperts warn today that the rapid media condemnation of the   is itself flawed —  and that he was at the very least partially right in his claims. They said it is certain that —  among other things —    were registered to vote and [did] cast ballots. It is also certain that there were other instances of illegal voting, including people who vote under false identities, and people who cast ballots in multiple states, which most attacks on Trump's tweet chose to ignore, they warned  …     The most recent serious attempt to measure the number of   voters found that illegal voting is a widespread problem, although not as prevalent as Trump's comments suggested. The 2013 study was conducted by Jesse Richman, a professor at Old Dominion University. The report was based on surveys by the Cooperative Congressional Election Studies in 2008 and 2010, which asked respondents for citizen status and whether they had voted. Based on the data, Richman estimated that 6. 4 percent of   voted in the 2008 presidential election, which would translate to around 1. 2 million votes. According to Richman, about 80 percent of these   voted for Obama against John McCain. But the professor says his findings still wouldn't account for Clinton's entire 2. 2 million lead against Trump in the popular vote. These problems may have been compounded by the outgoing president himself. Days before the election, Obama gave an evasive response in a YouTube interview suggesting to his critics that any voter fraud committed by illegal aliens would not be prosecuted under his administration. True The Vote, an organization dedicated to stopping voter fraud, strongly backed Trump's claims about illegal voting. “True the Vote absolutely supports   Trump's recent comment about the impact of illegal voting, as reflected in the national popular vote,” the group said in a statement. “We are still collecting data and will be for several months, but our intent is to publish a comprehensive study on the significant impact of illegal voting in all of its many forms and begin a national discussion on how voters, states, and the Trump Administration can best address this growing problem. ”"

Only a few responded, none of them Democrats, though the vast majority of military veteran lawmakers are Republicans. Rep. Ryan Zinke ( ) a retired combat veteran and the first Navy SEAL to be elected to U. S. Congress, served with Gen. Mattis in Fallujah, Iraq in 2004. At the time, the Montana Republican was serving as commander of Joint Special Forces in the country and the “Mad Dog” as leader of the First Marine Division. Rep. Zinke described the potential secretary of defense as “a Marine's Marine whose   ability to inspire and lead men and women on the battlefield is legendary. ” “My experience serving with General Mattis in Iraq was one of the most formidable times in my   service with the U. S. Navy SEALs. I learned a lot from the ‘Warrior Monk' and can think of no other man or woman who is as   to serve as the next Secretary of Defense at this point in time,” continued the former commander at the fabled Navy SEAL Team Six. Given his personal experience on the battlefield, Gen. “Mad Dog” Mattis is a man who would understand “war and the warrior ethos” better than any civilian appointed to the Pentagon chief post, argued Zinke. “He makes a point of being in the thick of things with his troops and he makes a point of connecting personally with his men and women  —   something career bureaucrats in Washington are incapable of doing,” he also said. That being said, Gen. Mattis is no stranger to to dealing with the bureaucrats in Washington, D. C. “While trying to keep our troops alive [in Fallujah] General Mattis also had to deal with the politics of the State Department and armchair quarterbacks at the Pentagon and White House, and all under the watchful eye of the international media. General Mattis did an exemplary job. General Mattis has proven himself a thousand times over,” noted Congressman Zinke. Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen ( ) chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, also welcomed Trump's appointment for secretary of defense. “The last eight years have seen a steady erosion of our military's capabilities and readiness. Looking abroad, our enemies often don't respect us and our allies don't trust us. I welcome the nomination of James Mattis as our next Secretary of Defense,” he told Breitbart News, in a statement via  . “A respected and admired Marine leader, I look forward to working with him to restore U. S. leadership across the globe. ” When asked to comment on Gen. Mattis' appointment, Rep. Steve Russell ( ) a retired lieutenant colonel and Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, acknowledged that it was good step towards to prioritizing military readiness and the defense of the American homeland after years of putting it on the back burner. “It appears that the  's national security team will be far more concerned about the readiness for our country's defense than about political social agendas,” he told Breitbart News. Mattis's candidacy to be secretary of defense has also received positive responses from from Sen. John McCain (R. .) chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “General Mattis has a clear understanding of the many challenges facing the Department of Defense, the U. S. military, and our national security,” said McCain, a Vietnam War veteran. “America will be fortunate to have General Mattis in its service once again. ” Trump's choice for Pentagon chief breaks with about 65 years of history by appointing a retired senior military to the post. About 65 years ago, Congress passed legislation saying it was “the sense” of lawmakers that “no additional appointments of military men to that office shall be approved. ” The last military man to serve as secretary of defense was   Army Gen. George C. Marshall under President Truman from 1950 to 1951. Military Times described Gen. Mattis as “the most revered Marine general in at least a generation. ” He is reportedly admired by both Pentagon civilians and military personnel."
25286,44040,George Washington University Hires ‘Reformed' Al-Qaeda Recruiter,Breitbart,Edwin Mora,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"George Washington University (GW) has hired a former   recruiter who has been convicted of soliciting the jihad murder of “blasphemers,” marking what is believed to be the first time that an allegedly reformed Islamic extremist has been employed by a university in the USA. [Some of the radical Islamic terrorists he lured are still terrorizing people, fighting for the ISIS ( ) notes The NY Times (NYT).  In denouncing the decision by GW to hire Jesse Morton, who was known as Abdullah Muhammad when he was helping   grow as a recruiter, Jihad Watch points out: Morton was convicted of soliciting the jihad murder of “blasphemers. ” Would George Washington University hire anyone of any other belief system if he had been convicted of soliciting the murder of those who offended against his belief system? This hire indicates how compromised the universities are: they are so   and so far Left that jihadis are fashionable. Muslims are never a threat, even when they're plotting violence and murder they're protected, privileged victims. In February 2012, he pleaded guilty to using the Internet to solicit murder and encourage violent extremism. He was facing a maximum penalty of five years behind bars for each of the three charges when he was sentenced on May 18, 2012. However, Morton only served four because he is “reformed,” points out Jihad Watch. CNN reports that Morton “once denounced the USA and made threats against the creators of the TV series ‘South Park' for depicting the Prophet Muhammad in a bear suit. ” The “reformed” jihadist was hired as an expert researcher for the Program on Extremism at George Washington University's Center for Cyber  Homeland Security. He will be researching the very same Islamic extremist ideology he once promoted and disseminated. The NY Times describes Morton as a “voice against jihad,” acknowledging that: In the four years that he ran the Revolution Muslim website out of his   apartment in Flatbush, Brooklyn, Jesse Morton became one of the most prolific recruiters for Al Qaeda, luring numerous Americans to the group's violent ideology. The men and women he inspired through his online posts and tutorials were accused of plots that included flying a   plane strapped with explosives into the Pentagon and trying to kill a Swedish cartoonist who satirized the Prophet Muhammad. One of his collaborators was killed in a drone strike in Yemen, where he had joined Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Several are now fighting for the ISIS. Morton brings a “unique perspective” to the fight against terrorism, said Seamus Hughes, deputy director of GW's Program on Extremism, according to CNN. “We haven't figured out how to reach that individual who's going down the path of radicalization,” Hughes also said. “Jesse has been in that world and got out of that world. ” He pointed out that prior to hiring Morton, he discussed it with the FBI, security community leaders, and lawyers that prosecuted the former   recruiter. They reportedly agreed with the decision. “Morton is completely reformed from the days he served time in federal prison after inciting people to join a terrorist organization,” asserts Hughes. “I trust him,” he said. “We did our due diligence. ” Some analysts believe Morton can be an asset to counterterrorism efforts and research. Meanwhile, others have concluded that “deradicalization” does not work."

25888,44642,Chicago Police Union Tells Officers to Refuse Overtime During Expected Labor Day Violence Spree - Breitbart,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"As the City of Chicago continues its descent into chaos and violence, a memo from Chicago's police union is urging officers to refuse overtime shifts during the expected surge in violence over the upcoming Labor Day weekend. [In its memo, the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police urged members to stand in solidarity with officers across the country who have been slain in the line of duty and to protest the “disrespect” the CPD has recently withstood, the Chicago Tribune reports.  “In order to show unity and to protest the continued disrespect of Chicago Police Officers and the killings of Law Enforcement Officers across our Country, we are requesting FOP Members to refrain from volunteering to work   …     for the entire Labor Day Weekend,” the memo says. Generally considered the last summer weekend, Labor Day is often one of backyard BBQs and picnics, but over the last two decades, it has also been a sad excuse for great bloodletting in Chicago's most   neighborhoods. If police refuse overtime that could mean criminals might have a freer hand to indulge their typical mayhem. But Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told the Tribune that staff levels would be adequate for the coming weekend no matter what the union does and even as he made to praise the union he also offered mild criticism. “I would never get upset with the FOP for encouraging officers to spend more time with their families because they should spend time with their families. But having said that, I'll tell you this, the best way for officers to support one another is to be out there for each other,” Chicago's top cop said. Morale among the CPD has been cratering with one disastrous report after another and rising gang violence bringing the Windy City its most dangerous month in what promises to be its most dangerous year in decades. Thus far this year, the Windy City has suffered 2, 903 total shootings, including 448 shot and killed. This year's death rate has already surpassed last year's numbers which ended with 447 shot and killed. Shockingly, Chicago has seen more homicides this year than both NY City and Los Angeles combined, according to the Washington Post. The city is poised to exceed 600 homicides this year, a number it hasn't seen since 2003. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com."

She didn't even show up in Wisconsin. She lost Wisconsin.   …     And in the end, the reason she lost is she had nothing to say. She was running because it was her turn.

25981,44735,Solitary Tiger Sizzles with 65 in Second Comeback Round - Breitbart,Breitbart,AFP,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Nassau (Bahamas) (AFP)  —   Tiger Woods evoked memories of his glory days by firing a      65 Friday at the Hero World Challenge in his second comeback round after a   back surgery layoff. [Former world number one Woods, a   major champion, thrilled about 200 spectators at the   invitational event he hosts at Albany Golf Club in the Bahamas to finish 36 holes on   138.  “It feels great,” Woods said. “I moved myself up the board. ” Woods teed off first but alone and in last place Friday after England's Justin Rose withdrew. Rose, an Albany resident who captured Olympic gold at Rio in August, pulled out with a bad back after shooting a 74 Thursday. Woods, who has slid to 898th in the rankings, shot a 73 Thursday to end the longest layoff of his career after 466 days, then excited those looking for signs he might regain the form that once dominated the sport. After a run of five birdies in seven holes that began at the   ninth, where he made bogey Thursday, Woods made clutch pars at 16 and 18 after double bogeys on each in round one. Woods, who turns 41 later this month, began Friday in cloudy conditions and promptly birdied the   first hole, hitting a wedge approach four feet from the cup. At the   sixth, Woods hammered a tee shot into the fairway but his approach went left into sand. He chipped to 12 feet and sank the birdie putt. Woods rescued par with a   putt at the eighth after pulling his tee shot, then reached the     ninth, the   hole that Woods bogeyed Thursday to launch a downward spiral. This time, Woods found the fairway twice and dropped his third shot two feet from the hole, tapping in for a   33 to match his Thursday start but doing so in   fashion and in less than 90 minutes. Woods lipped out a   birdie putt at 10 and settled for par, then made a   birdie at the   11th, another hole where he made bogey Thursday. The ball rolled to a stop inches from the cup at the   12th to set up another   birdie for Woods. “I couldn't hit it any better than that one,” Woods said. He curled in a   birdie putt at the 14th and   for birdie at the   15th to reach seven under for the round.  —   Clutch putts sustain spark  —   Woods sent his tee shot right of the fairway at 16 and behind a bush in rocky sand. He blasted out into more sand but gave himself a   par putt and rolled it into the cup, pumping his right fist and smacking the putter blade to celebrate. “That was big, to not go down a shot and not lose any momentum,” Woods said. At 18, Woods was right of the green with his approach but putted three feet past the cup and made the putt to end his best round in the event since 2013 after only two hours and 54 minutes. “Those are big par putts to make,” Woods said. Starting solo was not a first for Woods, who went off first and alone in the final round of last year's Memorial tournament after firing a   85 the day before. Woods shot a   74 in that solo effort. Until Thursday, Woods had not played a competitive round since August 2015, when he shared 10th at the PGA Wyndham Championship in Greensboro, North Carolina. He has not won an event since the 2013 World Golf Championships Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone and has not won a major title since the 2008 US Open. Woods, whose 79 career titles are three shy of Sam Snead's   record, stages the benefit event for his charity foundation on a   Caribbean layout at an remote billionaires enclave. The field features six of the world's   players over an Ernie   course with native sand and brush lurking for wayward shots."

26174,44928,Trump-Modern Day Paul Revere Deserves Nobel Peace Prize - Breitbart,Breitbart,Charles Hurt,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Give that man a Nobel Peace Prize! [Trump  —   the modern day Paul Revere  —   rocked the political world when he jumped into the race last year warning about the invasion across America's southern border that politicians in both parties had been desperately trying to cover up for years. Actually, Revere did not have it nearly so hard as Mr. Trump, who was branded a bigot and a racist and   for simply arguing that America should enforce our duly enacted immigration laws and secure our border.  Mr. Trump stuck with the issue and rode it all the way to the Republican nomination. Granted, Mr. Trump always does things his own way. Such as when he celebrated Cinco de Mayo by posing for picture eating a taco bowl from Trump Tower, giving a   and pronouncing: “I love Hispanics!” Not exactly a campaign strategy taught at the Georgetown University for Politicians. Call it Taco Bowl Diplomacy. But, apparently, it works! Mr. Trump swooped into Mexico City on short notice Wednesday to meet with Mexico's president, Enrique Pena Nieto, who has compared Mr. Trump to Adolf Hitler. Mr. Pena Nieto left the private meeting saying he is “certain” thatMr. Trump's “genuine interest is to build a relationship that might lead us to provide both our societies better conditions. ” So, just like Hitler viewed Germany and Poland. Either that or Mr. Pena Nieto is just the latest victim of the lies and smears by the U. S. media and the dishonest political class. Mr. Pena Nieto acknowledged the “fundamental right that each of the countries has to defend its border. ” Talking like that Mr. Pena Nieto would get kicked out of the Democrats in the U. S. He also repeatedly expressed his respect for the electoral process in America  —   a foreign concept to our own president who, even while traveling abroad, has denounced Mr. Trump's qualifications and temperament to be president. On specific substantive issues, Mr. Pena Nieto conceded every major point that Mr. Trump has built his entire political campaign on. The North American Free Trade Agreement needs to be improved, he said. The border is porous and must to be secured. Criminals, guns, drugs, slaves and money pass back and forth with terrifying ease. Mr. Pena Nieto went out of his way to complain about guns being smuggled across the border into Mexico, a humiliating shot at Mr. Obama and his former Attorney General Eric Holder who were caught in a scheme to ship   guns to drug dealers and kingpins in Mexico. He also seemed to scold Mr. Obama's   policy as a blinking neon “welcome” sign, drawing tens of thousands of people from all over the world into his country on their way into America. “There is still a joint challenge including the increasing number of   who cross through our country in order to reach the USA, therein creating serious human crises,” he said. Mr. Trump was cordial and statesmanlike  —   if blunt. “No one wins in either country when human smugglers and drug traffickers prey on innocent people, when cartels commit acts of violence, when illegal weapons and cash flow from the USA into Mexico or when migrants from Central America make the dangerous trek  —   and it is very, very dangerous  —   into Mexico or the USA without legal authorization,” he said. Of course, the only question reporters asked was about how offended Mexicans have been by Mr. Trump and does Mr. Trump want to say sorry. Oh, and will Mexico really pay for the wall? As the question was being interpreted for Mr. Pena Nieto, Mr. Trump stepped in. “Well, I'll start. Nothing like an easy question. ” Yes, they discussed the wall and their mutual desire to secure the border. No, he said, they did not talk about how Mexico will pay for it because it was a preliminary meeting. Sometimes best to leave thornier issues to later. As for the insults? “A lot of the things I said are very strong, but we have to be strong,” Mr. Trump explained. “We have to say what is happening. There is crime. As you know, there is a lot of crime and a lot of problems but I think together we will solve problems. ” Mr. Trump's opponent, meanwhile, was back in the U. S. giving a lecture on “American exceptionalism. ” It has been 270 days since she held a press conference. Oh, and Clinton was consoling her most trusted consigliere who has just left her dirtbag husband after he sexted a picture of his “private” part alongside his baby son, lying in bed. I'm sorry which one of these candidates isn't fit to be president? • You can follow Charles Hurt on Twitter via Charlie Hurt (@CharlesHurt) | Twitter"
26238,44993,Reuters: Working Class Democrats from Famous Rust Belt Town Rally Behind Trump's Populist Message,Breitbart,Breitbart News,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"In a special report for Reuters titled “Why an emblematic American city has turned to Trump,” Timothy Aeppel writes of the   travails of the once thriving factory town of Muncie, Indiana, where white working class voters are rallying behind Trump's populist message  —   many voting Republican for the first time. [One night a month, retired auto workers shuffle into a former elementary school classroom here to discuss their legal fight against the company that cancelled their health care benefits seven years ago.  But the conversation often turns quickly to presidential politics. “It can get pretty heated,” says Gerald Poor, the group's    president, of their political discussions. “I call it to order if it gets out of hand. ” Their anger is understandable. The group is a remnant of a   United Auto Workers union local, which at its peak in the 1960s represented over 5, 000 workers who made transmissions in Muncie for BorgWarner Inc, the global auto parts maker. An American flag drapes the wall at one end of the room, portraits of former labor bosses line the other, salvaged from a union hall that had its own baseball field. For this group of mostly white,   men, the last two decades have brought much loss. In this election  —   with the victory of the populist Trump as the Republicans nominee and the strong run by the populist Bernie Sanders for the Democrats crown  —   many say they feel they're finally being heard again.   white men were once a force to be reckoned with in American politics. Many here speak wistfully of how John F. Kennedy stopped at BorgWarner to talk to workers when he campaigned in 1960. For these men, this year's election is a rare taste of the clout they once took for granted. In the primary, Trump received the most votes of any candidate in either party in Delaware County, which encompasses Muncie. Just over 52 percent of Republican voters went for Trump. Democrats picked Sanders over Clinton by an even wider margin. “Candidates in the past made a lot of promises to the working class in this country and failed to follow through with it,” says    Bruce Reynolds, who followed his father and grandfather into a career at BorgWarner. Gazing through the rusted chain link fence that encircles the sprawling, abandoned factory, where he notes with precision that he worked for “32 and a half years,” he says he's still skeptical of both side's promises. Neither Trump nor Clinton was his first choice. Reynolds and his wife voted for Sanders in the primary, he says. Among other things, they couldn't support Clinton: She's the wife of former President Bill Clinton, who signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which many here blame for Muncie's economic decline. [  …    ] An analysis by Reuters found Delaware County is an extreme example of the declining fortunes of America's white   men. In 2000, white men with less than a college degree accounted for about   of all white men living in the county. By 2014, their proportion had dropped by about 5 percentage points, according to the U. S. Census Bureau. But while this group's share of the population held relatively steady, the earnings of white men with   jobs had fallen dramatically. In 2000, 47 percent of white men working full time were in the bottom third of earners, with incomes of $50, 000 or less based on 2015 dollars. By 2014, 60 percent of them were in the bottom third. Meanwhile, the percentage of white men in   jobs making between $50, 000 and $100, 000 dropped from 43 percent to 32 percent. And the percentage in the ranks of earners above $100, 000 slipped from 11 percent to 8 percent. In essence, white men in Muncie have slid down from every rung of the economic ladder. They have clustered at the bottom, poorer and more isolated than before, even as the overall U. S. economy has grown and globalized. The same trend is visible in faded industrial pockets from New Jersey and upstate NY to Alabama and Kentucky. According to the data, in about 1, 800 counties across the USA —  nearly 60 percent of those where data is available —  the share of white men in the lowest group of earners has grown over this period. The trend is particularly pronounced in the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at NY University's Stern School of Business, studies how people adopt their political beliefs. “Trump is the first candidate to speak to —  and speak for —    white men in a long time,” Haidt says. That separates him from the last two Republican nominees. Mitt Romney, who lost in 2012, didn't do that, “and John McCain didn't particularly reach out to that constituency” in 2008. [  …    ] Muncie was once the epitome of America's muscular manufacturing economy. After natural gas was discovered here late in the 19th century, the city attracted dozens of   glass manufacturers, most notably Ball Corp, which built sprawling factories that churned out millions of mason jars. The auto industry followed, and Muncie became a hub for transmission making. The term “Muncie transmission” is still used by hot rod enthusiasts when talking about gearboxes produced here by General Motors Corp in the 1960s. One particularly powerful version is the “rock crusher,” used in Corvettes and other muscle cars. BorgWarner, based in Auburn Hills, Michigan, has even deeper roots in Muncie than GM. Warner Gear was founded here in 1901 and merged with other businesses to create what became BorgWarner in the late 1920s. Many former workers here still call it Warner Gear. In the 1920s, a    team of sociologists picked the city to study the values in a typical American community. They called it “Middletown,” to conceal the identity of a place they felt was emblematic of the country as a whole. Muncie residents soon figured out it was all about them. [  …    ] Michael Hicks, a Ball State economist who studies manufacturing, says a mix of exasperation with unions and the political elite created the perfect opening for Trump. “It's always easier to blame a larger force for your problems, whether that's Mexicans or greedy factory owners,” he says. “But these people aren't stupid. They know the jobs aren't coming back. ” The bigger concern for many of them, he says, is what will happen to their children. The Reynolds family is a good example. Bruce Reynolds's oldest son, Bruce Jr, is a Baptist pastor and is supporting Trump, albeit reluctantly. “I don't think any of them can fix it,” Bruce Jr says of the fallout he sees from economic hardship in his congregation, from growing drug addiction to broken families. Reynolds's second son, Robert, followed his father into BorgWarner after high school. That job didn't last. After just four years, he was laid off in 1994 during a wave of downsizing. He and his father say it was a trauma from which he never fully recovered. “I make $8 an hour less now than I made 21 years ago,” says Robert, who enthusiastically backs Trump. After a series of   jobs, including a stint at   and as a manager of a video store, he now works overnight shifts at a warehouse for $18 an hour. He likes the job, he says, although the company recently cut three paid holidays, including the Fourth of July. [  …    ] To be sure, Muncie has retained some of its smaller factories, and other jobs have come in, including a call center that tracks down delinquent student loans and a Caterpillar Inc locomotive factory that moved into an old plant. But none of these are unionized, and the wages and benefits aren't as high as the old places offered. One frustration for locals is that the statistical measures of the economy don't seem to reflect what they see around them. Muncie's jobless rate is 5. 7 percent, less than one percentage point higher than the national rate of 4. 9 percent or Indiana's 4. 6 percent. But the impact of deindustrialization —  including the exodus of over 10, 000 factory jobs since 1970 in a city of only 70, 000 people —  is visible almost everywhere. Most of the departing companies tore down their factories, leaving lots strewn with weeds and rubble. BorgWarner left a handful of structures —  including a 1. 2    sprawl of red brick and steel near the edge of town. The city, especially the   white   neighborhoods on the south side, is now dotted with over 2, 000 abandoned houses. Some can't be occupied because they were contaminated by chemicals left behind by meth labs. [  …    ] But the economy alone doesn't explain Trump's appeal. Another family with deep roots at BorgWarner is the Lephart clan. At one point in the 1950s and 1960s, the patriarch and nine of his sons worked there  …    . David Lephart, whose father is one of the nine brothers, avoided the decline entirely through shrewd   and retraining —  but he's still a Trump supporter. He commutes to a UAW job as a pipefitter at a GM plant in Marion, Indiana. He earns about $100, 000 a year, with overtime, he says, and has put both of his children through college. The    says one thing that influenced his transition from Democrat to Republican was talking to his children, whom he describes as part of the “business world. ” His son is now a stockbroker in Indianapolis. “For the first half of my life, I thought Democrat was the only way to be,” Lephart says. “There's this belief that you can't be Republican and union —  but I don't believe that any more. ” Read the rest here."

He initially fled the scene and was not arrested for over a week. After his arrest, the suspect was sent to Washington County jail on $50, 000 bond and will next appear in court on December 14. Fisticuffs and physical altercations have abounded after the recent election. In one case a Trump supporter in Palm Beach, Florida, told police she had to pepper spray a Hillary supporter after the Democrat allegedly assaulted her on Election Day. Before Election Day, a Hillary supporter allegedly shot an   Trump supporter in Cleveland during an argument over politics in a local bar.

It said NAFTA, which by the way, totally underestimated in what I think mattered to some of them in the rust belt. It was stronger than people realized. Bernie helped raise it in the Democratic side and she never had a good answer. MITCHELL: They didn't see the warning signs. One thing on gender, could they have made fake news, negative campaign against a man on health issues? She's got Alzheimer's. She's going to die of this or that. That was out there. They have records now. They have tracked it back. Could you have done that after the pneumonia? She's weak Hillary. Not the crooked Hillary but the weak Hillary.

27419,46175,Farage: Clinton Has 'Lost The Plot' By Claiming UKIP Funded By Russia,Breitbart,Victoria Friedman,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Nigel Farage hit back at accusations by a Clinton crony that the Russian government “openly fund[s]” “ ” UKIP. Mr. Farage observed that the negative campaigning from the Clinton camp is “almost the mirror image” of Remain's ‘Project Fear' in the lead up to the EU (EU) referendum. [Speaking to Breitbart London's    Raheem Kassam on Breitbart News Daily, outgoing UKIP leader Mr. Farage said that the comments made by longtime Clinton confidante Neera Tanden were “slanderous” and that anyone using the epithet “far right” to describe people who believe in   democracy “have lost the plot”.   Tanden, who served in the White House during both the Bill Clinton and Obama administrations and is president of the   progressive   Center for American Progress, made the comments during an interview for Politico's “Off Message'” podcast. The Clinton confidante came out and said that the “Russians are openly funding the   groups, from [Britain's] UKIP to [French political leader] Marine Le Pen” saying that “there is widespread knowledge among the   parties that that is a rising development”.  Mr. Farage said of Hillary and her “acolytes”: “They have chosen me as a political football in this election campaign” referencing Clinton's recent rant where she singled out and accused the UKIP MEP of being in bed with Russian president Vladimir Putin. “I'm absolutely thrilled that they've done that because it gives me a chance to respond,” he said. “All I can say to her acolyte is that I have never taken a penny piece from Mr. Putin, so frankly what she is saying is slanderous. There is no other way of putting it. ” Adding: “If anyone stoops to the level of using the epithet ‘far right' to describe people who believe in   democracy, well clearly they are the ones that have lost the plot, not me. ” When asked by Mr. Kassam whether he anticipates a fully negative election campaign from the Clinton camp, Mr. Farage said that there would be an “  assault” and proceeded to draw parallels between the Democratic campaign and the Remain campaign during Britain's referendum on membership of the EU: “If you look at what I said on that platform [with Trump] in Jackson last week I talked about ‘Project Fear'. “I talked about the negativity that was used by the Remain in the EU campaign in [Britain] which was to tell us that awful things would happen if our side of the argument won, and that all of the protagonists for Leave were bad people  —   demons, basically. “I predicted that that is exactly what would happen in the States in this presidential election campaign  …    It will be an   assault on Trump and anyone that is seen to stand with him or around him. “And we'll be told that if Trump wins Putin will control America, there'll be risk of war, there'll be poverty. “It'll be exactly the same game. Almost the mirror image of what we saw during the referendum campaign. And you know what? It didn't work. ”"
27801,46560,Illinois Rep: Put Serial Numbers on Bullets to Fight Chicago Gun Violence - Breitbart,Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Illinois state representative Sonya Harper ( ) is pushing to require serial numbers on all bullets sold in the state as a way to fight gun violence in Chicago. [She introduced the measure on Tuesday.  According to Fox 32, Harper said, “We just want to know how the guns and the bullets are getting into the hands of our youth and causing senseless harm and murder on our streets. ” Her measure would require a unique number on all bullet casings and the base of the bullet itself, so police could theoretically run numbers of recovered   to figure out where the ammunition was sold. Officers would then go to the retailer to find out who purchased the ammunition. Of course, this would require a database of ammunition purchasers to be created, as that is the only way a retailer would have information that could help an officer know who bought a box of ammunition via a cash purchase. It would also raise the price of ammunition by requiring manufacturers to make a special line of ammunition for Illinois residents. Most importantly, the measure would almost certainly fail to solve crimes, as there are untold millions of rounds of ammunition already in possession of criminals, gang members, and others would are likely to be pulling the triggers Representative Harper is focused on. These individuals would simply use their older ammunition and circumvent ammo control laws the way they circumvent gun control laws every day. It is worth noting that a similar system was in place in Maryland for five years but was abandoned after $15 million was spent and no crimes solved. Breitbart News reported the Maryland system took ballistic fingerprints of firearms through shell casings —  this was to theoretically identify the actual gun from which the bullet was fired. It proved to be a waste of money. AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio. Follow him on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.

My challenges in recent years have been to read two books every month, learn Mandarin and meet a new person every day,” said Zuckerberg in his post.

[On Thursday, the site posted a statement from HGTV affirming the network's policy of LGBT inclusion the network was responding to a Tuesday article from Aurthur implying that the Christian hosts might discriminate against gay couples.  “We don't discriminate against members of the LGBT community in any of our shows,” the network said in a statement. “HGTV is proud to have a crystal clear, consistent record of including people from all walks of life in its series. ” That wasn't enough for Aurthur, who made a point of noting that Fixer Upper has not yet included a gay couple in each of its first three seasons: “When pressed about   couples being welcome on Fixer Upper in particular, the representative for HGTV highlighted the phrase “in any of our shows. ” The series, which just launched its fourth season, has yet to do so. ” Aurthur appears to insinuate that HGTV is   even after acknowledging in her previous article that two other popular programs on the network, Property Brothers and House Hunters, have featured gay couples in the past. The absence of gay couples on Fixer Upper is apparently enough evidence for BuzzFeed to suggest that the show, the couple and the network are all   bigots. Aurthur's second story on the Gaineses also claims that the first article “sparked a firestorm of criticism from Christians who argued that people who oppose   marriage and LGBT rights are persecuted by the media. ” But most of the criticism of the first article came not just from Christians, but also from BuzzFeed's own readers and from many of Aurthur's peers in the media. As one BuzzFeed reader wrote in response to the first article: “This is a tired, forced witch hunt. You are inciting a wave of negative attention on this couple for something that indirectly links to them. That's not journalism, it's petty bullsh*t. ” BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith's weak response to the original article on his Twitter account was similarly challenged by journalists from the Daily Beast and Business Insider. Aurthur's original story reported that Chip and Joanna Gaines attend a church in their hometown of Waco, Texas whose founder, pastor Jimmy Seibert, believes in traditional marriage. In response to the story, Pastor Seibert told Fox News' Todd Starnes that his Antioch Community Church is “absolutely not”  . “We are not only not   but we are   people in their journey to find out who God is and who He has made them to be,” he said. “For us  —   our heart has always been to love Jesus, preach the word of God and help people in their journey. ”   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum"

29267,48031,Virgil: The Trump Deal -- Five Early Clues as to How He Will Govern,Breitbart,Virgil,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Trump won't be president for another two months, and yet already he is scoring successes for American workers, as the deal to keep a thousand or more jobs at the Carrier Corporation reminds us.  [On November 30, a jubilant Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, tweeted out, “1000 Families will have a better Christmas  future because @realDonaldTrump cared enough to fight for them. ” And then he added this apt jibe: “Where was @BarackObama —  Useless. ”   The following day, December 1, the   visited the Carrier plant in Indianapolis.  In his visit, thronged by grateful workers, Trump took time to highlight the good news: that is, not only the jobs saved, but also the $16 million in new investment that Carrier will make —  which will, of course, ultimately create more jobs.  As Vice   Pence said on Thursday, “Today America won and we have Trump to thank. ” Of course, any success for Trump is a defeat for the MSM.  And so The NY Times struck back, packing such loaded phrases as “frenetic activity,” “impulsive gestures,” “compulsively theatrical,” and “headline grabbing” into one of its myriad of   stories.  For its part, The Washington Post was equally eager to undercut Trump's triumph, suggesting that it was somehow   for Trump to roll up his sleeves and actually fight for American jobs evidently, the Post prefers Obama's “what me worry?” attitude of aloof indifference.  Indeed, in June of this year, Obama, asked about the jobs that have gone overseas during his presidency, pronounced to an audience that “Those jobs of the past are just not going to come back. ”  Oh, but wait, there was one time when Obama personally tried to get something done for the American people: That was his 2009 trip to Copenhagen, Denmark, to pitch Chicago as the site of the 2016 Olympics.  As we all remember, he failed in fact, Chicago was eliminated in the first round. As Hannity said of him, useless. Returning to the present day, the Post insinuated this nitpicking commentary on Trump's   success into the fourth paragraph of its “news” story:  Experts said no modern president has intervened on behalf of an individual company, a move that amounts to the nation's highest office choosing winners and losers in the economy. Conservatives have long decried such incentive packages as distorting free markets, while liberals have characterized them as corporate subsidies. For his part, Trump took time not only to rebut the quibbling, but also double down on his activism. That is, he promised to do it again if need be:  I think it's very presidential . . . We're going to have a lot of phone calls made to companies when they say they're leaving this country because they're not going to leave this country. To be sure, a few media outlets recognized Trump's achievement: The NY Post headlined, “Trump is already helping the working class,” adding:  Sure, it's unusual for a   to interject himself in the economic mechanizations of a specific company —  let alone the economy writ large —  but everything about Trump being the next president is unusual. Yes, that's a fair statement: Trump is unusual.  But he just won a presidential election, carrying 30 states and more than 300 electoral votes —  and in recent decades, that's been decidedly unusual for a Republican.   Indeed, Trump can now be thought of as the opposite of a “lame duck” —  that being a politician, still in office, who has lost his mojo.  Instead, Trump has demonstrable clout even before taking the oath office.   In the meantime, it's a safe bet that the average American is thinking to himself or herself: If it takes “unusual” to save my job and other Americans' jobs, too, then please, let's have more unusual!  So, even though his inauguration is nearly eight weeks away, we are learning more about how Trump will lead and govern as our 45th president.  Specifically, we can identify a quintet of key characteristics:  It's all starting to add up to something big —  something that might soon be known as the Trump Deal.    Let's look at each in turn:  1) Keeping promises, keeping in touch.  Immediately after the election, the   TransPacific Partnership, which Trump had vociferously denounced, was tossed out the window.  This defeat for “America Last” globalism came as a painful shock to Obama and also to his establishment Republican allies, such as Ohio Gov John Kasich, who visited the White House in September, as part of an obvious attempt to undercut Trump's candidacy.  Indeed, Kasich has been doubly pained  in November, Trump carried the Buckeye State by more than eight points over Clinton.   Meanwhile, the   is on his   “Donald J. Trump USA Thank You Tour 2016,” emphasizing, yet again, that he is serious about keeping his campaign promises.   For example, as he said in Indiana, “Trust me, we are going to build that wall. ” At the same time, his   machine continues to churn, leaving the MSM to spin its wheels.  In a revealing November 29 Breitbart piece headlined, “Under the Hood: How Trump Has Cut Around Corporate Media to Reach Millions Directly Online,” reporter Matthew Boyle summed up the efforts of Trump social media director Dan Scavino: During the campaign, Scavino oversaw an operation that generated 21 billion Facebook impressions, 1. 3 billion video views, and nearly 50 million “likes. ” Meanwhile, on Twitter, Trump's posts, beaming out to 16. 2 million followers, enjoyed nearly nine billion impressions.  All in all, 36 million people were within his personal social media reach. Yet the heart of this   cornucopia was Trump himself.  As Scavino put it,  The success to our social media platforms comes directly from   and now   of the USA, Donald J. Trump.  It is all Mr. Trump and his messaging. Whether Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram platforms, Mr. Trump is directly involved with our social media messaging.  He loves communicating with the American people, and he loves seeing what is going out. Which is to say, any curious American, fan or foe, can click on “All Trump, all the time. ”  Of course, Trump's instant accessibility is bothersome to the MSM, which has enjoyed its “gatekeeper” function for so long.  To which millions of Americans might say, “Too bad!”  Indeed, some are even willing to take this   reality to the next level.  As Sean Hannity, a leading Trump ally, has boldly suggested, perhaps Trump doesn't need the MSM at all anymore.  Hannity says of the press:  They lie.  They're corrupt.  They're dishonest. They collude.  They're all in this hyperventilating mode about “fake news” now, but they are fake news.  That's them.  It's now on display for the world to see. Then the Fox man added this bombshell of a recommendation:  I suggested the other day that if any of these organizations were involved in collusion with the Clinton campaign, why do they get a seat in the White House press office?  Why does Trump need a White House press office?  These are, indeed, provocative questions.  The rest of us can observe: If the MSM is relentlessly hostile, and if Trump can reach the American people without the MSM, then the logic of Hannity's argument starts to come into focus.  2)   activist.  Already, since the election, the stock market is up, hiring is up, consumer confidence is up to the highest level in nearly a decade, surveys of Wall Street analysts show widespread optimism, and the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development has raised its growth forecast for the US economy.   Still, it's worth recalling that Trump isn't even president he hasn't had a chance, yet, to implement the promises he made at Gettysburg, PA on October 22, including, “lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion worth of   American energy reserves. ” That is, energy resources currently strangled by government red tape.  Yet even now, investors are factoring Trump's   policies into their bullish projections.  We might note that Trump will not be the only     in his administration.  As Politico reported on November 30, Trump's choice of Steven Mnuchin as the next treasury secretary comes with Mnuchin's declaration that new investments in infrastructure will be a “high priority. ”   In addition, Mnuchin strongly praised Trump's work to keep Carrier in Indiana, labeling it “terrific,” recalling,  The   and the vice   picked up the phone and called the CEO of the United Technologies and told them we want to keep jobs here.  Can't remember the last time a president did that and this is going to be a terrific opportunity. Moreover, Mnuchin suggested that more such deals would be in the making.  To be sure, the Carrier deal is “only” 1000 jobs, in an economy that employs 124. 7 million.  So yes, of course, America not only needs better   it also needs better  .  And the   administration pledges just that: tax reduction and reform, deregulation, and more energy production, just for starters. As Trump said on December 1, his mission is to “reverse the stagnation and usher in a period of prosperity and growth. ”  Then he added: We'll compete in the world, we want to compete in the world, but we're going to compete in the world where it's a   road, not a   road.  The advantages are going to come back to our country, and they haven't for many, many years. And once again, political hope is on its way to becoming an   policy reality.  Here's the   headline in The Washington Post: “Trump nominees map out plans for tax cuts, trade and   negotiations. ”  As Mnuchin also noted: It starts with an attitude of this administration.  This president, this vice   is going to have open communications with business leaders. Needless to say, Trump's   for jobs and profits horrifies   ideologues and Trump haters.  Here, for example, is a tweet in response to the Carrier deal from Rep. Justin Amash ( ) a hardcore libertarian:  Not the  's job.  We live in a constitutional republic, not an autocracy.    meddling shouldn't be normalized. And The Wall Street Journal editorial page —  long a hotbed of Never Trump globalism —  also chimed in with a critique.  Reading their words, an ordinary American might fairly conclude: These libertarian ideologues care more about their intellectual abstractions than    workers.  And we might further note that such intellectual abstractions have a funny way of always serving the interests of Wall Street globalists.  Meanwhile, many on the left also criticized the deal, including Binyamin Applebaum of The NY Times:    It is impossible to assess the merits of the Carrier deal until we know why the company changed its mind —  and at what cost to taxpayers. And Ralph Nader, too,  .   In addition,   Never Trumpers, such as Amanda Carpenter  —  now happily ensconced at CNN —  will never miss a chance to trash Trump, even when he saves US jobs. Yet even so, some   Democrats are climbing on board the Trump Express.  Here are the words of Virginia's Democratic governor Terry McAuliffe, a longtime supporter of Bill and Clinton:  Defense spending, infrastructure —  if we can work together on those things, we're gonna have a good, healthy relationship.  The elections are over.  Politics is done.  Let's get to work. One needn't be fond of McAuliffe nonetheless to recognize this reality: When leaders work together on behalf of   projects, well, it's more likely that jobs indeed will be created.  Indeed, one can see an emerging political model of, yes, Putting America First.  As Trump said on his trip, “Companies are not going to leave the USA anymore without consequences. ”  And that means that the breezy assumption —  so dominant during the Clinton, Bush 43, and Obama administrations —  that outsourcing and offshoring are inevitable, even desirable, is over.  In fact, across the country, it's likely that vulnerable American workers are delighted: Finally, a president who remembers the Forgotten Man, and the Forgotten Woman.  3) Inclusive approach to governing.  Here we can start by recalling Trump's selection of Pence as his running mate Pence, of course, is not only from the heartland, but also straight from the heart of the Republicans.  And there was the choice also of another insider, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, to be White House chief of staff.  Most recently, we can note Trump's selection of Elaine Chao —  a presidential appointee in the last three Republican administrations —  as his secretary of transportation. (Chao, of course, is also the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.)  And then there's the case of Mitt “Never Trump” Romney.  If Trump can forgive him, and even share a cozy meal, then obviously he has the capacity to forgive, and perhaps include, anyone.    Once again, not everyone will appreciate every last one of Trump's personal, or personnel, choices.  But our purpose here is not to praise what Trump does but, rather, to inventory the early clues we are seeing about his governing style.  And mixing in Republicans insiders is definitely a part of that style.  4) New spirit of common sense.  As George Orwell once put it, “The heresy of heresies is common sense. ”  As for Trump, his entire campaign has been about common sense, starting with such obvious goals as closing the border to terrorists, standing up for law and order, and rebuilding America's infrastructure.    Indeed, the   evidence indicates that Trump's approach is winning people over, despite the polarization and hard feelings of the last year.  And that seems to be a testament to the gut appeal of his commonsensical approach.    Of course, with Trump, a lot of it starts with Twitter.  And that's wise, because as we know, the MSM hasn't gotten any friendlier.   And so, operating outside of the MSM's onetime monopoly, Trump has gotten to work.  On November 21, for example, he placed a condolence call to the family of slain San Antonio police officer Benjamin Marconi.  (Not only did Obama not call, but it's a safe bet that nobody in the White House even thought to suggest it.)  More recently, Trump has taken up the issue of burning the American flag: He's against it, and he thinks   should be punished.  Of course, the  's stance on basic patriotism has evoked much   among establishmentarians they declare that even the most odious   behavior is “protected free speech. ”   Yet what these   don't say is that burning Old Glory has only been “protected speech” since a 1989 Supreme Court decision.  And as we all know, the Court can reverse itself at any time —  and perhaps a Trumpified SCOTUS will do just that.   In addition, Trump undoubtedly spoke for the vast majority of Americans when he tweeted out, in the wake of the latest incident of domestic terrorism, at Ohio State University on November 28, that the Somali refugee who committed the attack “should not have been in our country. ”  We can add: There aren't enough NPR reporters in the country to talk the average American out of agreeing with Trump on that one.  As Trump said in Cincinnati  on December 1, our current immigration and asylum policies have been “stupidly created by our very stupid politicians. ”  And he further pledged, “We will suspend immigration from regions where it cannot be safely processed. ”  We can add that this   is especially urgent since the Obama administration is in the process of admitting thousands of potentially dangerous refugees that have been rejected by Australia.  That's right: Under current policy, we are now taking an allied country's rejects.  Now let's look at another f'rinstance that illuminates how Trump thinks, on the one hand, and how the MSM thinks, on the other.  Here's a  headline from the   magazine, The New Republic, on November 30: “What Will Happen to Chelsea Manning Under Trump? Trump has threatened to review the military's transgender policies, putting the whistleblower's future at risk. ”   We all recall the case of Chelsea Manning, aka Bradley Manning, the Army soldier who leaked hundreds of thousands of classified documents in 2010.  Manning was prosecuted under the Espionage Act and sentenced to 35 years in prison.   And once in prison, Manning declared that he was a she.   And so, bolstered by a slew of ACLU lawyers, Manning demanded a   operation, as well as associated hormone treatments.  That's right, a criminal demanded such a remarkable medical dispensation, with, of course, the insistence that Uncle Sam pay it.  Not surprisingly, the Obama administration quickly agreed.   Thus we can step back and see: The left has slipped into the dialogue the silly notion that   surgery —  which costs $  thousand, not including hormone treatments, etc. —  is just another worthy  form of “healthcare. ”   And so, of course, as with Obamacare, the government should pay for it.  Now we can pause for a moment to recall that Trump himself has zero   animus.  Indeed, in his Cleveland acceptance speech, Trump carefully articulated the words, “LGBTQ” as he recalled the terrorist attack in Orlando, FL.  And he also invited Peter Thiel, the gay Silicon Valley mogul, to speak for him to the conventioneers.  Yet still, Trump has kept his perspective, distinguishing between basic human rights and foolish liberal boondoggles.  And so during the fall campaign, Trump challenged the “politically correct” Obama policy of “social engineering,” adding that  instances such as the Manning case were “ridiculous. ” Yet as The New Republic sobbed: It took Army officials nearly 18 months after she sought treatment for gender dysphoria to approve her for hormone treatments, but she is still required to conform to male military dress standards. And the magazine further worries that under a Trump administration, “She would probably be the first person to lose care” —  care being defined, of course, as including costly   surgery.  Meanwhile, the rest of us can say: Manning is a criminal, and maybe this is what a true punishment looks like.  5) Uphold   American nationalism.  It wasn't so long ago, 2008, to be exact, that Obama traveled to Berlin to address his worldwide audience as “citizens of the world. ”  To which the proper response, of course, is that to be a “citizen of the world” is to be a citizen of nowhere.  Trump, of course, has always seen things differently from Obama: As he also said in Cleveland, “Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. ”  In the meantime, we are starting to see, more and more, that   philosophy translated into personnel.  It's been obvious for a long time that Trump admires generals indeed, on December 1, he picked another one, Marine Gen. James Mattis, to be his secretary of defense. So what might the rest of us conclude from Trump's choices so far?  This much is obvious: Trump respects the military uniform, and those who made the conscious choice, decades ago, to don that uniform on behalf of the nation, thereby assuming the greatest possible personal risk.  Indeed, we can go further, and make a larger point about American nationalism: It's hard to think of any category of American that more epitomizes the patriotic, nationalist spirit than the man or woman who volunteers to shoulder the burden of our national defense.  Of course, not everyone agrees: According to the MSM and most professors, nationalist sentiments are to be deemed only as “racist,” or “xenophobic. ”   Yet here's a dissenting view from a   gay liberal, Jonathan Haidt of NY University, writing in The American Interest.  Haidt maintains that nationalism is, ultimately, an expression of affection, even love, for one's own fellow citizens —  nothing more, and nothing less: Nationalists see patriotism as a virtue they think their country and its culture are unique and worth preserving.  This is a real moral commitment, not a pose to cover up racist bigotry.  Some nationalists do believe that their country is better than all others, and some nationalisms are plainly illiberal and overtly racist.  But as many defenders of patriotism have pointed out, you love your spouse because she or he is yours, not because you think your spouse is superior to all others. Thanks to the hard work and heroism of Gen. Mattis, Gen. Mike Flynn, and all the other military officers in Trump's orbit —  along with, of course, the efforts of all other   personnel and veterans —  those who don't agree with Haidt are free to express their contrary opinion.   Yet in the meantime, those who agree with Trump, Mattis, Flynn, et al. are equally free to express their opinion. (Except, of course, on PC college campuses.)  As Trump said on December 1: We are going to bring our country together, all of our country. We're going to find common ground, and we will get the job done properly. God bless Trump for seeking to bring the country together.  And yet here we can say, with all due respect, that perhaps the   was being a bit, shall we say, aspirational.  That is, do we really think that George Soros, Al Sharpton, and their legions of paid and unpaid protestors are ever going to clasp hands with Trump?  Yet as we have seen, Trump is ready, if need be, to do battle —  and he has the tools he needs, including a   army, a   action agenda, a basic common sense, and an instinctive   patriotism.  And so the battle of is to continue, and it probably will, Trump is  .  In other words, this tweeting and      will be governing in his inclusive, commonsensical,   style. Yes, the Trump Deal is emerging —  and the MSM and the Democrats will just have to deal with it.  "
29337,48101,FULL TEXT: MILO Explains The Patriarchy At Ohio University - Breitbart,Breitbart,Milo,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Welcome to the Dangerous Faggot Tour! My name is MILO, the supervillain of the Internet. Thank you for spending your Friday night with me. I know you could be out partying with all the students from Miami of Ohio who I hear come to Athens every weekend.[  You've made a good decision. I'm here to teach you more about the world than all of your professors put together. But first, I have to teach some another college a lesson. Or rather, their administrators. Yesterday, I spoke at West Virginia University where I drew attention to two colleges that were trying to dick my lovely student organizers around by requesting massive security fees a few days before my events were scheduled to take place, effectively torpedoing them.  Now, one of those colleges, Minnesota State, has backed down and lowered the security fee. Because of course they did  …    All it took was a little polite, gentle encouragement from myself and Breitbart News.  But the other college, Iowa State, is holding out. Big, big mistake Iowa State, let me tell you.  Now, not only is Iowa State potentially breaking the law by failing to cover security costs themselves, but they're also bringing the full force of MILO down upon them. But you know, I'm a nice, kind, forgiving guy, so I'm giving the colleges a few days to come to their senses and waive the fees. It's not hard  —   Iowa isn't the first college to try this tactic, only to realize their horrible mistake and come to their senses. [SLIDE: UC Irvine, University Of Alabama, Minnesota State University logos] You see, these are the smart ones. They realised they were doing more than fucking over isolated student conservatives. They were also getting into a game of chicken with me and Breitbart News. And that's not a place you want to be, because we never blink.  So, Irvine, Alabama, and Minnesota have saved their reputations. Particularly Minnesota, which I'm told has a very free   president who made a real effort to ensure the event wasn't torpedoed by security fees. Tellingly, the other two colleges had to suffer a little bit more of the Milo treatment before they rolled over.  Iowa State, however, have decided that they want to suffer the full force of the Milo treatment! So, if you'd like to let this university know what you think of their attempts to stifle free speech and intellectual diversity on campus, here is the email address of the president.  This president has announced to the world that he would like his college to have a reputation like the University of Missouri, which has lost tens of millions in donations because they caved into the regressive left.  Instead of taking the route of the University of Chicago, which is attracting accolade after accolade in the press for standing up for free speech and against safe spaces and trigger warnings, he wants to consign his college's reputation to oblivion. Well, fine! If that's what he wants, I'll happily help him do it!  Now, what about your university?  It was important for me to come to Ohio U because you need a big dose of free speech here. Perhaps not quite as much as the two I just mentioned, but a fairly big dose nonetheless. Let me take you on a trip down memory lane, Now I must give a trigger warning for any liberals in the room, this will be upsetting. Can you believe the Greek community had the audacity to put this up on your graffiti wall? My god! They wrote Trump 2016! And Build the Wall!  How dare they. Now, your college president, Roderick J. McDavis did what every liberal does  …     he called for diversity and inclusion.  They never call for diversity of thought, or inclusion of conservatives, do they? But I'm sure he rushed out a response to Black Lives Matter messages  …    . Right? President McDavis said that while the wall is “a place for free speech and expression,”   expression has a “very different meaning” to some people. It is a classic case of “If your speech doesn't agree with liberal groupthink, shut up”.   This wasn't a   event either. Thankfully, young conservatives are learning not to shut up when they are told to. They are fighting back, and winning. In September the College Republicans struck back with another Trump wall message.  Of course it was quickly covered over, but free speech isn't that easy to shut down anymore. My personal response to President McDavis, and the liberal professors and administrations of every university in America is simple: Trump won, bitches!  And young conservatives are ready to fight AND WIN the culture war for free speech on campus. I will share with you a perspective you don't often hear as students: that of your alumni. Most alumni have this attitude of “Not my college. ” They think the left's war on free speech and common sense exists everywhere EXCEPT their school. It gives me a sick thrill to watch their faces crumble when they learn their alma mater is just as horrible as the rest. One of my closest colleagues at Breitbart is an Alumni of OU, he was here almost 20 years ago. The shock he felt when he learned that liberal students called the police because their feelings were hurt was amazing to behold. Imagine the poor liberal students sobbing to the police over the message “Trigger Warning: There are no safe spaces in real life. You can't wall off the First Amendment. ”  It is always amazing how the liberals hate the police until something offends them, isn't it?  The reaction of Alumni when they learn that not only are the students of their Alma Mater a bunch of crybabies, but the university itself coddles those babies, is to stop donating. Just ask the University of Missouri how they are doing after losing donor after donor.  In March last year, Missouri admitted that they had lost about 1, 500 students and were experiencing a budget shortfall of $32 million, just a few months after the protests. We've also learned that the university had to close four dormitories  —   including two called Excellence and Respect. At the time, the interim Chancellor wrote  “I am writing to you today to confirm that we project a very significant budget shortfall due to an unexpected sharp decline in   enrollments and student retention this coming fall. I wish I had better news. ”  Unexpected? I didn't find it unexpected at all! Hopefully Ohio University sees the light on diversity of political opinions before it too feels the financial pinch, but no promises  …     these university types are not very bright. I'm glad we've already mentioned safe spaces this evening, because I think they will be in use tonight. With the election of Trump, we must press forward with free speech on campus. Daddy can fix a lot things, like he just fixed Carrier in Indiana, but you students must fight your own culture war. Tonight we're going to do what feminists are not willing or able to do. We're going to define the Patriarchy.  You see, feminists don't really like to define the Patriarchy. They prefer to keep it nebulous and amorphous, so they can conveniently blame it for everything that goes wrong in their lives. Not being paid enough? Patriarchy! Not getting a promotion? Patriarchy!  Too many catcalls? Patriarchy! Too few catcalls? Patriarchy! The air conditioning is too high? Patriarchy! Eggplant emojis? Patriarchy! To many of us, myself included, the patriarchy is a source of good jokes. My birthday is now internationally celebrated as “World Patriarchy Day. ”  Let's be honest, the garbage that flows out of feminists' mouths doesn't need much help to be funny. A 400 pound   behemoth with more piercings than chins  —   BUT ONLY JUST BARELY  —   screeching about how she needs to live on donations because  …    . The Patriarchy!   I mean the jokes write themselves. It is a truth universally acknowledged that no two feminists have the same definition for what the patriarchy actually is.  Well, two feminists have never agreed on ANYTHING  …    . EVER, except maybe that cats make ideal life partners. There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, feminists like most academic charlatans like to use lots of big long words like “intersectional” and “systemic” to make themselves seem clever without doing any real science. They think this hides the fact that they aren't actually saying anything. It works with grant applications, but it isn't working on the general public.  Sorry ladies! According to a Huffington Post poll from 2013, just 23 per cent of women were willing to call themselves feminists, compared to 82 percent of women who said they believed in equality of the sexes. In the UK the crisis for feminism is even worse. The Fawcett society, a feminist charity, found that just 9 percent of women identified with the label, compared to 74 percent who said they believed in equality of the sexes.  What does this tell us? That people no longer associate feminism with equality of the sexes. Quite right too! Of course, the reason why a few women still turn to feminism isn't hard to understand. Just look at your own university's gender studies professors! [SLIDE: Faculty Photos] Can anyone guess why these women might have grown into bitter, resentful middle aged  ? The other reasons why feminists can't agree on a definition of the patriarchy is obvious. Feminism is like any   group  —   a perpetual catfight. Feminists are always in competition with each other to be the queen of all feminists, and thereby getting the most money from donations. This leads to each radical feminist creating a broader and more ridiculous definition of the patriarchy than the last. Thirdly, let's be honest, gender studies is the softest of the soft sciences. By soft I'm not referring to the typical feminist belly, or the genitals of male feminists, but rather to the quality of their scholarship. They just don't put much work into it, because if anyone questioned the quality of their work, they must be  …    . say it with me  …    .. THE PATRIARCHY. There is some precedent for this in culture.  Feminists are like the Borg from Star Trek.  They don't know anything about other groups beyond the fact that they need to be assimilated into a hivemind that mindlessly follows the orders of a Queen.  Sounds like college. But in this case, resistance is not futile they are losing. We see a similar attitude among journalists about guns.  They don't know anything about guns except they are evil, kill people by themselves, and are either  's or Glocks. The Democrats  …      …    and Kelloggs  …      …    and Pepsi do the same thing by calling all Trump supporters deplorables and white supremacists.  They've lumped in millions of people with the   most of which haven't even heard of the  .  I'm sure some of you taught your parents about Pepe over Thanksgiving right? It's all about blaming someone else for everything that goes wrong.  Smarter people than me call this the “external locus of control. ” Every political group that's slightly mental has one. The external locus of control is the thing you blame for all the world's problems, and often your personal problems as well. So for Alex Jones fans, it's the New World Order. For feminists, it's the patriarchy.  Generally speaking, feminists define the patriarchy as everything that is not feminist dogma. It is a conspiracy at all levels of western civilization designed at every turn to control women's lives and hold them down as second class citizens. Strangely, they never accuse the Middle East of all those things, even though that is where it's all actually happening.  In practical terms, the patriarchy is a crutch feminists use to explain their personal failings.  It isn't their fault they couldn't get a date, it is the patriarchy's fault.  It isn't their fault they couldn't get a job with a gender studies degree, it is the patriarchy's fault.  Considering the weight of many feminists, it's good they have a metaphorical crutch because the real kind won't support their weight much longer. Feminists even blame the patriarchy for making math icky, and for not liking obese people.  In all fairness, on the last point we can say “guilty as charged”. So in summary, the patriarchy is anything and everything. We don't yet see radical feminists accusing eachother of being agents of the patriarchy, but it is only a matter of time. Like communists accusing each other of betraying the revolution, 2017 is likely to bring charges of internalized patriarchy to campuses around the nation.  I can't wait to see that. I imagine the facial expressions the poor girls will make might look like this. [SLIDE: Chanty “big red” Binx making an upset face] Make no mistake, if   feminism precisely defined the patriarchy, it would destroy their movement. The majority of Americans and Europeans would recognize it is actually with everything that makes the west great, and the radfems would be laughed out of anywhere EXCEPT campuses. On campuses, where liberal softies still rule with an iron fist, feminism is as safe as a city with no women drivers.  That is the ONLY thing I support about Saudi Arabia by the way. I once thought that if feminists took over the world, there would be immediate global nuclear war. It would be touched off by the smallest of things, like not Retweeting a selfie fast enough, or speaking to a man without accusing him of rape.  Now I recognize that feminists are far too   for nukes, they'd rather destroy western civilization by importing murderous barbarians and teaching boys that masculinity is evil and cuckoldry is noble. Now that we've looked at the patriarchy from the feminist point of view, let's switch gears and look at the patriarchy from a   rational place. The patriarchy, to put it simply, is Western Civilization. The patriarchy is America. They are inseparable. The patriarchy is the idea that people can achieve their best if they work hard, it doesn't matter if you are rich or poor, what color you are, or are a man or woman. And yes because it is rooted in science and reality, the patriarchy believes there are only two genders. The patriarchy says your potential is not based on your identity, but what talents you are born with and to what lengths you will go to achieve greatness. The patriarchy has resulted in everything important in America, including this college campus.  In 50 years, after most of today's feminists have died from complications related to obesity, their writing and thinking will be relegated to the backwaters of study, if they are remembered at all.  But the USA Constitution, the Magna Carta, and if I may humbly say my book which will come out in 2017 will still be studied and taught in school. Well, maybe not my book, unless a lot changes on campus.  The patriarchy does not value men over women, or particularly favor them. These claims by feminists are fictitious. Men are the casualties of war, the vast majority of suicides, and practically everyone killed on the job.  Yes, that's right, there's actually a death gap, and it massively favors women. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that men make up 92 percent  —   92 percent!  —   of workplace deaths. That's real gender inequality.  Beyond dying, men also do the dirty jobs, get the short end of the stick in family court, and are expected to support their family at all costs to themselves. According to the same data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women make up less than 1 percent of the following professions: boilermakers, brick masonry, septic tank servicing, sewer pipe cleaners, and trash collectors. Amazing that we haven't heard about it! We hear endlessly about the need for more women in cool,   jobs like technology and nuclear physics and video game design, but nothing about the lack of female sewage workers.  In every meaningful way, the patriarchy favors women. Women are critical to the patriarchy, and much harder to replace than men quite frankly. Women hold families together and raise the next generation of shitlords. In a pinch, I could turn straight for a while to make sure the species doesn't go extinct. One thing the patriarchy certainly does is recognize that men and women are not the same. That shouldn't be a mindblowing concept for anyone in the room, but it is for feminists. They want to insist that women act like men.  In fact all of the dozens and dozens of genders they believe in have the single purpose of confusing the feminine and the masculine. Those that aren't about getting strange men into women's bathrooms of course. Feminists complain that some areas of study are overwhelmingly male. The patriarchy doesn't mind that the vast majority of nurses and teaching students are women, because many women are interested in those careers and have a talent for them.   Why is feminism about taking options and agency away from women? Women should be able to study whatever they want. Women should study STEM if they have a talent for it, and can keep up with the other students. Like the presidency, having a vagina should not be a consideration for what major a college student chooses.   Any woman who did not support Clinton for President was branded an internalized Misogynist.  Even crazy lefties like Susan Sarandon.  Why does being a woman define exactly what women must do and how they must vote? Sounds pretty sexist to me.  Speaking of Hillary, she mentioned some of my articles in one of her low energy campaign speeches.  One of my recent favorite headlines is “How To Make Women Happy: Uninvent The Washing Machine And The Pill“. The point of that article is that inventions like the washing machine and the pill were designed to force women that might have chosen to be homemakers into the workforce. They removed the women's agency in a very   manner. Why has western civilization declared war on the housewife? It isn't a new phenomena, but it is one of my own deepest questions. Most likely they want to do to the family what they did to Europe  —   turning it into an unrecognizable shithole full of bodily waste and garbage. The patriarchy recognizes that anyone, male or female, will be miserable if forced into a particular role they are not suited for. That is borne out by the evidence  —   women have become intensely unhappy over the last 35 years. Of course women should not be forced to stay home and keep house. Many women are interested in careers. More power to them!  But they shouldn't be vilified for staying home, and they shouldn't be pressured to study a particular major just to make the sisterhood proud. I often use America's trips to the moon as one of the pinnacles of patriarchy. Nothing embodies the dedication to greatness through science, applied technology, courage, and audacity as the race to the moon. The patriarchy loves a good bad guy, and the Soviets made excellent bad guys throughout the space race. Naturally, feminists argue that the reason women are   in space exploration is because there's a big bad patriarchy constantly telling them that they can't be astronauts and should be housewives instead.  Yeah, sure, pop culture has never given us any female astronauts as role models. That's why we had to watch Sandra Bullock in space screaming like a total cunt for two hours.  Perhaps the patriarchy will one day soon get us to Mars too. If man does travel to Mars, there is a reason the patriarchy will be behind it. When the spacecraft is three months into the journey to Mars, if the Oxygen system breaks down, the astronauts will not care if the engineer of that system was a woman, they will care that they can't breathe. In outer space, identity politics aren't worth anything  —   only getting the job done.  Imagine if the survivor in the Martian was a male feminist. He'd probably write a long blog post about how he was making Mars a better place by ridding Mars of its last white male. He'd wish his wife and his wife's boyfriend a good future on Earth and promptly kill himself. In a recent interview I brought up the moon landing, and shortly after I received an email from a fan.  They said “It wasn't only the patriarchy, it was also Margaret Hamilton!” Margaret Hamilton. A brilliant woman.  One of the great early computer programmers in fact. She played a key role in the Apollo program, including the programming that helped the astronauts reach the moon safely. My fan was mistaken  —   he thought that Margaret Hamilton, just by virtue of being a woman, was not part of the patriarchy. Now this is a concept that will make leftists faint dead away  …     lots of women are part of the patriarchy!  The majority of women believe in equality between the sexes, but don't identify as feminists.  These are patriarchal women, and I'm guessing a lot of women in the audience fall into this category. Margaret Hamilton absolutely is part of the patriarchy. She was the best in her field and contributed the highest caliber of work to the Apollo mission. Her gender and identity were never part of the equation. Only her skill.   Do you think Margaret Hamilton ever put tape over her nipples and joined a slut walk? Do you think she ever made art with her period blood? Of course not. I think she's the type that would punch you in the mouth if you called her a female programmer instead of a programmer.  This reliance on merit over personal identity is the patriarchy. There is your single sentence definition, but if I just said that at the beginning, I wouldn't get to listen to myself talk for an hour. Girls, if you want to be like Margaret Hamilton, pick a subject and never give up. Think about learning a marketable skill instead of complaining about gender injustice, or writing additions to the Vagina Monologues. Feminism believes the best path forward for women is to study things they don't want to study, to take jobs they aren't qualified for or suited for, and to say, think, and vote exactly how this amorphous sisterhood tells them to do. It shouldn't surprise anyone that feminism simply doesn't work. I used to think that if feminists ruled the world, we'd all be living in mud huts. But now I question their ability to make a mud hut, what is a step down from that? I don't know, maybe a women's studies classroom when their periods are all in sync. Compare that with the patriarchy, as personified by Trump. Trump has appointed women to some of the highest jobs in the federal government, and has a history of promoting female managers, and the first female construction supervisor for a skyscraper in 1980. Of course the patriarchy isn't only about hiring and promoting women that are competent at their job.  It involved a lot of men, because patriarchy embraces masculinity. Look at Trump's new Secretary of Defense, General “Mad Dog” Mattis.  This guy is so   he makes Clint Eastwood look like a Thai ladyboy. He might as well double up as Secretary of the Patriarchy! Mad Dog Mattis understands that national defense, like gender, is a binary.  Friend or foe. Success or failure, or, as the Marines would say, victor or vanquished. Without the patriarchy, there is a simple term for America's future  …    . Conquered. To close out this evening's presentation, in case there are any liberals not yet completely triggered, I'd like to share a quote from General Mattis. Perhaps the most patriarchal quote of my lifetime: “You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn't wear a veil. You know, guys like that ain't got no manhood left anyway. So it's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them. Actually it's quite fun to fight them, you know. It's a hell of a hoot. It's fun to shoot some people. I'll be right up there with you. I like brawling. ” Written from prepared remarks. "
29444,48208,WINNING: Ford Motors Open to Deal with Trump to Save U.S. Jobs - Breitbart,Breitbart,Lee Stranahan,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Bloomberg News is reporting that Mark Fields, the CEO of Ford Motor Co. is open to brokering a deal with   Trump to keep jobs in the USA. [Ford's CEO indicated he's looking for a turnaround in the sort of overbearing government regulation that Trump campaigned against, including fuel standards put in place by the Obama administration and the EPA in 2012. As Bloomberg reported:  “We will be very clear in the things we'd like to see,” Mark Fields said in an exclusive interview at Bloomberg offices in Southfield, Michigan. “We'll continue to advocate for   rules to promote free and fair trade. One of our priorities is making sure   standards reflect market realities, tax reform in general we would be very supportive of, and the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles. ” Just two days ago, the Washington Post reported that the Obama EPA was holding firm on the fuel standard regulations it put in place that Ford's CEO says don't “reflect market realities. ” WaPo wrote: The Obama administration says it plans to stick with strict fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks for the model years 2022 to 2025, despite protests from some automakers and concern about how the incoming Trump administration might alter them. EPA administrator Gina McCarthy on Wednesday proposed leaving the current standards in place, saying an extensive technical analysis had shown that automakers are well positioned to meet the greenhouse gas emissions targets that were established in 2012 with the goal of reducing pollution and nearly doubling fuel economy. The mention of autonomous vehicles by Fields shows the company's commitment to emerging auto technology. Ford said in August that it is shifting some of its business strategy to focus on driverless cars to operate as taxis, competing with startups such as Google's Alphabet and Uber. Ford plans to have vehicles with no steering wheel, gas, or brake pedals on the road by 2021. The announcement by a major U. S. auto maker that it would work with Trump to save American jobs comes on the heels of the announcement by air conditioning maker Carrier that it would keep 1, 000 jobs in the U. S. that the company was planning to movfe to Mexico. Although the Carrier deal was hailed by Trump supporters as well as workers, who sent messages of thanks to   Trump, it was criticized by some in the media and by a Mexican official who called the deal “worthy of a banana republic. ” Ford CEO Fields told Bloomberg that he felt there were important differences between Ford and Carrier, saying that the regulatory changes he was proposing “would impact the entire industry, as opposed to giving special deals to individual companies. ” Ford currently has about 8, 800 workers in Mexico but employees 85, 000 in the USA.

29542,48306,"Exclusive — Trump: Race Is Turning Around, Hillary's ‘Polls Starting To Go Down' While ‘Mine Are Going Up' - Breitbart",Breitbart,Matthew Boyle and Julia Hahn,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"PHOENIX, Arizona  —   Fresh off of his historic meeting with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto and his immigration policy speech here on Wednesday, Republicans presidential nominee Trump slammed Democratic nominee Clinton for running a negative,   campaign in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News. [Just a few short weeks after the senior most level of Trump's campaign underwent a major shakeup, the trajectory of the race has shifted with Trump's poll numbers rising —   and Clinton's slipping.   “I think we've had a great few weeks, and yesterday was certainly great,” Trump said when asked if his immigration speech and trip to Mexico represented an inflection point in the campaign. “Yesterday was certainly great with the president of Mexico and the speech in front of 15, 000 people. You know there was 15, 000 yesterday, you saw that?” Trump looked presidential and extracted two key concessions from the Mexican president: namely, that there's a need to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and that the USA has a right to build a wall. “I have great respect for the President of Mexico,” Trump told Breitbart News. “I thought he was a fantastic person and a fantastic representative for Mexico. And I have great respect [for him]. He's a very fine person and I enjoyed being with him. ” Trump said that with the polls shifting and the momentum now on his side, Clinton is sliding. She has not held a press conference in over 270 days, and barely ever even holds public events anymore. Trump, who has held many press conferences as a candidate, highlighted this contrast in his interview with Breitbart News. “I think it's terrible that she doesn't do press conferences,” Trump said when asked about how Clinton hasn't held any in nearly a year. “She's being coddled by the press. They're trying to get her through it. I think it's a shame that she doesn't do press conferences. I think it's a shame. It's a shame for the American people. All she does is she'll put out a professionally   line about me, her agency will write up a line about me and she'll put that out. The whole thing is ridiculous. It's starting to backfire now. Enough about Trump. Everything she says is a negative ad about Trump. I think people don't want that. They'd like to see positive stuff. ” In particular, Trump noted that the media has refused to press Clinton to explain her “radical” immigration plan, which, according to Pew polling data, is opposed by at least 83% of the American electorate. During his immigration address in Phoenix, Trump challenged the media to begin asking Clinton about her immigration platform.  “The media needs to begin demanding to hear Clinton's answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security,” Trump said in his immigration address here Wednesday night. “These are matters of    for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Clinton  …     What we do know, despite the total lack of media curiosity, is that Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. The result will be millions of more illegal immigrants, thousands of more violent crimes, and total chaos and lawlessness. ” Trump said earlier in his interview with Breitbart News that the reason why Clinton cannot do press conferences is because she is running a   campaign devoid of anything but negative attacks on him. “Her speech yesterday was terrible,” Trump told Breitbart News. “All she does is hit Trump and it's not going to work because it's just not going to work. That's all she does is attack Trump. She has no policy. She has no energy. She has nothing. She didn't go to Louisiana —   where she should have gone —   and they're very angry at her, and they should be angry at her. But she didn't go to Louisiana and she didn't go to Mexico. ” He also noted that Clinton didn't go to California to see the drought problems there, which Trump did, and noted that “it's so easy to fix. ” “That is one of the easiest problems in the world to fix,” Trump said. “It's crazy. But she does not have the energy or the stamina to Make America Great Again. ” Trump explained that Clinton's   campaign is part of the reason why Democrats are turning to Trump. “I heard about the Trumpocrats,” Trump said, referring to   lifelong Democrats who plan on voting Republican in November in order to help elect Trump president. “I love that. I love those people  …     It's a big deal,” Trump said, noting that the reason they are turning to him is because “Clinton is the wrong messenger. ” “She can't get the word out,” Trump said. “All she does is attack me. I just left the veterans at the  American Legion and they tell me that she starts attacking me out of nowhere. And they don't want to hear about that. They want to hear about health care and things. But she starts attacking me, that's what she wants to talk about. That's all she's doing. And now her polls are starting to go down big league and mine are going up. ”"

30048,48813,Brains Of Holocaust Victims Discovered In Munich Institute,Breitbart,Deborah Danan,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"TEL AVIV  —   Dozens of brains and other body parts were discovered at the Max Planck Psychiatric Institute in Munich, Germany, when the building was undergoing renovations. [The remains of the bodies are reported to have belonged to victims of the Holocaust who were subjected to Nazi experiments, including children, the mentally ill, and the physically disabled, the Max Planck Institute said according to a report by Israel's Army Radio.  The samples were likely used by Nazi brain researcher Julius Hallervorden, who conducted experiments on humans during and after the Nazi era, and even served as the Institute's head of neuropathology in 1938. The Institute, then called the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, often received human body parts from the Nazis, including from the notorious Auschwitz physician Josef Mengele. The findings prompted an investigative committee to be formed in order to review the samples. The committee has begun identifying some of the victims with the eventual goal of burying them in a mass grave, a process that could take years. The Institute published a statement on its website after the discovery. “We are embarrassed by these findings, and the blemish of their discovery in the archives. We will update the public with any further information that comes to light with complete transparency,” the statement said. The Yad Vashem World Center for Holocaust Research was not previously aware of the existence of the remains at the Institute, the report said. “It's surprising, although not completely. We know that experiments were conducted and that not everything was erased and buried. Two years ago, bones of victims on whom experiments were conducted were found in Berlin in the trash. Next year, we're going to organize a convention about this issue,” Professor Dan Machman, Director of the International Center for Holocaust Research at the museum, told Army Radio. “This [discovery] is something new that was previously unknown, and joins other events that are suddenly uncovered after 70 years,” he said. “Whoever thought this chapter was completely finished is mistaken. It's hard to know if these samples are exclusively from ‘mercy killings' [i. e. the murder of sick people for the purposes of experimentation] or if they also derive from other sources,” he added."
30058,48823,Report: Last-Minute Secret Exceptions Nullified Important Provisions of Iran Nuclear Deal - Breitbart,Breitbart,John Hayward,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"According to a report by the Institute for Science and International Security, a   think tank with a retroactively unfortunate acronym, Obama's nuclear deal with Iran includes even more secret side deals than we thought  —   most, or all, of them favoring Iran. [“The exemptions or loopholes are happening in secret, and it appears that they favor Iran,” said the Institute's president, David Albright, a former weapons inspector for the United Nations.  Reuters listed some of the report's findings, adding that it could not independently verify them, including two exemptions that nullified restrictions on how much   uranium Iran can keep in its nuclear facilities a provision that would allow Iran to continue operating 19 “hot cell” radiation containment chambers and permission for Iran to store 50 tons of heavy water in Oman under its control, instead of selling it, as required by the nuclear deal. The Institute noted that the   uranium could be processed into   material, so the secret side deal makes it effectively impossible to know how much bomb material Iran could produce, on fairly short notice. The hot cells can also be “misused for secret, mostly   plutonium separation efforts,” according to the report. These secret modifications to the deal, which is formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) were made by a joint commission staffed by all parties to the deal, including the U. S. and Iran.  One source explained that without the   modifications described in the Institute's report, some of Iran's nuclear facilities would not have been in compliance with the   terms of the JCPOA when sanctions against Iran were lifted in January. That would have been rather embarrassing for the Obama Administration. The White House claims these changes to the JCPOA were not kept secret from Congress, but at least one prominent critic of the nuclear deal, Senator Bob Menendez ( ) who is a senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee, told Reuters he was “not aware” of the exemptions, and was never briefed on them.  Albright, who was a   on the report, said the exemptions have been kept secret from the public, and were not disclosed to Congress until after they were granted to Iran. “Since the JCPOA is public, any rationale for keeping these exemptions secret appears unjustified. Moreover, the Joint Commission's secretive decision making process risks advantaging Iran by allowing it to try to systematically weaken the JCPOA. It appears to be succeeding in several key areas,” wrote Albright and his   Andrea Stricker, who has written extensively on the illegal nuclear trade and Iran's nuclear program."

The film is already the   documentary of this year with $12. 5 million in receipts, beating out the IMAX documentary A Beautiful Planet and Michael Moore's Where to Invade Next, which earned $3. 8 million during its theatrical run in February. “It couldn't be more timely,” D'Souza told Breitbart of the timing of the   which comes as Clinton and Republican candidate Trump spar over accusations of racism. “I think there's momentum on Trump's side, and part of it is that Trump has begun to go where no previous Republican has gone.

There is no shattered glass ceiling without broken shards of glass. [Thus, her enemies from Moscow to Benghazi, from London to Manhattan rifle through all her purloined emails, the ones they were not ever supposed to see because she had hidden them, deleted them, destroyed them, even “BleachBitted” them. Indeed, hell hath no fury like a woman on a mission to destroy her yoga emails.  They paint a greasy scene in which the Department of State is transformed into a global shakedown scheme with the ClintonFoundation as the gatekeeper and “favor” maker around the world. It is an international crime syndicate run ruthlessly by the Clinton mafia. Working ceaselessly around the clock in every time zone, the syndicate doles out favors and meetings in exchange for millions of dollars to the ClintonFoundation from anyone, any entity or any government willing to pay. The Clintons' personal ATM is one hungry and indiscriminate beast. Who knew downward dog could be so lucrative? Donning her martyr's veil, Mrs. Clinton never stops firing back. She is under siege from American   groups.   Russians are afraid of her. Criminal hackers want to stop her. The hopelessly   Associated Press is telling only half of the story correlating the connection between donations to the ClintonFoundation and “favors”   meetings with the secretary of state.

30693,49458,Blue State Blues: The Graph That Explains Trump's Surge - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"When a resurgent Trump invited the families of victims killed by illegal aliens to join him onstage at his immigration speech in Arizona on Wednesday, he outsmarted the networks, like CNN, that had often ignored or cut away from them. [But he was also repaying a debt. Without those families, Trump would have crashed out of the Republican primary race, just as almost everyone expected he would. By listening to them, and amplifying their voices, he connected to a broad constituency and won the nomination.  With their help, he may win the presidency. The proof can be found in an interactive chart at RealClearPolitics, which tracked poll averages during the primary. On July 10, 2015, former Florida governor Jeb Bush was the frontrunner, at 16. 3%. Trump was a distant seventh, with just 6. 5% of the vote. Keep in mind that Trump had been running against illegal immigration since he launched his campaign more than three weeks before, with his infamous remarks about illegal aliens from Mexico. None of that had resonated much. And then, on July 1,    Kate Steinle was shot and killed in San Francisco while strolling along a pier with her father. The murderer, Juan Francisco   had been deported five times before, and had been convicted of seven felonies. He later told a local journalist that he had specifically come to San Francisco because it was a “sanctuary city” that would not cooperate with federal immigration officials or enforce immigration laws. Breitbart News focused on that story in the days that followed. Breitbart California's Michelle Moons, who had covered the protests in Murietta against   illegal alien children who had surged across the Mexican border exactly a year before, wrote a series of articles about Steinle. She used her extensive sources in the law enforcement community, as well as among families who had lost loved ones to crimes by illegal aliens, to build the details of the story and place it in a broader context. That was when Trump began to show an interest in meeting with those families, who had reached out to him in the days after the Steinle murder. He met with them on July 10 in Los Angeles, and the enduring image of that event was of the   Trump standing silently as he listened to the families pouring out their grief.  Few other politicians had ever bothered. These families were inconvenient to a national debate in which the Republicans had already conceded to the opposition. One of the parents who participated, Sabine Durden, later spoke exclusively to Moons: [Trump] listened to each one of our stories and was visibly shaken and touched. We got hugged and he promised to continue to fight for us and our kids. We then went to a separate room where the press was staged. He addressed them and then gave each of us time to share our story. The press tried to pin him down on his previous comments. He stood his ground. I had a Coke bottle that read HERO on it and I told him that he should have it. He is my hero because he was the only one who got attention to this truly important issue. From that moment, Trump took off in the polls, and almost never looked back. From seventh place in the RealClearPolitics average on July 10, Trump shot to first by July 19. His dramatic rise is all the more surprising given that only 7 percent of Americans called immigration the “most important problem” facing the country in a Gallup poll taken over the same period. By listening to the families, and giving them a voice, Trump was no longer speaking of illegal immigration in the abstract, but in a concrete, human way. In so doing, he connected with others who had been victimized, or ignored, by their own government on so many issues, from trade to Obamacare. On Wednesday night, he   that connection. He is surging again. The question now is whether Trump can convince enough voters by November 8 to trust him, as the victims' families do. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

Williams, Ph.D.",2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"In his message for the “World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation” Thursday, Pope Francis said that   global warming, as well as a loss of biodiversity are “sins” against God, which must be atoned for by planting trees, avoiding the use of plastic and paper and “separating refuse. ”[“Global warming continues, due in part to human activity,” Francis said, adding that “2015 was the warmest year on record, and 2016 will likely be warmer still. ”  “This is leading to ever more severe droughts, floods, fires and extreme weather events. Climate change is also contributing to the   refugee crisis. The world's poor, though least responsible for climate change, are most vulnerable and already suffering its impact,” he wrote. Repeatedly citing the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, who has “courageously and prophetically continued to point out our sins against creation,” Francis made his own a new list of such environmental sins, which include pollution, global warming and deforestation. For human beings to “destroy the biological diversity of God's creation,” to “degrade the integrity of the earth by causing changes in its climate,” to “contaminate the earth's waters, its land, its air, and its life —  these are sins,” he wrote. Summing up, the Pope stated that “to commit a crime against the natural world is a sin against ourselves and a sin against God. ” Lamenting “the devastation of the environment,” Francis said that “God gave us a bountiful garden, but we have turned it into a polluted wasteland of debris, desolation and filth. ” Specifically regarding a loss of biodiversity, the Pope suggested that now there are fewer species to give glory to God. “We must not be indifferent or resigned to the loss of biodiversity and the destruction of ecosystems, often caused by our irresponsible and selfish behavior,” Francis said. “Because of us, thousands of species will no longer give glory to God by their very existence, nor convey their message to us. We have no such right. ” The Pope said that the World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation was instituted in order to give believers an opportunity to “reaffirm their personal vocation to be stewards of creation. ” It also furnishes an occasion to thank God for the gift of creation, to implore his help for its protection and to beg “his pardon for the sins committed against the world in which we live. ” During this Jubilee Year, “let us learn to implore God's mercy for those sins against creation that we have not hitherto acknowledged and confessed,” Francis said, while proposing that Christians need to undergo an “ecological conversion. ” Now is the time to “acknowledge our sins against creation,” the Pope said. “Inasmuch as we all generate small ecological damage,” we are called to acknowledge “our contribution, smaller or greater, to the disfigurement and destruction of creation. ” “Let us repent of the harm we are doing to our common home,” he added. If our ecological conversion is real, Francis said, it will lead to concrete ways of thinking and acting that are more respectful of creation. Among these are “avoiding the use of plastic and paper, reducing water consumption, separating refuse, cooking only what can reasonably be consumed, showing care for other living beings, using public transport or   planting trees, turning off unnecessary lights, or any number of other practices. ” In his message, the Pope also applauded “a growing global political consensus” regarding the environment, praising the adoption of “Sustainable Development Goals” as well as last December's Paris Agreement on climate change, “which set the demanding yet fundamental goal of halting the rise of the global temperature. ” Apparently the pontiff's prayers have already been heard, since scientists are now forecasting that 2017 will be a cooler year than 2016.

According to NJ. com, the legislation, S86, allows schools and colleges to hire retired police officers as “special law enforcement officers. ” Christie “conditionally vetoed” S86 two months ago because the first version did not require the retired officers to undergo “specialized training covering security issues that routinely arise in the school setting. ” He explained the veto, saying, “It is vital to ensure that the officer is integrated into the unique setting of a school community and is properly trained to function not only as a safety expert and law enforcer, but also as a liaison to community resources, educators and counselors. ” The necessary changes were made to S86 and the Boston Herald reports that Christie signed it, saying: The safety of our children is of paramount concern, especially in the wake of senseless violent attacks in the very places that students and teachers should feel safest. This legislation creates an affordable option for all New Jersey communities to provide security in their schools with properly trained officers who have decades of experience. It allows existing police officers to keep our streets and neighborhoods safe. Campus carry and other forms of legislation to arm teachers in public schools have gained momentum throughout the country since 20 students and six unarmed staff members were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012. Christie's signature on S86 is a reflection of this momentum and of the understanding that defenseless students and unarmed teachers are sitting ducks.

In a Facebook video widely circulated on the internet Lahren recognizes Kaepernick's right to protest, yet takes strong exception with the manner in which he has elected to protest. [Noah obviously disagrees with Lahren's stance and took her to task. Though the entire debate runs nearly 30 minutes, the relevant portion on Kaepernick can be seen here:      Noah's opening argument constitutes either a really bad joke, or a monument to colossal ignorance: “You say Colin Kaepernick is exercising his First Amendment rights and you are exercising your First Amendment rights in criticizing him. So, what you are saying is, ‘You have the right to say anything you want. So shut up. '”  His understanding of free speech sounds essentially the same as Fidel Castro's understanding of free speech, which states “free speech for me, but not for thee. ” If that speech doesn't agree with the approval of people like Trevor Noah, then free speech is immediately suspended, and any view to the contrary must be stopped. Noah cut Lahren off before she had a chance to respond to his question of how a black man in America can peaceably get his message across in “the right way” without being called a thug or instigating a riot. Of course, one peaceful way in which a person of any color could get their message across without getting accused of thuggery, or starting a riot, is voting. Colin Kaepernick not only neglected to vote, he has never even registered to vote. Not to mention the fact that voting amounts to a far more effective tool of change, than  …    well  …    whatever it is Kaepernick thinks he's accomplishing by kneeling on the sidelines.

38512,57360,Woman to airline: That's not my son!,CNN,Shachar Peled,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"NY (CNN) Maribel Martinez got the surprise of her life at the airport last month when airline employees brought her a boy  who had just arrived on a flight from the Dominican Republic. They thought he was her son. He wasn't. The    mother waited last month at John F. Kennedy International Airport for Andy, 5, to arrive from a visit to his family in the Dominican Republic. But the child never got off the designated JetBlue flight. ”She was petrified” and feared an abduction, said her lawyer, Sanford Rubenstein. According to Rubenstein, Andy's aunt had put him in custody of JetBlue at the Santiago airport and waited until the flight took off. Despite being paid an extra $100 for Andy to be accompanied by a JetBlue representative, the airline confused him with a different boy and Andy was put on a plane to Boston, the family says. ”On August 17, two unaccompanied children of the same age traveling separately from Santiago, Dominican Republic    one to NY JFK and one to Boston    each boarded a flight to the incorrect destination,” Tamara Young, a spokeswoman for JetBlue, said in a statement. ”Upon learning of the error, our teams in JFK and Boston immediately took steps to assist the children in reaching their correct destinations. While the children were always under the care and supervision of JetBlue crew members, we realize this situation was distressing for their families.” An hour and a half after landing at JFK, the other boy was presented to Martinez, holding Andy's passport and luggage. ”I was crying, looking at the passport of my son, looking at the suitcase with my son's clothing, and I was desperate. I was sitting next to a boy that wasn't mine,” Martinez told CNN affiliate Univision on August 22. After three   hours of waiting, Martinez was finally able to speak over the phone with her son, who was located in Boston. It took another three hours for Andy to be reunited with his mother. CNN was unable to learn more about the other boy, but JetBlue said he was safely returned to his family. Rubenstein said he planned to write a letter to the Federal Aviation Administration asking it to investigate the incident. JetBlue said it was reviewing what had happened in order to ”prevent similar situations from occurring in the future.”  ”We don't want them to investigate themselves, and that's the end of it,” Rubenstein said. JetBlue has refunded Martinez for the flight and offered a credit of $2, 100 for future flights. But Martinez is not interested. ”I don't want it. I don't want it. The damage is too far done,” she said."
38514,57362,Dilma Rousseff is out. Now what? ,CNN,,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,," (CNN) Brazil's problems cannot be solved merely by a change at the top. Even with Dilma Rousseff out as President, the road ahead for Brazil won't be easy. She leaves behind an economy in its second straight year of recession, an unemployment rate of nearly 11% and a   looming statewide corruption scandal that leaves almost no politician unscathed. Here's a deeper look at the major obstacles ahead for the world's ninth largest economy: New president inherits problems Rousseff faced. .. By conservative estimates, new President Michel Temer inherits about $72. 5 billion, or 250 billion Brazilian real, debt, Sen. Waldemir Moka said. As Brazil continues to wade through the longest recession since the 1930s, its once burgeoning middle class is feeling the pinch. More than 11. 6 million people in Brazil are unemployed, or about 11% between April and June. There are signs the market is picking back up since Temer took office in May, but it has a lot of ground to cover.  In the last year, Brazil's economy fell 3. 8% though there are signs the market is picking back up since Temer took office. Brazil's currency has rebounded slightly against the dollar.   Temer and his team of economists have won over Wall Street, but we'll have to see how he juggles spending cuts on pensions and welfare, signature leftist policies from his predecessors. ”This is a moment of hope, to rebuild trust in Brazil. Uncertainty has come to an end. It's time to unify the country,” Temer said after Rousseff's impeachment.  Read more: Brazil impeaches president as recession deepens, New President hasn't had the greatest track record. ..  Temer, who was once Rousseff's deputy but is not from her party, was sworn in to finish out her term, through the next general election in 2018. While many Brazilians were in favor of Rousseff's impeachment, they aren't exactly fans of Temer, whose party is also ensnared in corruption charges. According to polls in April, many Brazilians favor a new election altogether and want Temer impeached, too.  In his debut as interim President, he cut his Cabinet down to cut costs but was criticized for ending up with a new leadership team made up entirely of white men. The last time this happened was in 1979, when Brazil was ruled by a military dictatorship. One politician who voted for Rousseff's impeachment called him a ”vampire” and ”virus.” With the world watching, Temer was booed at the Opening Ceremony at the Rio Olympics. Although he has the support of foreign investors, his slim popularity will be challenged as he pushes for austerity and privatization measures to fix the economy.  Read more: 5 things to know about Michel Temer, Fallout from corruption scandal is just unfolding..  More than 100 people have been arrested in the last two years, accused of involvement in an estimated $3 billion scheme in which politicians are accused of taking kickbacks from   oil company Petrobras. Rousseff, who once chaired Petrobras, was not personally investigated and has repeatedly denied involvement. She has accused her critics of having done far worse.  Charges against Rousseff's mentor, former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, appear to be ramping up. Although he hasn't been officially charged, federal police recommended charging him of accepting kickbacks for lucrative construction contracts.  Members from Temer's Brazilian Democratic Movement party have also been charged in the investigation. In an interview with CNN, he denied wrongdoing but acknowledged that as President, he could face impeachment. ”I am aware that if I do become the President, I, too, could be processed for any political wrongdoing,” he said.  Read more: What's Petrobras and 'Operation Car Wash'?  What's next for Rousseff? Although lawmakers convicted Rousseff of corruption, they failed to pass a motion banning her from political office. Rousseff can never be President again, but she could give it a run in the lower offices. She left office fighting for her political life until the end, repeatedly calling the trial a coup, and effectively bringing an end to 13 years of the Worker's Party in power.  ”When Brazil or when a President is impeached for a crime that they have not committed,” she said, ”the name we have for this in democracy    it's not an impeachment, it is a coup.”"
38516,57364,Gabon erupts in post-election violence,CNN,,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,," (CNN) Dramatic scenes unfolded this week on the streets of Gabon's capital city of Libreville, as protesters clashed with police following word of the presidential election results.  Violence erupted Wednesday after Interior Minister Pacome Moubelet Boubeya announced the results from Saturday's vote, which showed that incumbent President Ali Bongo defeated opposition candidate Jean Ping by a very slim margin: Bongo had 49. 8% of the vote, while Ping, a diplomat and former African Union official, had 48. 23. Turnout was 59% according to the country's election commission. Nearly 600, 000 people were registered to vote. The final results must be confirmed by the country's constitutional court within a week. The opposition claimed the results were fraudulent and thousands of people took to the streets of the capital in protest. The Parliament and other government buildings were set ablaze overnight Wednesday into Thursday, as government forces tried to restore order. Shops and businesses were looted. Three people died in the violence, Gabon's Interior Ministry announced in a statement Thursday. Hundreds reportedly were injured. Patrick Obiang, the Red Cross director of operations in Gabon, told CNN on Thursday that while his teams are still assessing the number of casualties, they have seen at least one body of a protester who was killed in the overnight clashes. Bongo's   would extend his family's   rule over the   nation by another seven years. Bongo took power from his father, Omar Bongo, in 2009, when similar protests erupted. The US and France have expressed concern about the situation in Libreville and called for restraint by both sides. The US State Department called on the government to release the results from each polling station, saying ”elections must credibly reflect the will of the people.” The government has faced criticism for its response to restore stability and for reportedly interrupting communications. ”I am deeply concerned and saddened about the situation in the Gabonese Republic provoked by the electoral crisis, in particular the arson attacks and disproportionate response of security agencies that has led to unfortunate loss of life and property,” UN Secretary General Ban   said in a statement."
38517,57365,Mexican president explains why he met with Trump,CNN,Theodore Schleifer,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Washington (CNN) The president of Mexico explained Thursday why he invited Trump to visit his country, pitching the trip as a chance to meet with someone important    even if the Republican nominee is widely disliked in the country. ”I was very clear in public and in private to emphasize the fact that in Mexico, we feel offended and hurt by his statements about Mexicans,” Enrique Peña Nieto wrote in an   for his El Universal. ”I expressed that we deserve respect, that we are honest, hardworking people, that we value our families and the culture of effort.” Peña Nieto and Trump met in Mexico City Wednesday on a whirlwind visit ahead of Trump's major immigration speech in Arizona. In public, Trump and Peña Nieto mostly struck a friendly tone, though acrimony later broke out over whether the pair had discussed Mexican payment for a   border wall, a trademark Trump policy. ”I was also very clear in my conversation with Trump on the border: Mexico will not pay for any wall,” Peña Nieto wrote. Trump has disputed Peña Nieto's account, and in his speech on Wednesday he declared, ”Mexico will pay for the wall. 100%. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for the wall.” Earlier on Thursday, Trump shared a video on Instagram of his arrival at the palace by helicopter. ”Thank you to President Enrique Pena Nieto   for the invitation to meet with him in Mexico City, Mexico. Wonderful leadership and high quality people! I look forward to our next meeting. #TrumpTrain #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpPence16” Trump wrote in the post. A Mexican government official and a source close to the Mexican government both tell CNN that the idea for the invitations for Trump and Clinton to meet with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto came from the Finance Ministry. According to the source close to the government, Mexico wants to show it can work with Trump if he wins. Finance Ministry officials hope that having Trump in Mexico will calm down investors who have been fleeing. The Mexican Central Bank registered more than $11 billion in capital outflows in the first half of 2016. The visit was seen as an attempt to prevent the peso from falling. Up to now, when Clinton leads in the polls, the peso strengthens the opposite happens when the polls tighten. According to the Mexican government official, the Foreign Ministry was not aware of the invitations to Trump and Clinton. In fact, Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz and the undersecretary for North America, Paulo Carreño, were in Milwaukee on Tuesday opening the new Mexican Consulate, and she flew back Tuesday night when Trump posted his tweets. Peña Nieto has reiterated that Mexico will work with whoever gets elected."
38518,57366,"Peña Nieto, you got 'punked' ",CNN,,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,," (CNN) In a delirious attempt to divert attention from the fact that he is perhaps the most unpopular President in the history of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto invited Republican presidential nominee Trump to visit him at Los Pinos.  Sure, changing the subject must have seemed like a good idea. After all, the Reforma newspaper has just released a poll showing the President with a dismal 23% approval rating, just a few weeks before presenting the state of the union address to Congress. Meanwhile, his administration continues to be rocked by corruption allegations, a troubled economy and even accusations that he plagiarized his college thesis.  But what has just occurred was a fiasco. Naturally, Peña Nieto also sent an invitation to Democratic nominee Clinton. But that's probably because he never really thought anyone would actually come.  It's a cultural thing in Mexico    you run into a business contact or an acquaintance you haven't seen since that party where you totally made a fool of yourself, and you say you'll meet for coffee. But there's a certain etiquette to these things south of the border. Deep down, you both know you're not really supposed to actually make a plan to meet. It's   Mexican diplomacy, the kind of understanding that runs far and wide across this country of 120 million. Clearly, though, Peña Nieto doesn't get the Trump campaign, and nor do any of his trusted advisers. This despite the fact that Trump has made it his campaign modus operandi to blow up protocols, media outlets and political correctness alike. He is the   candidate. It's what got him the Republicans nomination. As a result, in less than 24 hours, Peña Nieto had backed himself into a corner Trump was on his way. Mexicans were out on the street protesting, social media was abuzz, #TrumpNoEresBienvenido (#TrumpYouAreNotWelcome) was trending on Twitter, and Mexico's President was now hosting a state visit with perhaps the   hated man in the entire country. It couldn't get any worse, but somehow did. Peña Nieto held a joint press conference standing    with a man he previously likened to Adolf Hitler. The Mexican President's speech was gracious, and he said he would work with whomever won November's election. The thing is, Trump isn't the leader of the free world, so you can't expect to play a suave game of hardball with the former host of ”The Apprentice” the way Obama has with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  As a result, Trump got the photo op he wanted, standing there looking presidential in an attempt to bolster his credentials as a potential world leader to anyone still on the fence. And then he opened his mouth and confirmed what Mexicans feared would happen all along: He talked about the wall. To a captive audience in Mexico and the USA, Trump said, ”We did discuss the wall. We didn't discuss payment of the wall. That'll be for a later date.” Peña, te hiciste güey. Peña Nieto just stood there. And even though millions of Mexicans were seething with anger and indignation, their President didn't respond to a comment by a man who has   riled up millions of American voters against Mexico since, oh, about three minutes into his campaign.  True, many Mexicans see Peña Nieto as incompetent and even corrupt. But what Trump said was worse than any of that. So at the very least, Mexicans expected Peña Nieto to reprimand his guest. But it didn't happen. And, as expected, Trump returned triumphantly to Arizona to present a much awaited immigration plan on Wednesday night    and also got to brag about how he had spoken to the Mexican President himself. We all watched, flabbergasted. And were reminded why Peña Nieto is these days as despised in Mexico as Trump. So the neta, or awful truth as we say in Mexico, is not that Enrique Peña Nieto got ”punked” by a Republican nominee (although he did). And it's not even just that Trump could become the commander in chief come January 2017. No, the really sad truth is that this could be what a bilateral conference between these two neighbors looks like in future. Perhaps the most depressing part of all this is that it demonstrates that Americans are far too enthralled by reality TV, in much the same way that Mexicans love their telenovelas. This is despite the fact that these two important nations jointly face genuine challenges such as over the economy, drug and human trafficking and security issues on both sides of the   border. At some point, we're all going to have to remember we need serious heads of state to lead us as we try to address these challenges. But right now, we are still waiting for them."

38520,57368,Hurricane Hermine nears landfall in Florida Panhandle,CNN,,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Apalachicola, Florida (CNN) After boarding up windows and filling sandbags, residents took shelter Thursday night as Hurricane Hermine bore down on the Sunshine State's Panhandle region. Some counties issued mandatory evacuation notices for Gulf Coast communities on the water or in   areas and at least one told people to stay inside after 9 p. m. The governor warned people Hermine would be   and forecasters said the surge of ocean water could be as high as 9 feet above normal levels. Hermine, with its maximum sustained winds reaching 80 mph, was lashing Apalachicola, Tallahassee, St. Petersburg and other cities a few hours before its expected landfall. ”The center of Hermine should make landfall along the coast of Apalachee Bay during the next few hours, then move across the eastern Florida Panhandle into southeastern Georgia early Friday,” the National Hurricane Center said late Thursday night. ”The center should then move near or over eastern South Carolina on Friday night and near or over eastern North Carolina on Saturday. The storm became a Category 1 hurricane Thursday afternoon, and is expected to lash the area with heavy rains.  ”These rains may cause   floods and flash floods. Heavy rain could reach the coastal   states from Virginia to New Jersey beginning early Saturday,” the National Hurricane Center said.  When Hermine makes landfall, it would be the first hurricane to do so in the state since Wilma in 2005. ”This is ” Gov Rick Scott told reporters in Tallahassee, the capital. ”The storm surge, by itself, is  .” Rain has been pounding the Gulf Coast ahead of the storm since Wednesday, and forecasters say much more is in store.  Hermine could bring up to 10 inches of additional rainfall to some places, including Tallahassee    with up to 15 inches possible in some areas    before dumping heavy rain in parts of Georgia and the eastern Carolinas, forecasters said. Forecasters said storm surge will be dangerous from Indian Pass to Longboat Key. Some areas could see surge as high as 9 feet. Live coastal video: Florida braces for Hermine, They warned residents to be aware of the potential for flooding. There was a tornado watch in effect for 26 Florida counties and 37 Georgia counties until 8 a. m. ET on Friday. On Thursday night, the storm's maximum sustained winds hit 80 mph. Forecasters warned that the storm is asymmetric, with much of the dangerous winds and rain to the east and southeast of the center. The National Weather Service has issued a new online product to help people prepare for the storm. The storm surge   graphic highlights spots with the highest risk for ”  inundation from storm surge,” the service said. See CNN's storm tracker, Surge 'is what got me worried right now' In Apalachicola, on the Panhandle coast, contractors Lake Smith and Joshua Wolfhagen boarded up windows at the Consulate, a   hotel in a   brick building about 60 feet from the waterfront. ”Storm (surge) is what got me worried right now,” Smith said. ”Mostly worried about washing out the roads and a few of the homes in   areas.” Wolfhagen said he feared Hermine would make for a significant disaster in Apalachicola and Franklin County    which he said could ultimately hurt his work. ”People . .. don't want to build a house where storms hit. We got a bunch of work after the storm (from 2005) but we slowed way down,” he said. Eddie Bass, who owns a home in Alligator Point, said he wasn't boarding up his home because he was much more worried about the storm surge. Bass, who left Tallahassee after packing up, said: ”It's not much you can do. You just got to bring everything you can. Lock down the house and pray.” A hurricane warning was in effect for the area between the Suwannee River westward to Mexico Beach.  Scott declared a state of emergency for 51 of the state's 67 counties. He ordered all state offices in those 51 counties to close by noon Thursday. In Panama City, a popular Labor Day destination, organizers canceled one of the major tourist draws, the Gulf Coast Jam. Officials said the stage and tent village for the   country music event need to be taken down as the winds pick up. Emergency management officials in Taylor County, along the Gulf Coast of Florida, said Thursday night that a curfew is in place beginning at 9 p. m. ET and mandatory evacuations have been ordered for coastal communities.  The agency said there is some flooding, but nothing major at this time.  Officials in nearby Wakulla County said there are also mandatory evacuations for   areas there.  Franklin County, just southeast of Panama City, issued a mandatory evacuation order for the coastal towns of St. George Island, Dog Island, Bald Point and Alligator Point, the county's emergency management office said. In St. Petersburg, well to the south, Joanna Crandell said the water in the canal next to her home was a foot over the sea wall. But high tide won't come until the middle of the night. ”I am sorry to say we have made no preparations for the hurricane, other then appropriate beverages, as we are only getting the outer bands,” said Crandell, who has lived in the area for 14 years. Residents have been sharing images of high water running through neighborhoods. In one, a man paddleboards down a street. A photo from Holmes Beach showed a woman floating on an air mattress in her driveway. Zika concerns, The storm may leave behind large areas of standing water, but one expert said it shouldn't increase fears over the Zika virus. ”We associate severe rain events like tropical events and hurricanes with increases in nuisance mosquitoes, not with   (mosquitoes),” Ben Beard, chief of the Bacterial Diseases Branch of CDC's Division of   Diseases, told CNN. The type of mosquito that could potentially carry Zika is affected by heavy rain and flooding, which also washes away larvae from small breeding sites such as bird baths and flower pots. Nuisance mosquitoes will breed in water that remains standing after the storm passes.  Other states declare emergencies, Farther north, Georgia Gov Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency for 56 counties in his state, parts of which are expected to get up to 10 inches of rain over the weekend. ”We are working to ensure counties in south, central and coastal Georgia have access to the state resources necessary to prepare when . .. Hermine enters Georgia,” Deal said Thursday. North Carolina Gov Pat McCrory issued a state of emergency for 33 eastern counties. The National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm watch for the   coast and New Jersey, extending to Sandy Hook, New Jersey. The hurricane center has extended a tropical storm warning to include the Outer Banks of North Carolina.  The projected track for Hermine brings the center of the storm over the coast of North Carolina on Saturday morning, then into the Atlantic Ocean that afternoon."
38521,57369,Trump doctor to CNN: No regrets about letter,CNN,Drew Griffin,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,," (CNN) Trump's doctor told CNN in an interview he stands by the letter he wrote for the Republican nominee vouching for his good health and has no regrets about being embroiled in the controversy over it. When asked if Trump has the physically capability of being president, Dr. Harold Bornstein told CNN's Drew Griffin on Thursday, ”Absolutely, no question about it.” Bornstein, a    NY City gastroenterologist, has been Trump's physician for more than three decades and came under scrutiny for an unusual letter he wrote in 2015 describing Trump's physical health, which other doctors have said includes strange wording, medically incorrect terms and an unprofessional conclusion. Trump's lab ”test results were astonishingly excellent,” he wrote, mimicking the grandiose verbiage of his  . ”If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” Bornstein told CNN that he was rushed for time when writing the letter since he had patients to see.  ”The only thing I wanted to do in my life is practice with my father, which I managed to do for 35 years.”   RELATED: Trump's doctor: Trump 'will be healthiest individual ever elected' president, Bornstein told CNN that his father started his medical practice at the same Park Avenue office location in 1947.  Trump was first under the care of his father Dr. Jacob Bornstein, according to the letter. Harold Bornstein joined the practice in 1980, and when his father passed away in 2010, continued it. When asked if he had any regrets about getting involved in the presidential election, Bornstein said, ”No. My patients, I take care of them the right way.” The CNN interview was cut short when Dr. Bornstein's wife approached, and covered the camera with her hand. Bornstein had warned it might happen. ”My wife will come back, she'll get angry,” he said as the interview began. At least four medical malpractice lawsuits have been filed against Dr. Harold Bornstein in the state of NY dating back to 1986. In a 1999 lawsuit, NY resident Kenneth Levin accused Bornstein of negligence in failing to properly diagnose and treat his wife by ”overmedicating” her with prescription drugs and not following proper medical procedures, which Levin argued led to her death. The case argues Bornstein ”prescribed unnecessary barbiturates and other drugs to the decedent with full knowledge that these medications were not necessary” and that some were ”greatly in excess of appropriate dosages.” RELATED: Clinton's health is fine, but what about Trump? Bornstein denied the allegations and settled the case in 2002 for $86, 000 with no finding of liability. Another case charged both Bornstein and his father of recklessness in overdosing and improperly performing a colonoscopy on Vincent Pollifrone, which the case argued led to his death in 2000. The case was disposed in 2006, after the defendants denied the claims. The plaintiff's lawyer in that case, Joseph Miklos, told CNN the parties signed a confidentiality agreement so he could not discuss the terms of any settlement. When asked about the lawsuits Thursday, Bornstein defended his credentials and said the number of malpractice suits he has faced is ”normal.” Professor David Studdert of Stanford University, an expert on health law who has tracked data on medical malpractice lawsuits, said gastroenterologists such as Bornstein have about a 10% chance of facing a new medical malpractice suit each year. ”Over a career, it would be the norm rather than the exception that a gastroenterologist would have a few claims filed against him. That's not an outlier situation,” Studdert said. Dr. G Kevin Donovan, a bioethicist at Georgetown University Medical School, agrees that the existence of four disposed malpractice suits does not provide enough information to draw conclusions about Bornstein, but he said Bornstein's letter describing Trump's health is light on detail and heavy on bombast. RELATED: Trump's health care plan: What he promises and what it really says  Donovan said most physicians ”don't use that kind of hyperbole for a medical statement.” Donovan added that most letters written by doctors for presidential candidates contain a level of subjectivity since candidates select the doctors who write their assessments and can stipulate what information they include. ”They can only tell us what the candidate allows them to reveal,” Donovan said, adding, ”Is it likely that a candidate would go to a physician that would not speak well of them?” Former patients and a classmate of Bornstein reached by CNN described him as competent yet eccentric. NY resident Roger Friedman, who said he was a patient of Bornstein's in the 80's and early 90's, said he was surprised when he recently heard Bornstein had treated Trump for decades. ”He was a good doctor but he was peculiar, disorganized, and not at the level you expect for a billionaire,” Friedman said.  Angelina Kaiserman, a NY jeweler who told CNN she has been in Bornstein's care for more than 20 years, said, ”Honestly I give him five stars.” Dr. Edward Hurwitz, who attended medical school with Bornstein at Tufts University in the class of 1975, remembers Bornstein making sarcastic comments in class and often writing elaborate poems with colorful language he would share with friends. ”He was snide with his comments but he was certainly smart,” Hurwitz said."
38524,57372,Zika spraying kills millions of honeybees,CNN,,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,," (CNN) The pictures are heartbreaking: Millions of honeybees lie dead after being sprayed with an insecticide targeting   mosquitoes.  ”On Saturday, it was total energy, millions of bees foraging, pollinating, making honey for winter,” beekeeper Juanita Stanley said. ”Today, it stinks of death. Maggots and other insects are feeding on the honey and the baby bees who are still in the hives. It's heartbreaking.” Stanley,   of Flowertown Bee Farm and Supply in Summerville, South Carolina, said she lost 46 beehives    more than 3 million bees    in mere minutes after the spraying began Sunday morning. ”Those that didn't die immediately were poisoned trying to drag out the dead,” Stanley said. ”Now, I'm going to have to destroy my hives, the honey, all my equipment. It's all contaminated.” Stanley said Summerville Fire Capt. Andrew Macke, who keeps bees as a hobby, also lost thousands of bees. She said neither of them had protected their hives because they didn't know about the aerial spraying.  ”Andrew has two hives,” Stanley said. ”He didn't know they were going to spray. His wife called him. His bees are at their porch right by their home, and she saw dead bees everywhere.” It's a tragedy that could be repeated across the country as cases of Zika continue to rise and local mosquito control districts struggle to protect their residents and ease local fears. The spray fell from the skies between 6:30 and 8:30 a. m. Sunday. It was the first aerial spraying in 14 years, according to Dorchester County Administrator Jason Ward, part of the county's efforts to combat Zika after four local residents were diagnosed with the virus.  ”We chose Sunday morning because few people would be out and about that early on a weekend,” Ward said. ”To protect the bees, you don't want to spray after the sun has been up more two hours, so we scheduled it early.” The county used a product called Trumpet, which contains the pesticide naled, recommended by the EPA and the CDC for control of adult Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that transmits Zika.  According to the manufacturer's label (PDF) Trumpet is ”highly toxic to bees exposed to direct treatment on blooming crops or weeds. To minimize hazard to bees, it is recommended that the product is not applied more than two hours after sunrise or two hours before sunset, limiting application to times when bees are least active.” ”We followed that recommendation,” said Ward, ”which is also the policy laid out by the state, using a pesticide the state has approved for use.” Ward says the county also notified residents of the spraying by posting a notice on its website at 9 a. m. Friday, two days before the spraying. He added that it alerted beekeepers who were on the local mosquito control registry by phone or email, a common practice before truck spraying. ”That's true when they sprayed by trucks they told me in advance, and we talked about it so I could protect my bees,” Stanley said. ”But nobody called me about the aerial spraying nobody told me at all.”  Stanley said she ”would have been screaming and pleading on their doorstep if they had.” ” 'Do it at night when bees are done foraging,' I would have told them,” she added, breaking into tears. ”But they sprayed at 8 a. m. Sunday, and all of my bees were out, doing their work by then.”  Macke was also not informed, Ward said, because he, like many hobby beekeepers, is not on the local mosquito control registry.  ”We are obviously saddened by the fact people have lost their hives, and we have gone back and looked at our procedures,” Ward said. ”We will now give up to five days of advance notice, and we have expanded our list to include more local beekeepers.” Stanley says she doesn't think there was malice involved, but that doesn't make the loss of her ”honey girls” any less painful. ”This wasn't about the honey,” she said. ”It was about raising bees and selling them to other people, and spreading the honey girls out there into the world. Now, I can't help anyone anymore, because all of them are dead.”"
38525,57373,Report: Iran granted exemptions to nuclear accord,CNN,Elise Labott,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Washington (CNN) The US and other members of the international community granted Iran exemptions to its requirements under the agreement that sought to curb its nuclear program, according to a new report by the   Institute for Science and International Security. The alleged granting of ”secret” exemptions to Iran by the Joint Commission, the deal's implementing body, is likely to thrust the controversial accord, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) back into the political spotlight.  The report says ”most of the conditions” laid out in the agreement ”were met by Iran” but it also claims Iran would have not been in compliance by January 16, 2016, the deal's   Implementation Day, without the exemptions to the requirement that Iran limit its stockpile of low enriched uranium to under  . The exemptions supposedly pertained to uranium in ”waste form,” according to the report, but the authors noted that that waste was potentially recoverable.  The report's authors, David Albright and Andrea Stricker, went on to blast Obama's administration for keeping these exemptions secret.   ”Any rationale for keeping these exemptions secret appears unjustified,” the report said. Albright told CNN that the additional low enriched uranium could reduce the amount of time needed for Iran to develop a nuclear bomb if it decided to break the accord.   The report said another exemption allowed Iran to operate 19 ”hot cells” larger than specified in the accords, larger hot cells could be used to produce plutonium, which can also be used to produce a nuclear weapon.  ”We were also worried that these exemptions or decisions by the Joint Commission set bad precedents that Iran is going to use to try and further weaken the conditions of the Iran deal,” added Albright, a physicist and expert on Iran's nuclear program. The report's conclusions were first published by Reuters.  The State Department pushed back Thursday on the report's findings but noted that the workings of the Joint Commission were always confidential and therefore declined to discuss specifics of the commission's work. ”The Joint Commission has not and will not loosen any of the commitments and has not provided any exceptions that would allow Iran to retain or process material In excess of its (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) limits that it could use in a breakout scenario,” State Department spokesman John Kirby said Thursday. ”There's been no cutting of slack,” he added.  The White House also criticized the report Thursday, with spokesman Josh Earnest saying the administration had ”significant objections” to it. ”Iran is in compliance with the agreement. That's not my opinion. That's not rhetoric. That is not a conjecture. That is a fact that is verified by independent international experts who, because of the agreement, now have the kind of access that is required to verify it,” Earnest said. Kirby said that the International Atomic Energy Agency had also confirmed that Iran was fulfilling its obligations under the deal, noting that Iran's ”breakout” period for obtaining a nuclear weapon had been extended from several months to a year as a result of the deal. A senior State Department official offered an even more strident rebuttal, telling CNN, ”The USA and its partners did not and will not allow Iran to skirt its JCPOA commitments.” The official said that Iran met all of its commitments on implementation day and that ”Any assertion to the contrary is completely false.” ”Iran has never been over its 300 kilogram limit for low enriched uranium,” the official added.  The White House also criticized the report Thursday, with spokesman Josh Earnest saying the administration had ”significant objections.” ”Iran is in compliance with the agreement. That's not my opinion. That's not rhetoric. That is not a conjecture. That is a fact that is verified by independent international experts who, because of the agreement, now have the kind of access that is required to verify it,” Earnest said. Republicans were quick to use the report's conclusions to criticize the administration. ”This latest report further confirms that the Obama administration has consistently misled the American people on the Iran nuclear deal,” the Republican Jewish Coalition wrote in a statement.  Albright sounded a pessimistic note on the future of the agreement during his interview with CNN. ”The trend, in my mind, is not good. It's toward weakening the deal instead of strengthening the deal,” he said. Iran recently announced an expansion of its civilian nuclear capabilities, saying that construction will begin on two more   nuclear reactors at the Bushehr nuclear power plant next week, according to the country's atomic energy chief quoted on   IRNA Wednesday."
38527,57375,"Venezuela protests: Demonstrators flood streets, demand recall vote",CNN,Catherine E. Shoichet,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) Protesters packed the streets of Venezuela's capital Thursday, demanding a recall vote to remove President Nicolas Maduro from power. Wearing white and waving flags as they marched, demonstrators blamed Maduro's government for food shortages and major economic problems. ”There is no food. There is no paper. There is no medicine. We are dying,” Maria Alvarez told CNN en Español. ”Please, help Venezuela. This has to end. Maduro, you have to understand that your time is up.” Opposition leaders dubbed the massive demonstration ”The Takeover of Caracas” and said they hoped the peaceful protest would have a historic turnout. Crowd estimates varied greatly    depending on who was making them.   The opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democratica, claimed more than 1 million people took part. But the   news agency AVN said that only about 30, 000 people attended the   march, Protesters filled three major avenues in the east of Caracas. Images of the protests showed throngs of people in plazas and roadways. Government warns of violence, Tensions were clear as officers in riot gear stood face to face with lines of demonstrators. So far, the situation has remained peaceful.  But supporters of the opposition have warned that the government could be gearing up for a crackdown. Venezuelan officials say the opposition has a nefarious aim: violence in the streets.  State television broadcast video of supporters of the government rallying in a large ” ” protest.  Maduro told crowds clad in red that authorities had detained   opposition leaders who were planning to plant bombs in the capital. He pressed his supporters to be ready in case of a coup. ”If a day comes and you see that something happens to President Nicolas Maduro . .. go into the streets and get justice,” he said. In recent days, the government has detained at least six opposition leaders, accusing them of conspiring against the government. ”Those detained have a history of destabilizing acts in our country, and it cannot be ruled out that there will be more detentions of   elements of the Venezuelan ” Interior and Justice Minister Nestor Reverol said this week. Maduro told supporters that he was signing a decree to strip lawmakers of their immunity so they can face prosecution for crimes. The opposition holds the majority of seats in Venezuela's National Assembly. 'Maduro is afraid!' Speaking to demonstrators, opposition leader Henrique Capriles accused government officials of trying to block people from reaching the protests. Government threats won't make the opposition back down, said Capriles, who narrowly lost to Maduro in a 2013 election after longtime leader Hugo Chavez's death. ”Maduro is afraid! The more obstacles there are, the more people will peacefully be in the streets!” Capriles wrote on Twitter. Opposition leaders said Thursday's march was the first of many protests they plan to hold as they push for a referendum. Maria Corina Machado, an opposition leader who's been a vocal critic of Maduro, said the large turnout sent a clear message. ”Today in the streets we demonstrated that a new phase of the fight has begun. The transition is urgent and inevitable,” she wrote on Twitter. For months, opposition parties have been pushing for the government to hold a referendum on Maduro's presidency. Many Venezuelans have lost patience with the socialist president amid widespread shortages of food and medical supplies, surging crime levels, rolling blackouts and massive inflation. Experts predict Venezuela's economy will shrink by 10% this year, while inflation will rise by 700%.  Venezuelan officials say they aren't to blame for the country's mounting problems they accuse the political right of carrying out an economic war to undermine the government.

38528,57376,Polaris recalls two off-road models due to fire hazard,CNN,,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,," (CNN) A fire hazard has prompted Polaris Industries Inc. to recall two models of recreational   vehicles, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday. The engine can overheat, and the turbo system's drain tube can loosen, possibly causing a fire.  The   company said it received 19 reports of the ROVs catching fire, resulting in six burn injuries. One of the fires, occurring in Utah's American Fork Canyon, caused severe burns on a young child and destroyed 15 acres of forest land, the commission reported. People should immediately stop using the ROVs and contact Polaris to schedule a free repair. All   2016 Polaris RZR XP Turbo and RZR XP 4 Turbo ROVs need to be returned. Vehicles were purchased at dealers nationwide between August 2015 and July 2016.  The recall includes nearly 13, 000 vehicles, including 2, 230 ROVs recalled in December. ”Polaris” is stamped onto the front grille of the ROVs, sold in blue, gray, orange and red. ”RZR” is printed on the rear box or on the right and left rear fenders and ”Turbo” on the hood or on the right and left front fenders. At least 900 deaths over a   period were related to   vehicles or ATVs being ridden on paved roads or parking lots, according to the safety commission. During the same period, nearly 3, 000 deaths and 490, 000 injuries related to ATVs and ROVs were reported. Overturning is a common risk when driving an   vehicle on a paved surface, since ATVs and ROVs are designed for   terrains. These vehicles are also more likely to collide with cars, trucks and other vehicles, said the commission. In advance of the holiday weekend, the agency reminded the public that riders need to wear helmets and protective gear, including boots, gloves, eye protectors, long pants and   shirts, and seat belts must be used. Most ATVs are designed for one rider passengers should never exceed seats.  Riders younger than 16 should not drive adult vehicles, and children cannot ride as passengers unless their feet touch the floor in a sitting position, the safety commission said."
38529,57377,Clinton camp smashes fundraising record: $143 million in August,CNN,,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,," (CNN) Clinton's presidential campaign raised $143 million in August for her campaign, the DNC and state parties, according to a campaign press release, a haul that makes the month the best of her campaign. The fundraising haul is a silver lining on what otherwise was a difficult month for Clinton, where questions about her exclusive use of a private email server as secretary of state and questions about    at the ClintonFoundation hamstrung her campaign. National polls have tightened since the Democratic National Convention in July, but Clinton maintains leads in almost all battleground states. With their massive August haul, the Clinton campaign starts September with more than $68 million in the bank, while her joint fundraising accounts have a combined $84 million in the bank. Clinton campaign unmoved by press squawks over lack of press conferences, ”Thanks to the 2. 3 million people who have contributed to our campaign, we are heading into the final two months of the race with the resources we need to organize and mobilize millions of voters across the country,” Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement. ”These resources will help us to register and turnout millions of voters to elect progressive candidates across the country.” For comparison,  . Obama raised Obama's campaign raised $66 million in August 2008 and $150 million in September 2008. Clinton headlined 37 fundraisers in August, raising her campaign close to $70 million in the process, according to CNN's estimate based on average ticket prices and attendance figures provided by the Clinton campaign. Clinton's events    which took her to 12 states    raised $67. 9 million, according to CNN's calculations. That haul smashes what she has personally raised during previous months and put her on pace to make August her biggest fundraising month of the campaign. Tom   group targets millennials to help Democrats in North Carolina, One key reason Clinton is able to raise these large sums of money: The Hillary Victory Fund, a joint fundraising account that allows the Democratic ticket to raise money for her campaign, the Democratic National Committee and Democratic state parties at the same time. These agreements allow Clinton's donors to give $366, 400 to a number of different Democratic accounts through the Clinton campaign. An analysis by Bloomberg found that the Hillary Victory Fund allowed hundreds of donors who had maxed out their donations to the Democratic National Committee to give more money through the joint fundraising agreement. According to the Clinton campaign, $62 million of their total haul in August was for the campaign, while about $81 million was raised for the Democratic National Committee through the Hillary Victory Fund and the Hillary Action Fund. First on CNN:   super PAC reserves $6M in ads aimed at minorities, Clinton's month was anchored by two   swings    one through California and another through NY. The former secretary of state raised over $19 million during a   nine fundraiser swing through California earlier this month. She topped that haul this week during a similar   nine fundraiser haul through the Hamptons and surrounding towns, bringing in over $21 million in the process. Clinton's month was   as well.  Debate prep reveals clash of styles for Clinton, Trump, Jimmy Buffett hosted Clinton at his Sag Harbor home earlier this month, serenading the crowd with Sir Paul McCartney, a music icon and one of the frontmen from The Beatles, and Jon Bon Jovi. During her trip to California, Clinton headlined events hosted by singer songwriter Justin Timberlake, actress Jessica Biel, actor Tobey Maguire,   Scooter Braun, Hall of Fame basketball player Magic Johnson and actors Denzel Washington and Samuel L. Jackson. Clinton visited the following states on the fundraising trial this month: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, NY, Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the District of Columbia. Clinton's biggest fundraiser of the month was a $6. 6 million event in the Hamptons hosted by Jonathan Tisch,   of the NY Giants. Tim Kaine headlined 33 fundraisers this month, bringing in a more modest $12 million, according to estimates, meaning together the   ticket raise around $80 million at fundraisers they personally headlined."
38530,57378,Operation removes Gadhafi-era chemical weapons materials from Libya,CNN,Ryan Browne,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Washington (CNN) Chemical   materials developed during Moammar Gadhafi's   rule were removed from Libya as part of an international maritime operation, US officials said Thursday. The   operation took place Saturday and was coordinated by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). It was conducted in accordance with a UN resolution at the request of the Libyan Government of National Accord (GNA) according to a statement issued by National Security Council spokesman Ned Price. Price called the 500 tons that was removed ”the remains of the chemical weapons stockpile accumulated by Moammar Gadhafi's regime.” A UK naval vessel helped escort the Danish ship bearing the chemicals out of Libya, according to a statement issued by the British government. The Royal Navy ship ”will help ensure chemical weapons precursors do not fall into the hands of extremist groups, including Daesh,” UK Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said, using another term for ISIS. A recent   report accused ISIS of carrying out a chemical weapons attack in Syria. The OPCW said in a statement that the US, along with nine other countries, assisted through the provision of personnel, technical expertise, equipment, financial and other resources. A US defense official told CNN that while it was aware of and supportive of the effort, the US military was not involved in the removal operation.  Meanwhile, the Pentagon said Thursday that forces aligned to the GNA continue to make gains against ISIS in its former stronghold in the coastal city of Sirte, Libya. US Navy Capt. Jeff Davis told reporters that ISIS only retained control over three neighborhoods and that the terror group was being driven into the sea.  ”Literally, their backs are against the ocean,” Davis said, adding that Libyan naval vessels were preventing ISIS from fleeing via the water. Davis estimated that less than 200 ISIS fighters remained in the city. The US has conducted 108 airstrikes against ISIS in Libya since operation Odyssey Lightning began August 1 in at the request of the GNA with four of the strikes taking place Wednesday, Davis said."
38531,57379,U.S. Open 2016: Murray wins under new roof,CNN,,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,," (CNN) The new roof at the U. S. Open is being put to good use.  Organizers used the roof    build at a cost of $150 million    for the first time in tournament history in Wednesday's night session but it proved especially beneficial Thursday after rain hit NY in the morning and afternoon.  In years past, the precipitation would have meant no play at all at the year's final major, prompting reruns    for TV viewers    of old matches. However, cover over Arthur Ashe stadium ensured the action wasn't significantly disrupted on the biggest regularly used tennis court in the world.  Play on outer courts was, mind you, severely affected.  Andy Murray usually plays on center court wherever he goes and the Scot was no doubt thrilled to be given a slot on Arthur Ashe stadium given the gloomy forecast.  Murray has appeared in the three previous grand slam finals this season    winning Wimbledon in July    and is the most   player in tennis, having also won singles gold at the Olympics last month. This while world No. 1 Novak Djokovic, affected by wrist and arm injuries, has cooled. Murray progressed to the third round by beating Marcel Granollers       in a competitive 2   hour contest that featured extended rallies and more than a few drop shots from the Spaniard.  Murray    who won the U. S. Open in 2012 after claiming the junior title in 2004    enjoyed his time under the roof although it took the second seed a while to get used to the rain pelting down on the roof.  ”I didn't know what it was at the beginning,” Murray told Eurosport. ”Neither of us did and then obviously when (we) realized it was the rain there's nothing you can do about that. It's so loud. I've never played like that before. ”You can't hear the ball. Tennis players do pick up the sound of the ball to read the spins a little bit earlier and the speed of the serve, so it makes it tricky.  ”It's something that you need to adjust to and get used to. After a few games it was okay but at the start it's tricky.” Simona Halep began play on Ashe and in another entertaining tussle, defeated fellow French Open finalist Lucie Safarova    .  ”I had a nice feeling,” Halep told reporters. ”It was a great experience to be there. I didn't have to wait for the rain, so that's a good thing.” Halep is considered one of only a sprinkling of players able to challenge Serena Williams for the women's title, with the list dwindling after Garbine Muguruza    who beat Williams in the French Open final    was upset Wednesday. The Romanian is   in her last 21 matches.  Could Venus Williams win a first major in eight years? There's still plenty of tennis to be played in NY but the    remains in contention after easing past Germany's Julia Goerges     to end the day session on Ashe. She will be buoyed by her performance at Wimbledon, having achieved a grand slam semifinal for the first time since 2010.  Visit CNN's tennis page for more tennis stories, Among winners on the outer courts when the rain relented were 2014 finalist Kei Nishikori and French Open semifinalist Dominic Thiem. "
38532,57380,What a Trump win would mean for LGBT equality,CNN,,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,," (CNN) Recently, ISIS pushed four men off a building in Mosul because they were suspected of being gay. Last month, the Ugandan government detained citizens attending a pride parade and ordered them beaten by other inmates. In Bangladesh, the editor of the nation's only LGBTQ magazine was recently found hacked to death. As we consider what the 2016 election will mean for LGBTQ equality across the USA, we also can't forget what this election will mean for our global community. Trump has spent his campaign threatening to undo crucial protections for LGBTQ people in the USA, vowing to appoint judges to the Supreme Court to turn back the legalization of   marriage and supporting   discrimination against transgender people. He has courted extremists who foment hate both here and export it abroad.  His running mate, Pence, as a congressman in 2009, opposed language in federal legislation to monitor and combat human rights violations against LGBTQ people abroad, accusing Democrats of attempting to ”promote a gay rights agenda around the globe.”  Trump has also sought support from leading exporters of   hate, including the Alliance Defending Freedom. Well known for the work it does within US borders, ADF is also spreading hate in countries around the world, from fighting equality in Russia to recruiting and training   activists in Nepal. Together, Trump and Pence seem to have little interest in    and perhaps little understanding of    the dire plight faced by asylum seekers, including those who seek to flee the violence of ISIS or escape the   regime in Russia.  And yet, Trump says he's a friend to the LGBTQ community. But let's look at what he would actually do. Recently, Trump proposed an ideology test on new immigrants that would require those coming into the USA to show they are, among other things, tolerant of LGBTQ people. Putting aside the fact that he and Pence would apparently fail their own ideology test on several fronts, the very existence of such a vetting policy would create another obstacle for refugees  —  including LGBTQ people fleeing countries where they can literally be put to death simply because of who they are. By contrast, today    thanks to the work of Clinton as secretary of state, and others    LGBTQ people can receive priority resettlement because they face a significant threat of violence, torture, and even death in the countries they are leaving. The policy also prioritizes other vulnerable groups such as children, widows and older refugees, as well as targeted communities like religious and ethnic minorities. While Trump was busy cozying up to Vladimir Putin back in 2011, Clinton was declaring before the international community that ”gay rights are human rights.” She was creating the Global Equality Fund, which supports human rights defenders working to protect LGBTQ people in more than 80 countries. She was also helping ensure the United Nations Human Rights Council passed its very first resolution on sexual orientation and gender identity in 2011.  In Clinton, the LGBTQ community has a leader who was not only willing to make historic commitments through our foreign policy, but has taken action. Trump and Pence pose a clear threat to equality here in the USA, particularly when it comes to marriage equality, basic civil rights protections and the makeup of our Supreme Court. But let's also consider what's on the line for the gay teen living in Jamaica or the transgender woman living in Honduras or the men living in daily fear of being exposed, targeted and murdered by ISIS. For them, our foreign policy can mean life or death. In a   administration, does anyone think human rights for all will remain a pillar of our foreign policy? Or that our embassies abroad will provide the same beacon of hope to local LGBTQ communities? Or that whomever Trump selects as his secretary of state or UN ambassador will go before the international community to fight against discrimination and violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity?  Would Trump stand up against hateful legislation in countries like Russia and Uganda when he's endorsed the ability of US states to legalize discrimination? The answers to all of those questions are: clearly not. This election is about many crucial issues of great importance here at home. But we can't forget that we also hold lives in our hands around the globe. Who we elect as our next president will either destroy the progress we've made or continue building toward a world where all LGBTQ people are safe from violence, discrimination and fear."
38534,57382,The search for a Speedo-wearing guru,CNN,Ann O'Neill,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Honolulu (CNN)”Dipsh*t!” ”Dumb ass!”  ”Call off your psychotic Chihuahua wife!”  So much for peace, love and good karma. We're attending a screening at the 27th annual Honolulu Rainbow Film Festival, and midway through a QA session with the cast of tonight's documentary the mood turns dark, more like ”Friday Night Fights.” The circle of security guards tightens, just in case. People in the front rows get ready to duck. Some stand and approach the stage. Are these two dudes, a yoga teacher and a hairdresser by trade, really about to start swinging? What in the name of holy hell is going on? ”Holy Hell,” in fact, is the reason everyone is packed into the Doris Duke Theatre at the Honolulu Museum of Art on a steamy Friday night in August. It's the name of Will Allen's documentary, backed by Academy      Jared Leto, and it tells the story of how Allen and his friends spent more than two decades in a New   spiritual group they called the Buddhafield.  In his search for enlightenment, Allen followed an eccentric,   guru from West Hollywood to Austin, Texas, and then to Hawaii's Lanikai Beach, about a   drive from this theater. One night about 10 years ago, he simply left the guru behind, here in Hawaii.  He walked away in the wake of allegations that the guru had been sexually abusing young male followers for years. Allen says he was one of them. In the decade since, Allen and his Buddhafield friends have moved on, but a new group has grown up in their place. So Allen has come back to Hawaii to lay his film at the feet of his former guru. He sees ”Holy Hell” as a cautionary tale, and wants people here to know what happened to him and his friends    so it won't happen to them.  That's why fear and loathing are sweeping the yoga studios of Oahu, and why death threats are being reported to police. It's why people are eyeing each other at the Whole Foods store in the Kailua Town Center and wondering, ”Are you in that cult?”  And it's why Murti Hower and Jentry Petzold look like they're about to throttle each other up on stage.  The two men met in Austin and say they love each other like brothers. But there's one big difference between them: Hower, one of the original Buddhafield recruiters featured in the film, no longer follows the teacher. As for Petzold, well, all he'll say is his relationship with the teacher is far more cordial.  Petzold and another emissary, Martin Doluz, insist they aren't in a cult, and that their guru isn't brainwashing or sexually abusing anybody. The both say they owe him everything. The loose collection of followers, many tied into Oahu's yoga and   communities, isn't organized enough to qualify as a ”group,” they insist.  It doesn't even have a name.  But the others on stage    director Allen and some who appear in the film, Hower, Chris Johnston, Julian Goldstein, Radhia Gleis and Alessandra Burenin    all say they were brainwashed and manipulated. Looking back, they have no doubt that the Buddhafield was a cult.  Along the way, they say, they lost their spiritual innocence, their identities and even their ability to make decisions for themselves.  Now they say they're hearing disturbing things from friends on the island, that the master they knew as Andreas is not laying low, as he'd promised them he would. He's collecting new acolytes and calling himself ”Reyji.” It means ” .”  Concerned neighbors say he has taken to walking the streets of Lanikai in disguise    with a cane and wearing a white surgical mask. But Doluz insists that's another spiritual leader who has taken up residence on the island with a band of followers.  But, just before the film festival, Andreas moved to a bigger, more secure home nearby. Alllen's spies are calling this compound ”The Fortress.”  Those close to Reyji see the filmmaker's actions as an aggression. This impression is underscored when a mass mailing marketing the film hits every mailbox within a   radius of Lanikai Beach.  ”The film he doesn't want you to see,” says one side of a postcard announcing that ”Holy Hell” is available on iTunes, Amazon and soon will be on Netflix. (The documentary also airs on CNN at 9 p. m. Thursday.)  Hower, meanwhile, says he's being harassed, more so now that the film is being shown on the island he calls home. He's afraid of what will happen when everybody else goes home. The   fireworks with Petzold blow over. Still, tensions run high in the community as ”Holy Hell” is unleashed on the unsuspecting island of Oahu. From Will to Francesco  I meet Will Allen for the first time at the Novel Café in Santa Monica, California, not far from his place. It's the type of neighborhood where people who are into meditation, yoga and kale feel right at home.  A quick breakfast turns into a   talkathon. He seems funny and sweet, and there is a boyish innocence about him. I wonder if that's what happens when you go a couple of decades without carrying the responsibilities of kids and a   day job.  Allen is 53 now, with flecks of gray in his tousled mop of hair, but he spent the years 22 to 44 inside the Buddhafield. He was just out of college, a bit adrift, when a sister introduced him to the group in West Hollywood. He says he was a prime recruit, and vulnerable. He'd just come out as gay, and his mother hadn't taken it as well as he'd hoped. In fact, he says, she kicked him out of the family home in an upscale neighborhood in Southern California. At 22, Allen didn't know if he wanted to be a filmmaker, although it had been his dream for as long as he could remember. Now, three decades later, he is one.  And, as the Buddhafield's official videographer, he's sitting on what might be the largest collection of tapes showing life inside a   cult.  Make no mistake: Life inside the Buddhafield did take on some of the widely accepted hallmarks of a cult. Members' egos and identities were stripped away. Most followers didn't get to keep the names they came with they were assigned new ones. The group's focus shifted subtly over the years instead of delving into themselves for enlightenment, members of the Buddhafield were encouraged to worship their guru. One acolyte, Julian Goldstein, showed his devotion by carving elaborate fruit salads his masterpiece was the Last Supper.  Will's name was changed to Francesco. One day in Hawaii, before his film is screened, I shoot him a text about all the events he's juggling, noting that it can't be easy to be Will Allen. He responds, ”It wasn't easy being Francesco, either.”  The Buddhafield had caught the attention of   Rick Ross by the early 1990s. So the guru simply packed up and left in the middle of the night, checking out the legendary vortexes of Sedona, Arizona, before ultimately relocating in Austin. Radhia Gleis, a former member, says she supplied the down payment for a sprawling ranch house on enough acreage to accommodate koi ponds and an aviary.  The guru, who had been going by ”Michel,” changed his own name to ”Andreas.” It's the name most followers know him by, although more recent acolytes occasionally let a ”Reyji” slip out.  Even people who have known him for more than 25 years are sketchy on the details, but they say he was born Jaime Gomez, the son of a wealthy Venezuelan rancher. He came to the USA in search of Hollywood stardom and legally changed his name to Michel Rostand.  His claim to fame, they say, was a nonspeaking role in a party scene in the Roman Polanski classic ”Rosemary's Baby.” He boasted of having danced with the Oakland Ballet. And former followers say he apparently starred in some gay adult films as well, but they were initially unaware of his porn career.  Many of his followers met the guru at weekly yoga and meditation sessions.  He led them on weekend outings to rivers and mountaintops and rocky beaches, where they frolicked, shed their   meditated and got in touch with their inner children.  The highlight of these sessions was an exercise they called shakti, a transfer of energy between master and student. At its most intense, a student experiences shakti as something akin to an LSD trip with flashing lights and vibrant colors    and an overwhelming sense of bliss.  And then there was ”The Knowing,” no less than making a direct connection with God. It wasn't given to all, but it's what kept people coming back.  It was all too beautiful. Until, they say, it wasn't. Boundaries, Will Allen says ”Holy Hell” merely tells his personal story    what happened to him, and to some of his friends during their years inside the Buddhafield. His story is intimate but  .  He is not an angry narrator he stands back a bit from his own misadventure, gently wondering: How could this happen?  That soft tone, along with hours and hours of insider footage, provide an alluring yet deeply disturbing view of life inside a cult.  But Allen has never been satisfied with the closing scenes of his movie. They depict a trip to Oahu, and a surreptitiously videotaped encounter with the guru on a public beach. It isn't much of a confrontation, instead playing out like an awkward chance meeting with an ex.  ”Are you being a good boy?” Allen asks, and the guru pushes back, saying he is less concerned with ”good” and more interested in what is ”best.” ”Are you being your best boy?” Allen persists, and the guru just smiles cryptically and says, ”I'm just being.”  That was at the outset of Allen's   film project. A lot has happened since then. Allen says he cried every day he worked on ”Holy Hell.”  Hawaii is stirring up some emotions. It's the place Allen says the guru first initiated sex with him. And, years later, it was the place where he finally decided to leave the Buddhafield afer 22 years. Still, he doesn't hesitate when I ask him to help me find Reyji    or people who know him    so I can hear another side of the story. Allen agrees, partly because he's a nice, helpful guy. Perhaps, there's an even more powerful motivator for a filmmaker: curiosity.  We drive the Lanikai Beach neighborhood, up narrow residential streets that wind into the hills from the beach. Allen rides shotgun and navigates, with some   help from Chris Johnston, who appears in the film. We find the house where Allen filmed Reyji before, and neighbors say he's been there until very recently. The yard is overgrown, and a tall fence is posted with ”No Trespassing” signs. Although Reyji must be well into his 70s by now, neighbors report that the guru still strolls down the street in his Speedo.  We are trying to figure out the best way to approach people who are friendly with Reyji when Allen spots somebody he recognizes behind the wheel of a pickup. We turn around and follow the truck up the hill. It comes to rest at a carport in front of a hillside home with a killer view.  We chat for a bit with Alan, who won't give his last name and says he is no longer with the group.  As he speaks, Alan stares into the distance with the bluest eyes I've ever seen. His pupils are tiny, his squint unwavering. This won't be the last intense,   stare I'll witness over the weekend.   A young woman with long, strawberry blond hair arrives and immediately lights into Will Allen. How dare he? How dare he film her and use her image without permission?  They get into an animated conversation it turns out that she can be seen in the crowd in one of the final scenes. Allen points out that she was filmed in public, and that to most viewers she's just a passing face in the crowd.  She accuses him of ”diminishing” her and once again they start arguing. This time, she lashes out: ”You're interrupting. That's the fourth time you've interrupted me.”  And, speaking of boundaries . .. ”Aren't you on my property?” Allen says he'd been invited up to talk with Alan, who hadn't objected when I tagged along. Still, we take it as our cue to go.  I leave them with my contact information I'm very interested, I assure them, in their point of view.  That night, at the first showing of the film, I encounter Petzold, there to represent Team Reyji. He promises to relay a message to the teacher. We decide to scale back our guru hunt and let things play out. No point in spooking him.  Reyji has seen the film, and it saddens him, say those professing to be close to him. While dealing with Petzold, I hear from Martin Doluz. He is a yoga teacher who describes himself as a ”good friend” in daily,    contact with the guru.  The first half of the movie showed an experience similar to his own, he said. ”Beautiful.” But not the second half of the movie. That was nothing like his experience. And, like the blond woman in the driveway, he didn't appreciate being shown without his permission in a film about a cult.  Doluz suggests I might actually get to meet the guru. But, by the end of a lengthy conversation that includes some deep   on Doluz's part, I am advised not to change my travel plans. Instead, a couple of days later Doluz and Petzold each pass along an emailed statement from ”Michel.”   ”It is heartbreaking to see how history has been rewritten,” the statement begins. ” 'Holy Hell' is not a documentary, rather, it is a work of fiction designed to create drama, fear and persecution, knowing that is what sells.” The statement continues, with a personal appeal to his former followers:  ”I am saddened by this attempt to obscure the message of universal love and spiritual awakening. It is devastating to see these friends, who were once so filled with love for the world, become so angry. I wish them only the best, and hold each one close to my heart. If any of my actions were a catalyst for their disharmony, I am truly sorry.” And he ends with a wish: ”May all beings find peace.” Supporters of the guru argue that he's harmless. Petzold says the former members featured in ”Holy Hell” seem to suffer from ”a bad case of buyer's remorse.”  Any sexual contact, the guru's supporters say, was consensual and came within the context of   relationships. It isn't happening now, they insist. Doluz says that ”even if that should be offered,” a disciple can always turn down a sexual advance.  Allen and his friends, Goldstein and Johnston, argue that they were never interested in their guru sexually. They all were much younger than   when they say he groomed them and turned them into his concubines. He was a creature of habit, and they say he reserved a day for each of them: Allen was Thursdays, Goldstein was Tuesdays and Saturdays, and Johnston, who is straight, always drew Mondays. They had been taught to bow in submission as a way to connect with God. That was how their guru groomed them, they say.    But submission should never be confused with consent, they insist. How can you consent to sex with somebody who has power over you, who holds the key to your spiritual enlightenment?  ”How can you equate that to consent when the imbalance of power is so great?” Johnston asks.  It is an argument similar to those made by survivors of clergy abuse scandals. Something else he says in the film seems to resonate with audiences, no matter whether they're at Sundance, or in Austin, Los Angeles or Honolulu. Cults are everywhere, Johnston states. ”I guarantee you there's a cult right here in your town.”  The toll the Buddhafield took can be counted in years lost, relationships abandoned, opportunities missed.  ”My 20s? Gone!” says Johnston, who was known as ”Ricky” and was said to be one of the guru's favorites. ”My 30s    gone!”  ”My 40s    gone!” So rues another follower, Vera Chieffo. ”My 50s    gone!” Radhia Gleis picks up the count. An accomplished equestrienne, she gave up her career to follow the guru and eventually rose to become one of his top aides. She regrets not having children. In trying to find enlightenment, they lost themselves and the best years of their lives.  Welcome to the 'Bootyfield'  Sitting through two showings of ”Holy Hell,” it's easy to understand how anyone could be seduced into joining the Buddhafield. Many followers come from privileged backgrounds, which leads me to wonder whether the search for enlightenment is a   phenomenon. Are people who work three jobs to make ends meet too busy to worry about their inner selves?  Many in the group seemed to have lapsed from the faith I was born into, Catholicism. A handful of others are former Bible Belt Protestants. With its positive message and promise of unconditional, universal love, the Buddhafield holds a special appeal to people seeking an alternative to all that guilt and fire and brimstone.  These people are not flakes    far from it. Many graduated from good colleges and were looking ahead to promising careers. They just had big questions. They wondered why they were here. What was the point? Were they missing something?  Their adventure looked like great fun    at first. What     hasn't thought about sharing space with a group of other attractive,   people? It's like running away to join the circus.  ”There was this really hot guy. . ..” That's all it took to hook Alessandra Burenin, who came to the festival from Austin, where she now sells real estate. The line always draws a laugh from film festival audiences. ”The spiritual stuff came later,” she says.   Despite the guru's admonitions against wasting cosmic energy on sex, former members say the Buddhafield soon turned into what one jokingly called ”the Bootyfield.”  Allen takes full advantage of his 22 years of footage to show the upside of Buddhafield life. The group dynamic was so good that it was easy to overlook the guru's eccentricities at first. So what if he uses a little too much guyliner? So what if a follower carries his portable chair around like a throne? So what if attendants called ”bodyworkers” serve at his beck and call, providing    massages? So what if he's dabbling so much with plastic surgery that he's starting to look a little scary. People in the Buddhafield didn't live in walled compounds or cut themselves off from the outside world. They rented houses and apartments, which they shared with other members in their circle of friends. And they had day jobs. But there were no children, and no pets. Women who got pregnant, according to former followers, were told to have abortions because the teacher instructs them that children and personal enlightenment didn't mix.  By 2006, when holy hell finally broke loose inside the group, the Buddhafield's intricate   of interpersonal relationships sustained some followers even as they abandoned their master. But the breakup was messy. Just like the breakup of a real family.  An email leads to 'the Big Ugly' The end of the Buddhafield as Allen and the others knew it began with an email. The group had been in Austin about a decade when a member announced he was done for good. And he was letting everybody know why: the pervasive psychological and sexual abuse he'd witnessed.  He accused the guru of using hypnotherapy techniques to plant suggestions during the $50 weekly ”cleansing sessions” all members of the Buddhafield underwent. And he accused him of improper sexual relationships with some of his closest male followers.  ”He used the sex with his disciples as a spiritual gift, spiritual growth, and a path to further enlightenment,” said the email, which Allen showed me. ”He manipulated people to feel that if they didn't take this sexual step, they weren't devoted to God and his work. His ability to control people's psyches was unsurpassed,” the email continued. Followers began to talk among themselves, and that's when Allen, Goldstein and Johnston say they first learned that their leader had been manipulating all of them for years. It would take just awhile longer for each of them to see it as sexual abuse.  ”He has, in fact, broken my heart,” the  's email continued. ”I loved him as much or more than many of you. I was close to him. .. very close. When I returned to the Buddhafield 3 years ago it was very apparent to me that things had changed radically.” The master's message no longer was about connecting with God. It was all about the master. ”The songs ceased to be about God anymore, and were all about master. The events,   movies, ballets, as well as the vibrations inside of us, were no longer about God . .. they were about master. Instead of 'connecting to God's love,' it was 'connect to my love'. ..  This says it all.” Johnston left the group in Austin. Allen held on a little while longer, working to relocate Andreas to Hawaii with the idea that he'd no longer hold himself out as a master or seek out followers.  The Buddhafield broke into warring factions    ”the Big Ugly,” they called the breakup    and eventually dissolved. The house was sold, and Gleis got her money back.  But Gleis was done, too. In the movie, she looks into Allen's eyes and angry tears well in her eyes. She says that though she knew him for 25 years, she had no idea about the dark secrets he'd been keeping. If she had, she says, she would have done something about it much sooner. She weeps as she describes how it felt to be demonized and ostracized by people she'd known for decades.   The box, ”Did you tell her about the box, Will?” Gleis is insistent that I hear about the box as we weave through a throng of tourist traffic. We're on our way to the Duke Hotel, one of the island's oldest and most elegant, for a round of fancy umbrella drinks. Yes, former members of the Buddhafield drink. And eat. And sing karaoke.  The mood turns somber as this Peter Pan of a tour guide speaks of his own abuse. For him, it was utterly degrading.  ”I would have to get ready for sex with him. You guys were all at satsang, singing,” Allen says, referring to one of the group's regular  spiritual gatherings. ”I would come over, and he would do his ritual with me,” he says. ”He was sitting in a chair, and I was kneeling in front of him. There was no intimacy there was no real love. People say we were in some sort of relationship? There was no relationship.” The guru would pleasure himself to pornography, he says, and then ”I would come in and be the finishing person.”  He recalls the next part of his story slowly, as if reliving the pain as he speaks. ”He'd go, 'OK, it's time to go get the box,' ” Allen says. ”He was a short man, and I'm a tall man. So, he'd be, 'Go get the box!' ”  Allen says he would try to distract himself.  ”As he was doing it to me, I'd just go, 'It's almost over. It's almost over.' And as soon as it was over, I'd go, 'OK, you don't have to think about this for a whole other week.' And so, for the next few days everything would be great. I'd have my community. We'd never talk about it. And then it would be Tuesday again, and I'd get nervous. And Wednesday I'd be, 'Oh my God, tomorrow's the night.' And Thursday I'd be panicking. But then I'd go, 'I made it, I don't have to worry about it for another week.' And that went on for 4½ years.”   ”I didn't register it as abuse,” he explains. ”I just thought, 'It's my problem. Why am I not surrendered?' I just didn't ever know what was happening to me. And then I had to love him like he was my guru. I had to honor and respect him as my guru, and that's when I started hating him. I was PTSD without even knowing it.” ”So romantic,” he adds, sarcasm dripping from his voice.  A day at the beach, I am amazed at how free of anger and bitterness Allen and his friends are. Whatever resentment and ill will they once felt seem to have vanished. Though their experiences might have been dark, there is a unique lightness about each of them. They are happy. Not everything about their Buddhafield experience was negative.  It's as though they've grabbed hold of some sort of fountain of youth. As Gleis says, ”I think we held up pretty well.”  Something takes hold of these former cult members when they are together. They even speak differently. Allen, for example, stops rushing about long enough to look me in the eye. ”I'm communicating with you,” he blurts out.  Since when were you not?  At other times, when they are all speaking at once, I find myself waiting for someone to referee they're like children who don't know how to wait their turn. At different times I want to pass each one of them the ”talking pillow.”  We're still waiting to hear back from the guru, although the prospects of actually meeting him grow dimmer by the minute as my departure time nears. So I decide to follow the group as they set out on some good,   island fun,  .  I've noticed over the weekend how these Buddhafield friends share an easy, deep connection. It reminds me of a reunion of college roommates or members of a championship team. Or maybe my first newspaper, since journalism is the cult I chose to squander my youth on.  The Buddhafield experience is so totally ”The Big Chill,” and who doesn't want some of that? I want to know more about this Peter Pan lifestyle and these people who feel free to climb mountains and dive into volcanic mud pits and bodysurf the big waves    because they feel like it. I want to know what the next adventure will be.  A plan is hatched to find a beach, the kind where waves curl over a long strip of sand. We set out, packing an SUV and a Prius full of   children. We push past Diamond Head, toward the windward side of the island, finally settling on Sandy Beach, which is crowded with surfers and boogie boarders.  The talk in the car is easy, even if I don't have much to contribute to conversations that begin with, ”Remember when we had that   with. . ..” (Allen says he wasn't there.)  Storm clouds are building, and the ocean is blue and green and white, but the waves are powerful, breaking forcefully right on top of the sand. Eventually, I catch one, perfectly. I feel my body drop from the top of the wave, sliding along the glassy inner curve. Then comes the white explosion, and I fully expect to be ground into the sand. But, kowabunga! I am pushed out ahead of the roiling foam and ride into shore.  Once again, I am 10 years old, and I've just caught the perfect wave. "
38537,57385,Zika found in mosquitoes in Miami Beach,CNN,,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,," (CNN) Mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus have been identified in Miami Beach, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said Thursday.  It's the first finding of   mosquitoes in the continental USA.  The three mosquito samples that tested positive were from the area in Miami Beach that was previously identified as an area of local transmission.  ”This is disappointing but not surprising,” said Adam Putnam, the Florida commissioner of agriculture.    measures and mosquito trapping are already in place in the area.  ”We already knew because of human cases [that] Zika transmission was occurring positive pools are just further indication that transmission is still occurring in the area,” CDC spokeswoman Candice Hoffmann said.  It was unclear when those mosquitoes were caught, although spraying has been ongoing throughout the area.  One of the mosquito traps with   mosquitoes was in the botanical gardens, according to   County Mayor Carlos Gimenez. The location of the other two traps where infected mosquitoes were caught was not disclosed. Sixteen other mosquito traps in   tested negative, Gimenez said, adding that tests on additional mosquitoes are underway.  Gimenez emphasized that the finding of these mosquitoes will not change current efforts to fight the virus and the mosquitoes that carry it. ”The message remains the same: If you have standing water, drain it, cover it please wear adequate clothing wear repellant,” he said.  Dr. Chris Braden, director of the division of foodborne, waterborne and environmental diseases at the CDC's National Center for Emerging Zoonotic and Infectious Diseases, said the finding helps inform and focus   measures. On August 11, the CDC warned pregnant women to avoid a    area of Miami Beach after the state confirmed local transmission of the virus there.  On July 29, Scott announced that the first local transmission of the virus in the continental USA had occurred in the Wynwood neighborhood, north of downtown Miami.  Aggressive   measures were begun, including mosquito spraying in the area. At the time, CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said that finding a   mosquito is like finding a needle in a haystack, and doing so is not necessary to confirm local mosquito transmission. To date, there have been 49 locally transmitted cases of the virus in Florida, according to the state Department of Health.   of those have been in   County. Florida is the only state in the continental USA where local transmission has occurred.  "
38562,57410,From a life sentence to clemency from Obama,CNN,Wesley Bruer,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,", Sharanda Jones says she was never told she could be facing life in prison after being indicted for seven counts of conspiracy to traffic cocaine. It was her first criminal offense. During her   trial, prosecutors were unable to produce any physical evidence that Jones actually ever possessed, bought, or sold cocaine and according to courtroom testimony, relied mostly on the word of admitted drug dealers and users who received leniency in exchange for their testimony. When the judge read the verdicts    ”not guilty” for six counts and ”guilty” of one    Jones felt somewhat relieved. That feeling wouldn't last very long.  As she listened to prosecutors tallying up the factors that determined jail time in federal court, Jones realized that she would be spending much more than the five or so years she expected in a worst case scenario.  The 23. 92 kilos of crack cocaine Jones was convicted of conspiring to traffic would have yielded a maximum sentence of just around 24 years' imprisonment based on federal sentencing guidelines. But prosecutors then began to argue for sentencing enhancements. A concealed carry permit in her name was used as evidence that a firearm was present ”in furtherance of a drug conspiracy.” She was listed as a ” ” of the conspiracy. And she committed perjury, they said, according to court documents, ”for her false denials of guilt on the stand.”  Prosecutors argued that due to the amount of time she was facing, Jones should be held until sentencing. The judge agreed.  ”My attorney told me, 'Don't say anything,' that [he'll] do all the talking and just stand there. And I see marshals coming and I didn't know what that meant, not knowing they were coming to lock me up,” Jones said.  Jones was immediately taken into custody after her guilty verdict, which was a shock in itself considering it was her first encounter with the criminal justice system. That morning she had dropped her daughter off at school, gone to work at the diner she   and attended her hearing during her lunch break. Jones recalls that she even left her purse in her car that day, thinking she would have time to sort her affairs well before beginning to serve out her punishment.  Jones was sentenced in November 1999 to mandatory life in prison without the possibility of parole. She would never again drop her daughter off at school, work another shift in her diner, or drive the car unintentionally abandoned in the Dallas courthouse parking lot. ”I remember him saying 'I'm sentencing you to life' and I was just numb,” Jones said. ”I couldn't understand it. I was just blank. My body was numb. I couldn't cry. I couldn't process it at all.”  Sharanda wasn't the only member of her family headed to jail for this conspiracy case. Her sister Sherena served six years for what prosecutors portrayed as a minor role in the conspiracy. Her brother Ernest was sentenced to 18 years in prison. And her mother, a quadriplegic since a car accident at the age of 20, was sentenced to a 17 years.  The Case, The Jones family were just four of more than 100 black residents of Terrell, Texas, rounded up in a drug sweep aimed at crack cocaine users, dealers, and suppliers in 1997. Over the following two years, the Kaufman County Sheriff Department, Terrell, Texas police detectives, and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents would leverage those arrested for   offenses into giving up information on fellow users, dealers, and suppliers. With many defendants facing long ”mandatory minimum” sentences for   drug offenses, government informants were not hard to come by    friends and neighbors testified against one another to downplay their involvement in the conspiracy. Those that testified or ”snitched” received leniency in their sentences. Those that didn't faced the harshest punishment. Drug users and low level drug dealers receiving jail terms reserved for the most notorious kingpins, Jones says.  Sharanda's decision not to snitch would prove costly.  ”They arrested a couple I knew, a couple I had dealt with in the past and they implicated me.” Jones explained. ”Not as their main supplier but as someone who could just help them out.” The couple, Julie Franklin and Keith Jackson, acquaintances of the Jones family, had called Sharanda pleading for her to front them drugs to be sold later as they were hard pressed for money. Unbeknownst to Jones, their conversation was being recorded and listened to by the DEA. At first, Jones reluctantly agreed to try to connect them with a woman who may be able to provide them with drugs to sell, but ultimately told them she was back running the diner and that any drug contacts she had known are ”long gone, all gone,” according to court documents.   That couple later testified that Jones had previously provided them with 40 kilograms of powder cocaine to be converted to crack. Additionally, a Houston cocaine supplier, Joseph Antoine testified that he provided Jones with cocaine to be sold at the family ”crack house” that Jones and her siblings and mother were alleged to be dealing from, accusing Jones herself of setting the market price for crack cocaine in the area.  ”Evidence of Sharanda Jones's involvement in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine at 705 Rosehill is sufficient, though only barely so,” according to a ruling from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upholding her conviction.  ”They clearly testified that I was the middle person because they actually got the main character and they got the low level drug dealers and they put me in the middle of both of them,” Jones said.  Julie Franklin and Keith Jackson would be later sentenced to seven and eight years with Antoine, the main supplier, receiving     years. All have since been released.  Doing Time, On November 10, 1999 BOP Prisoner No.   began her life sentence at a Tallahassee, Florida federal prison before being transferred a year later to Carswell federal prison in Forth Worth, Texas alongside her mother, who was on the medical floor that she described as a ”nursing home type setting,” and her sister, Sherena, who she shared a unit with.  ”Those are    rooms and there are four people in those rooms,” Sharanda recalled. ”That's harsh living.”  Despite the severity of her sentence, Jones insists she never let it break her. ”All the staff can tell you I never programmed my mind to say life. And people would ask me how much time I had. I just could never get life out. It just didn't seem right rolling off my tongue,” Jones said. ”I just knew an appeal will work. Maybe I'll do five, ten, 15 years at the most because I am guilty. But not for no life sentence.”  Nonetheless, Jones settled in for a long stint. ”You can be in any group in prison. They have a wild group, they have a calm group, they have older people. So, I kind of like stick with my group the older people, watch the news daily and that's how I kept up with what was going on in the world,” Jones said.  The remote possibility of freedom in the future, no matter how distant, kept Jones far away from all the trouble or temptations a prisoner may face in trying to escape from their realities. ”The pill line is the number one thing there. Just drugs, drugs, drugs. I had to get two knee replacements and all they could offer me is Percocets and OxyContin. I always turned down narcotics. Friends before had already told me, 'Don't take a narcotic, we took them when we came here and now we are addicted to those drugs',” Jones said.  Jones wasn't a perfect prisoner, she admits, having to occasionally sneak pass a particularly strict guard who refused to let Jones into the medical ward to see her mother.  ”We based the rest of our lives around helping our mom,” Jones said.  But no matter how much family she had around her to ease the pain of being incarcerated, she could not wrap her mind around how unfair her sentence seemed. ”We had rapists, murderers. The prison I was at had a max unit where people have done horrible crimes and they still had a number, they still had a [release] date. And I would compare myself to those people cause my cell was facing the max unit. when they take people in and out I'm looking at that. I'm looking at how they chained and shackled up and I'm chained and shackled up and I'm like, this just don't match up to me,” Sharanda recalled with cracks in her voice.  In 2009, Jones received an unexpected visit in prison from a stranger that would change her life. Brittany Byrd was still a law student when she stumbled upon Jones' case and began to research it. The daughter of an incarcerated mother, Byrd was moved to action. Soon, Byrd visited Jones, who at the time had no legal representation as all her appeals had been exhausted, and convinced her that she would take the case all the way to the White House if she had to, until Jones was a free woman.  ”I was like, you know, God you really sending someone to help me and from that day on, our vibes grew stronger and our belief grew together like this is gonna happen one day so we started working on the clemency,” Jones said, describing how it felt to meet Byrd. But it wasn't until her mother died, one year away from her release, that Sharanda really set her mind on freedom. Jones recalls the last exchange she had with her mother. ”She said I gotta go out to the hospital and said 'I'll see you tomorrow'. The next day they called and said she had 24 hours to live and I didn't understand that. That was like all I knew at Carswell was to be with her,” Jones said, crying. ”As soon as my mother passed I said I knew I'm going home. I scheduled my routine around her so, that's all I knew.”  Getting Out, To date, Obama has granted 673 commutations, with 232 of those individuals initially serving life sentences. According to Neil Eggleston, White House counsel to the President, these individuals ”received unduly harsh sentences under outdated laws for committing largely nonviolent drug crimes.”  And while recent drug sentencing reforms, such as former Attorney General Holder's ”Smart on Crime Initiative,” which prioritizes federal prosecutor resources for the most serious offenses, keep many low level offenders from entering the overcrowded prison system, there was no retroactive mechanism to assist those already convicted.  The only possibility of freedom, they determined, would be a presidential pardon or commutation. Byrd would have to live up to the promise she made and get the Obama administration to pay attention to Sharanda's case. With the clemency petition filed, Byrd began a grassroots campaign to highlight what she saw as a major injustice in Jones' sentence.  One Monday in December 2015, Byrd heard rumors that Obama was scheduled to announce a round of pardons, commutations, and clemencies. ”Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, nothing happened,” Sharanda remembers. ”Then on Friday, the officer called me and told me to go to the back conference room and that just doesn't happen.”  Jones waited alongside another inmate, both uncertain as to why they were being called in but remaining hopeful that their long shot bids for freedom had finally been granted. They began praying together before Jones was then escorted into yet another conference room where a phone call was waiting on her. It was Byrd, her attorney.  ”Brittany, is everything ok?” Jones asked.  ”You're going home!” Byrd screamed as Jones broke down in tears. But just as Jones had to adapt to prison life almost 17 years ago, she now must adapt to life on the outside and reconcile all the moments she's missed with her family. Since being released, Jones has found a job doing clerical work and is trying to rebuild her life while reconnecting with her daughter, Clenesha, who had been without her mother since the age of 8. And while Jones may have missed out on raising her own daughter, she feels she has been blessed with yet another second chance with the birth of her granddaughter three months ago.   Jones plans to use her voice to raise awareness for the need for criminal justice reform. ”I am so grateful for having a second chance at life but I left so many women behind who deserve the same mercy I was given,” Jones said. ”I want to be done but I can't be done until more come home.” CORRECTION: A previous version of this story contained a photo caption that misspelled Reynolds Wintersmith's name."
38570,57418,Refugees welcome: Sharing your home with a stranger,CNN,,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,," (CNN) When hundreds of thousands of refugees began arriving in Berlin last summer, Manuela and Joerg Buisset abandoned plans to rent out their   basement, and instead offered it to refugees in need of shelter. Ahmed and Nourhan and their daughter Alin came to stay for 10 days, carrying all of their belongings in two small plastic bags. More than a year later, they and their new baby are now part of the Buisset family    though it hasn't all been easy. ”Ahmed was very insecure and shy, but we thought he was stubborn,” recalls Manuela. ”He wouldn't make eye contact with us, which we thought was so impolite, but he thought it was rude to make eye contact . .. He later told me he was just completely lost.” ”We are so happy here,” says Nourhan. Manuela went with Nourhan to all her medical appointments, and was at the hospital when baby Laith was born in July. ”At first I was scared,” admits Manuela, ”But we really, really like each other now.” Although they feel at home with the Buissets, the family longs to return to Al Quneitra in Syria    when peace talks were held last November, they began packing their bags in the hope they could go back. 'We packed whatever we could and ran' Architect Lars Asklund was so moved by the sight of thousands of refugees arriving in Sweden that he went to an immigration camp in his hometown of Malmo to try to help. While there, he met Waleed Lababdi. ”I asked him three questions: 'Are you married?' He said yes. 'Do you have kids?' He said no. I looked him straight in the eye and asked: 'Are you a fundamentalist?' He said no. I told him 'OK, I have a good proposal for you. '” Lababdi and his wife Farah Hilal moved in with Asklund in November 2015 Farah's brother Milad Hilal joined them last Christmas.  The trio had fled their home in Syria in 2012, first moving from place to place within the country and then, when a missile landed across the street, leaving the country for good. Now they have a new home with Asklund the four eat breakfast together every day, and gather for Swedish lessons at the kitchen table each week. ”He cares so much,” says Milad. ”He studies with me, even when he comes late at night. We are so lucky to have met him.” Asklund says he too has benefited from the arrangement: ”For me it's fun. It's fantastic, I have new friends and I really like them.” 'Integration is not   work' The Jellinek family is used to welcoming guests into their Berlin home for the weekly   Shabbat dinner, but now they have a regular    and somewhat unlikely    participant: Syrian Muslim Kinan. ”It's wonderful, because every Shabbat we meet new people,” says    Joshy. ”Kinan brings his friends and friends of our family come too.” Kinan, 28, from Damascus, has lived with the Jellineks since November 2015, and now feels at home enough to cook Syrian meals for the family.  ”We are both minorities in this country,” says Chaim. ”One thing we have in common is that our identities are very different from the majority in this society. ”Integration is not   work,” he says. ”[It] is not something that we should only ask from people coming into our country, we should ask this of ourselves too. We must accept different food, different culture, behavior.” 'To be completely helpless, that was the hardest thing' Wilhelm and Brian met Syrian refugee Inas on a train shortly after he arrived in Germany they struck up a conversation with the help of Google Translate, and swapped phone numbers at the end of their journey. Inas, who was staying in an emergency shelter, reached out to them for help and advice, and asked if he could use them as a local contact when filling in paperwork. His first   permit to stay in Germany listed Brian and Wilhelm's home as his legal address. ”It came as quite a surprise to us of course,” says Brian. ”At first we were completely unsure of all the implications, three months is a long time. But we talked with our friends and decided: let's do it!” The couple, who have been together for 25 years and married in 2011, were concerned about how he would react to their relationship. ”We knew we had to tell him we were gay,” Wilhelm says. ”So we showed him our wedding pictures. He shook our hands and said, 'No problem. '” Fashion designer Inas, who is originally from Damascus, had to leave behind his thriving wedding dress company when he left Syria, carrying just a few bags. He initially struggled in Berlin. ”Suddenly I was not a grown up man with a life anymore,” he says. ”I felt like a child. Brian and Wilhelm helped me with everything . .. To be completely helpless, that was the hardest thing.” Now he feels at home in the city, where he hopes to stay for good, and is working with a haute couture dressmaker. 'They gave me life again' Devout Muslim Ahmed and his teenage children Ali and Hiba were housed in a church when they first arrived in Malmo, Sweden after fleeing the civil war in Syria. ”They received us with so much love, compassion and care,” says Ahmed. ”They were angels.” Gabriella and Candel met the family while volunteering for charity Refugees Welcome they offered Ahmed a room in their house    but weren't sure how he'd react to their relationship. ”We told him we are married. He was very nice and polite but it all got very quiet,” recalls Gabriella. ”We thought he might change his mind.” The    was shocked, but says he is hugely grateful to them for taking his family in: ”I see how kind they are, I see their humanity, their love and kindness. They gave me life again.” Candel says she and Gabriella enjoy sharing their home, and that the arrangement is mutually beneficial: ”We get an extended family, we get to know about a new language, great food, and culture and they get a fast track into society.” 'We are all refugees' Berliners Claudia and Tobias grew up in the former East Germany, escaping to the West in the 1980s, and know only too well what it means to flee your home: ”At the end of the day, we are all refugees,” says Claudia. They became friends with Newruz, from Homs in Syria, when he was living in a refugee center in Meissen, Tobias's hometown, but had to wait nine months before he got his papers and was able to move to Berlin to stay with them. ”This arrangement means we are equals,” says Claudia. ”Sometimes I catch myself mothering him a little, because we have children that are his age, but we are really more like flatmates.” ”When we first told my father that Newruz would move in with us he smiled and his eyes sparkled,” Tobias says. ”I wasn't expecting such a positive reaction. He told us that . .. when he was a child, they had a refugee woman from Poland living with them for a while too. The only difference is that today they come from further afield.” Newruz, who is taking German lessons and hopes to train to be a nursery teacher, says Berlin feels like a home from home. ”Berlin and Homs are very similar,” he says. ”In terms of food, cycling around the streets . .. Meißen was very different, but Berlin is like my city and I have a few friends here now.” 'My neighbors have not been welcoming' Uta lives in Berlin's Marzahn district, she says her decision to take in Afghan refugee Hamid has not gone down well. ”My neighbours have not been the most welcoming,” she says, explaining that each time she adds Hamid's name to her mailbox, it has been removed, and that she has been told ”we don't want foreigners here.” Uta, who has two children of her own, is determined to make them change their minds. ”He's my son,” she told those who raised objections. ”You just have to get used to it.” But she says it has not come without a cost: ”I had to end friendships with people who didn't accept what I was doing. It was a shock to see how mean and   people can be.” Hamid goes to German classes and is working at an integration project where, he says: ”I really like to feel useful.” And for Uta, the arguments with neighbors have been worth it to have Hamid in her life: ”I've never learned so much in my life since having Hamid here, about religion, food, and other cultures.” 'Maybe we are setting a good example' Nawras Ahmadook's family took Valerie Schamberger into their home and looked after her when she was far from her native Austria, living in Aleppo, Syria to study Arabic. Ten years on, the Schambergers are returning the favor, welcoming Nawras, a former player on the Syrian national basketball team, to the small town of Bad Schallerbach. ”After everything I went through and everything I lost; my family, my friends, my country, my home, I really had nothing more to lose,” says Nawras. ”I was not afraid of getting on that dinghy boat and crossing the sea. Leaving Syria is not a choice.” When Valerie found out that Nawras had made it to Europe, she phoned her parents and asked them to help him. Her mother Martina drove to the border first thing the next morning. Now he's part of the family, Martina says. ”I feel like he is my son. He accepts me, a bit different than his mother, he opens up to me a lot, like a friend too.” ”People are looking at us closely,” she says. ”Maybe we are setting a good example.” 'It's magical. I can do what I like' Alqumit Alhamad fled his home in Raqqa, Syria, when ISIS took control. As a gay artist, he feared for his life: his friends were tortured by the militants, and homosexual men were thrown from buildings in the city. He traveled to Europe carrying a change of clothes, art supplies and his Lady Gaga, Bjork and Barbra Streisand CDs. ”Guards across Europe always looked at me weird when they searched my bag,” he says. ”But I don't care, I can't live without my music.” After arriving in Malmo, Sweden, in February this year, he met Linnea Tell, a single mother and librarian, who offered him a place to stay. ”I can't tell you how much my life changed and how free I feel,” he says. ”Every day I wake up and say 'Oh my God, I am in Sweden'. It's magical. I can say what I like, do what I like.  ”The people here, the support, the culture, the safety, it's a whole other world, especially for a gay person from the Arab world.” 'You have to take a stand somehow' Bilal Aljaber spent two years traveling from Syria to Germany, but by the time he got there, he wanted nothing more than to turn around and go home.  Then he met author and bookstore owner Edgar Rai and his wife Amelie. Rai jokes that it was ”love at first sight,” and after they got to know each other, the Rais offered Aljaber, 26, their spare room. ”They are like my second family,” Aljaber says. ”Anything they can help me with, they do it wholeheartedly. We have a very close friendship and this is one of the most beautiful things that has happened to me.  ”I feel I have someone here, someone supporting me, helping me,” he says. ”I am not all alone.” The Rai family has also taken Aljaber's brother Amr, 17, into their Berlin home. ”There is no way of pretending that this was not everybody's problem anymore,” Rai insists. ”You have to take a stand somehow.” 'He doesn't need us at all' Mouhanad Mourad fell in love with Vienna when he stopped for a much needed rest on his long journey from Damascus, Syria    via Libya    to Europe. After days on the road, he decided to stay and make the Austrian city his home. Determined to make it work, he helped in the kitchen of the refugee center, made friends and started learning German. Six months later, he moved out to live in a shared flat with Valerie Schamberger, Nora Katona and Roman Pable. And while his flatmates worried that he might need lots of help, they soon found out that Mouhanad, who founded his own support group, called Refugees for Refugees, was already settled. ”Mouhanad knows more people than we do,” says Valerie. ”His list of contacts is incredible and we didn't have to step in    he doesn't need us at all.”  ”He is standing on his own feet very well,” says Roman. ”We thought we might have to look after him like a younger brother but we didn't have to do anything. He's very orderly, very organized, a very German Syrian.” Changing lives    and minds, Nooria was abandoned by her husband when he found out she was pregnant. She says his decision to leave meant she could not stay in her hometown. ”A woman cannot live alone in Afghanistan and raise her own child without a man,” she says, explaining that she would have been forced to hand her daughter to her   . Nooria and Aysu, now two, fled the country and ended up in Austria, where they were introduced to mechanical engineer Sabine David. David and her husband Dominique offered the pair a place to stay in their picturesque hilltop home, close to the Slovenian border    despite the reservations of others. ”In the beginning, some people had concerns, telling us we cannot take in a stranger, that they will steal from us,” Sabine recalls. ”But then when they met Nooria they changed their minds. Now they say,'It's not the same with women and children. '” Nooria is busy finding her feet    and her independence    in her new home, where she is learning to ride a bike to get around. ”It makes me feel special,” she says. ”I am so happy with the bicycle and the freedom.” 'They are so full of surprises' Classmates Juan and Mohammed came to Germany from Damascus, Syria, in October 2015, following in the footsteps of Juan's brothers, Mzkin and Alan. Sabine Waldner and her twin daughters Charlotte and Miriam met the older pair while volunteering at a local refugee center, and offered Juan and Mohammed a place to stay. ”It's amazing how confident they have become since they've been here,” says Charlotte. ”They were so shy at the beginning. ”They are so full of surprises. We learn so much from each other and we enjoy ourselves. The other day, I taught Momo to ride a bicycle!” Juan and Mohammed have enrolled at the local high school, and since this photograph was taken, Charlotte and Miriam have moved out of the family home, allowing Mzkin and Alan to move in. 'I feel like I am living in heaven' When Margarethe Kramer offered a spare room in her home to a refugee, she was expecting a   woman with traditional views to move in.  ”But I was really surprised when I met Souad,” the kindergarten teacher says. ”She is so independent, so open minded, [so] modern.” Souad Awad, 49, a refugee from Iraq, has been living with Kramer in the Austrian border town of Lavanttal for just a few weeks, but already the pair are firm friends. ”I feel like I am living in heaven now,” Souad said. ”Margarethe is amazing    so sweet and her whole family is wonderful. I feel at home. I feel she's like my sister.” Kramer, 59, says she is pleased to have someone to keep her company while her husband is away working for much of the week. ”The whole experience enriched my life, with friendship and companionship,” she says."
38593,57441,2 American climbers missing on Pakistan mountain,CNN,Faith Karimi,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,," (CNN) Improved weather conditions will allow helicopters to join the search Saturday for two American climbers missing after an attempt to scale one of the highest peaks in northern Pakistan, a family spokesman for one of the missing men said.  Kyle Dempster and Scott Adamson, from Utah, set out early August 21 to climb the north face of Ogre 2, near the Choktoi Glacier, authorities said.  The two men have not been seen since August 22, the day before a storm hit the mountain, according to a GoFundMe page set up to raise funds for their rescue.  A weather window opening up Saturday    the first break in the weather in 10 days    will allow Pakistani military helicopters to join the search, Jonathan Thesenga, a family spokesperson for Dempster, said in a statement. ”We have been in communication with the Pakistan military and they assure us that two Pakistani military helicopters will be starting the search,” he said. ”We owe a huge amount of gratitude to the Pakistan government for scrambling all of their available assets and their commitment to finding Scott and Kyle.”   climb planned, The climbers' initial plan included five days for the climb and descent, the Alpine Club of Pakistan said in a statement.  ”When they did not return on the expected date, the base camp team informed us. We then started communication with all concerned local authorities and the climbers' families.” Dempster is from Salt Lake City, Utah, while Adamson lives in nearby Provo, Utah. The two friends tried to summit the treacherous north face of Ogre 2 last year but turned back after Adamson fell and broke his leg, according to CNN affiliate KUTV. ”It's a remote area in Pakistan, not like you see with teams of people in the Himalayas,” said Thesenga.   The   peak sees intense snowstorms and bad weather this time of the year, complicating search efforts.  The government had previously not dispatched a rescue helicopter because of weather conditions, local official Muhammad Iqbal said.  Ogre 2 is one of the steepest peaks in the region and was ascended only three times between 1977 and 2012, said Ayaz Shigri of the Baltistan Tour Operator Association. "
40523,59392,"North Korea sanctions: Futile, counterproductive and dangerous",CNN,John Delury,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Seoul (CNN) If you have a sense of deja vu reading headlines about new UN sanctions on North Korea as punishment for a nuclear test, that's because you literally have seen these headlines before    as recently as spring.  In March, after Pyongyang's fourth nuclear test, the UN Security Council promised that Resolution 2270 would be the   inflicting crippling economic pain that would force Kim Jong Un to change his calculus. Those spring sanctions were billed as ”the toughest yet.”  Spring, alas, turns into summer, and then fall.  Proponents of sanctions, or ”boa constrictors” as I affectionately call them, were sounding less triumphant by September, when Kim Jong Un flouted the UNSC by carrying out a fifth nuclear test    the largest to date. Even worse, trade statistics showed North Korea generating more revenue than ever in coal sales to China (buoyed up by rising coal prices). It looked the game had not really changed after all. Loopholes, Rather than step back and rethink the strategy for dealing with the North Korean quagmire, Washington plunged headlong into another round of lobbying Beijing and Moscow for yet more sanctions.  Over the last three months, the focus was on getting agreement to close the coal ”loophole” in the previous resolution, which had exempted trade related to people's ”livelihoods.” The centerpiece of the new resolution is that it imposes ”a hard, binding cap on (North Korea's) coal exports.” We are being promised these new sanctions will cut the flow of hard currency into Kim's coffers by $700 million.  Alas, the $700 million mark is a just a projection based on a   scenario that assumes perfect compliance with the coal cap. Lots of crossborder trade with China goes unreported in the first place, so we could simply see more of it going off the books. The resolution sets a total export volume, 7. 5 million tons, that North Korea is not allowed to exceed, but there is no enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance or punish  .  Sanctioned to fail, For the sake of argument, let's accept the   premise that North Korea makes $700 million less on coal exports next year, and is unable to make it up in other economic activity (another hidden assumption! ).  Well guess what    if Kim and his generals have to tighten their belts, the nuclear and missile programs are about the last things they will cut. On the contrary, in the absence of diplomatic talks and under intensified pressure, Pyongyang is likely to   on its nuclear deterrent, which it sees as its best guarantee of national security and regime survival.  It makes sense to slap Pyongyang on the wrist for flagrant violations of nuclear   treaties and norms. And it's prudent to enforce narrow sanctions targeting the nuclear and missile programs. However, the international community should no longer delude itself into thinking that economic punishment will force Kim Jong Un to cry uncle and give up his nuclear deterrent.  More sanctions designed to inflict greater pain on North Korea only steels Pyongyang's resolve to hold on tight to what it calls the ”treasured sword” of a nuclear arsenal.  That brings us to the final, sad irony in these years spent trying to ”tighten the noose” around Kim Jong Un's neck and build a wall around the North Korean economy. The sanctions effort is not only futile, it's counterproductive and dangerous.  ”Comprehensive” sanctions send North Korea deeper into isolation and increase the risks of a war that no one wants, a war that could be truly catastrophic. Another path, We should be moving into the exact opposite direction. The only solution to the North Korean dilemma is a   strategy to draw the regime and North Korean people out of their isolation. It will take decades, and starts with sitting down at the table with Kim Jong Un, and helping him open up and develop his economy.  We will have to put up with North Korea's de facto nuclear status for some time. That said, there are things we can get through negotiation to freeze their program, restore monitoring, and reduce risks of a conflict that escalates beyond control.  Right now, South Korean foreign policy is paralyzed by the public's demand that President Park   step down. Park has turned into a hardliner on North Korea, and looking ahead, the leading candidates to replace her support a strategy of engaging Pyongyang. Trump has sent mixed signals about how he will handle North Korea, but during the campaign he did boldly express a willingness to talk with Kim Jong Un. Beijing, no matter how annoyed by its neighbor, consistently maintains the view that talks and trade are the solution to the North Korean conundrum.  They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn. Perhaps, after today's promises of ” ” sanctions give way once more to disappointment with their effects, the cycle will be broken, and a new strategy can be pursued. "
40524,59393,China's NextEV faster than Tesla?,CNN,John McIlroy,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,," (CNN) It's not often that a   can claim to be a   from the off. But that's precisely what's happening in the auto industry, where Chinese unknown NextEV has launched what it claims is the world's fastest electric car. John McIlroy is Deputy Editor of Auto Express and Carbuyer.   cars have been around for decades but only in the past five years or so have the mainstream manufacturers really started to take them seriously    prompted by tightening rules over when and where conventionally powered vehicles can be driven, and battery technology that has made them more usable in the real world. As such, there have already been a few upstarts, most notably Elon Musk's Tesla, which confounded the giant car brands by launching precisely the vehicle they said was impossible at the time: a luxury executive saloon with a range of more than 200 miles. Truth be told, Tesla's offering will still   NextEV's NIO EP9 up to a point. But the NIO EP9's pace has been judged over more than just a   drag race this   (1, 341bhp) creation has, in fact, proven its mettle around the famed Nurburgring in Germany, a 12.  monster of a race circuit known simply as 'The Green Hell.' Breaking records, The 195mph NIO EP9 has lapped the track, NextEV claims, in just 7m 05. 12sec, or around 17 seconds faster than the previous electric car record. Indeed, to put it in context, the EP9's time is only beaten in the   list by four   cars, two of them thinly disguised racers, and the other two supercars from Porsche and Lamborghini.  And yet the EP9 can be recharged from flat in as little as 45 minutes, to offer a range of more than 265 miles. There is no guarantee that it will deliver this in production, but if it does, it has the potential to rewrite the rules of the hypercar market. NextEV has committed so far to six examples, all reserved for the company's initial investors. But, even with each EP9 costing around $1. 2 million to build, the firm may consider an additional small production run, if only to raise its global profile further. China is a hotbed of EV activity because crippling pollution in many cities has persuaded Beijing to open up that side of the business to ' ' companies. Some, like NextEV and telecoms   EV developer LeEco, appear to have enough backing to not only deliver a car, but to reach global customers. China's growing electric vehicle market, They are not alone in sharing that ambition. Earlier this year, the   Beijing Auto International Corporation launched an EV   called ArcFox with a creation called the  . It has a 603bhp electric motor, is made mostly out of carbon fiber and can reach 60mph in less than three seconds    though its top speed is more modest than the EP9's, at 155mph. Its range is more limited too, at 186 miles. Another brand, TechRules, has been testing an innovative hybrid supercar around the UK's F1 GP venue, Silverstone.  The car carries the unusual moniker TREV, which actually stands for   Electric Vehicle, and it mixes plenty of   tech    including carbon fiber construction, a small   battery pack and   drive    to deliver a theoretical top speed of more than 217mph, while potentially running for more than 1, 242 miles between  .  Even the choice of fuel is open to interpretation one version of the car, called AT96, can run on aviation fuel, diesel or petrol, while the other, called GT96, is powered by natural gas. Read: Inside China's largest ghost town, Qiantu Motor's K50, another 2016 debutant, sits just below supercar territory, but even so, its mix of aluminum and carbon fiber construction, and   drive through a pair of electric motors, brings performance that will match many European creations    a top speed of 125mph and, more importantly,   in less than five seconds. Luxury car manufactures enter market, Still, the Chinese are not likely to have the 'electric hypercar' space to themselves for very long. Desperate not to be beaten to the punch, the established car brands are now clamoring to get their own   offerings to market.  The giant VW Group is   development of electric components and already showcased one of the first cars that will use them    the Porsche Mission E. It's a   electric saloon, but its performance will rival that of many sports cars and it should introduce new standards for   too. Read: Why China's   are buying up   homes, Even the supercar elite who normally exist above the general industry are not immune to the demand for greater environmental credentials in their cars.  The fastest vehicles recently offered by Ferrari and McLaren have both featured electrification, and the British company has already admitted it is working on an   supercar.  Interestingly, though, these are names with history, so they have a reputation to protect    whereas NextEV and its like have hundreds of millions of dollars of investment and, at the same time, nothing to lose. Read: Is this where China's billionaires stash their investments?  Winning over customers is about more than numbers, though. And this, in fact, may ultimately prove a bigger test for NextEV, TechRules and ArcFox than the technical challenge of getting around the Nurburgring (or, for that matter, actually bringing their cars to market at all).  In the past, buyers with the wherewithal to spend more than a million dollars on a car have been more drawn towards those brands with heritage. The Chinese brands must hope that the same does not apply to those who want not just an exclusive supercar, but also one that they can plug into the wall every evening."
40525,59394,Ellison defends comments about Middle East,CNN,Daniella Diaz,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Washington (CNN) Rep. Keith Ellison, a leading contender to be the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee, wrote an open letter to the   League over past comments he made about American policy in the Middle East that the group says are ”disqualifying.” The first Muslim elected to Congress responded to a statement issued by ADL's CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, who this week in a statement condemned a 2010 Ellison speech implying US policy in the region favored Israel at the expense of   countries    ”that U. S. foreign policy is based on religiously or national   special interests rather than simply on America's best interests.” ”In a speech recorded in 2010 to a group of supporters, Rep. Ellison is heard suggesting that American foreign policy in the Middle East is driven by Israel, saying: 'The USA foreign policy in the Middle East is governed by what is good or bad through a country of 7 million people. A region of 350 million all turns on a country of 7 million. Does that make sense? Is that logic? Right? When the Americans who trace their roots back to those 350 million get involved, everything changes,'” the statement read.  Greenblatt continued, ”Rep. Ellison's remarks are both deeply disturbing and disqualifying.” Rep. Keith Ellison faces renewed scrutiny over past ties to Nation of Islam, defense of   figures, In Ellison's open letter to the ADL, he said his 2010 comments were ”selectively edited and taken out of context by an individual the Southern Poverty Law Center has called an '  extremist. '” ”I wish we could have spoken once again before your most recent statement. If given the opportunity, I could have provided a full and proper explanation,” Ellison wrote in the letter. ”My memory is that I was responding to a question about how Americans with roots in the Middle East could engage in the political process in a more effective way. My advice was simply to get involved. I believe that Israel and the U. S.  relationship are, and should be, key considerations in shaping U. S. policy in the Middle East.”  Ellison, who said he was ”saddened” by the ADL statement, added that he wanted to meet soon with Greenblatt ”to discuss our shared beliefs and commitment to fairness and justice,” and said he was ”committed to building a strong relationship with you.”  Ellison added that he thought the comments were being surfaced by unnamed ”  interests to drive a wedge between   allies in the fight for equal rights.” ”My record proves my deep and   support for Israel, and I have always fought   racism, sexism, and homophobia   the same values embodied by the   League.” Ellison is also facing criticism for past ties to the Nation of Islam and his defense of its   leader, Louis Farrakhan    which are resurfacing as he campaigns to lead the DNC. CNN's KFile reviewed Ellison's past writings and public statements during the late 1980s through the 1990s, which revealed his   involvement in the Nation of Islam. However, none of the records reviewed found examples of Ellison making any   comments himself, and Ellison disavowed his early comments in 2006 after it became an issue during his run for Congress. In his 2006 comments, Ellison wrote he had seen the Nation of Islam and the Million Man March as positive efforts to promote responsibility and economic development in the black community    but added that he had failed to scrutinize the views of Farrakhan and Khalid Abdul Muhammad and wrongly dismissed concerns they were  . The American Jewish World endorsed Ellison in 2006, saying they were ”convinced that Ellison has had a real change of heart and mind.” And speaking to a synagogue in 2006, Ellison said he was confronting a past he wasn't proud of. ”I wasn't proud of my work with the Nation of Islam,” Ellison said at the time, ”but I was hoping it wouldn't come up. I have come face to face with my past.”"
40526,59395,UN apologizes for Haiti cholera spread,CNN,Emanuella Grinberg,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,," (CNN) The United Nations did not do enough to prevent the spread of cholera epidemic in Haiti that killed at least 10, 000 people after the 2010 earthquake,   Ban   said Thursday in his first formal apology for the outbreak. To many, the apology was long overdue. The UN denied claims that Nepalese peacekeepers brought cholera to the island nine months after the devastating earthquake, the first known appearance of the disease there in over 150 years. Scientists, victims' families and advocacy groups accused peacekeepers of spreading cholera through improper sanitation disposal at their base near a river.  With a month left in his term, Ban issued the carefully worded apology as part of an announcement of a new plan to eradicate the disease.  ”On behalf of the United Nations, I want to say very clearly: We apologize to the Haitian people,” Ban told the UN General Assembly. ”We simply did not do enough with regard to the cholera outbreak and its spread in Haiti.  As he spoke the apology in French, Creole and English, he acknowledged both the outbreak's human toll and its damage to the UN's standing in Haiti and beyond. ”This has cast a shadow upon the relationship between the United Nations and the people of Haiti. It is a blemish on the reputation of UN peacekeeping and the Organization worldwide.”  For many, though, the apology was too little, too late, focused on the UN's response and stopping short of accepting full responsibility.  And, it remains to be seen whether members states will pledge sufficient financial support in the form of what Ban called ”voluntary contributions.” ”For the sake of the Haitian people, but also for the sake of the United Nations itself, we have a moral responsibility to act.  And we have a collective responsibility to deliver,” he said. 'We cannot turn away' Cholera is an acute gastrointestinal illness caused by ingesting food or drink contaminated with Vibrio cholerae bacteria. It can cause severe diarrhea and vomiting, which leads to extreme dehydration. Patients who are not treated quickly to restore lost fluids can die within hours.  The outbreak hampered efforts to rebuild Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake, and Hurricane Matthew this year only worsened matters. The World Health Organization sent 1 million cholera vaccine doses to Haiti in October amid concerns over the rising number of cases in the hurricane's aftermath. It also did extensive damage to the UN's standing as criticism mounted over its failure to contain the initial outbreak. Ban's denial of responsibility further undermined the organization's credibility, special investigators said this year. Haitian cholera victims watched a live webstream of the briefing, clapping and cheering as Ban apologized, according to   Institute for Justice  Democracy In Haiti. They welcomed the apology, but said actions were necessary to complement his words. ”This was a victory for us today. It wasn't easy. We sent thousands of letters and were in the street to get this victory for them to say today that they were responsible. They said that and we thank them,” said cholera patient Desir  .  ”But it can't end there. Because today there is still cholera in all the country. I got cholera. My mother died from cholera, too. This battle hasn't finished. And they can't just talk about this doing this in 2017 this is urgent. They need to say how much money the are giving to each person and exactly how they will eliminate cholera. Our children died, our wives died.” What the plan entails, The General Assembly will have to approve hundreds of thousands of dollars in financial payments for Ban's   approach to take flight.  Track One of the plan focuses on responding and reducing the incident of cholera through better access to health care and improved water and sanitation systems. Track Two focuses on community projects and initiatives to alleviate the disease's impact through education grants and   for example. Moon called on member states for voluntary contributions to supplement funding from the World Bank and the   Development Bank. ”We cannot turn away from the task until the job is done. I count on all of you to see this effort through    to continue and increase your support until cholera is defeated,” he said. ”Without your political will and financial support, we have only good intentions and words.” An apology 'years overdue' The UN acknowledged its involvement in the outbreak in August, indicating an apology was on its way. But Thursday's message stops short of acknowledging that it caused the epidemic. US diplomat Isobel Coleman welcomed the apology as a ”meaningful symbol of atonement” that helped restore the UN's credibility. She called for greater clarity on the approach so member states can make sound financial decisions. ”For maximum,   impact, we encourage you to ensure Track 2 programing complements those activities undertaken under Track 1, such as   programs related to the water, sanitation and hygiene programs. Those activities undertaken under Track 1 and Track 2 should also be coordinated with the wider humanitarian assistance being provided to Haiti,” Coleman said in a statement. Sen. Edward J. Markey, the top Democrat on the US Senate Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health Policy, expressed hope that member states would support the plan. ”This apology from the United Nations has been years overdue and is an important first step for justice for the people of Haiti,” Markey said in a statement.  ”The people of Haiti have long deserved more than just acknowledgment for the pain and sacrifice they have suffered in great part due to UN negligence. The UN must now put its money where its mouth is and provide compensation to the Haitian people suffering from the devastation caused by the cholera epidemic.”"
40529,59398,Conway: 'Biggest piece of fake news' was idea Trump can't win,CNN,Daniella Diaz,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Washington (CNN) The campaign managers for both major presidential nominees decried Thursday the role fake news played in the 2016 election, though Trump's manager Kellyanne Conway used her criticism to include pundits who doubted the Republican nominee's chances. ”I think the biggest piece of fake news in the election was that Trump couldn't win,” Conway told CNN's Jake Tapper during a discussion at Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics, referencing the widespread predictions that Trump couldn't win the Electoral College votes he needed. Robby Mook, Clinton's former campaign manager, said false or misleading news was ”huge problem” his operation faced, including some evidence that the election meddling came from overseas.  ”Look, Jake, I think there's a lot of things we need to examine coming out of this election . .. I still think we have to investigate what happened with Russia here. We cannot have foreign, and I would say foreign aggressors here, intervening in our elections.”  He continued: ”The Russian were propagating fake news through Facebook and other outlets, but look, we also had, and this is with all due respect to Kellyanne and her colleagues, look Steve Bannon ran Breitbart News, which was notorious for peddling stories like this.”  Trump has picked Bannon to be a senior adviser in his administration. Bannon is a former executive at Breitbart News, which he's referred to as ”the platform for the ” a   political movement rife with white nationalist,   and racist ideologies. Conway was also asked by Tapper whether   Trump's tweet on voter fraud Sunday was presidential behavior.  On Sunday, Trump alleged, without evidence, that ”millions of people” voted illegally for Clinton and otherwise he would have won the popular vote in the 2016 election. This was an unprecedented allegation by a  . ”In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,” Trump tweeted. Conway said that because he tweeted it, it was presidential behavior.  ”Well he's   so that's presidential behavior yes,” she said about the tweet. ”The fact is that this man is now President of the USA and he's tackling very big issues . .. he is committed to making good on the promises on, frankly, the plans, and he's going to be focused on that. Not everybody trying to nitpick what he does.”"
40530,59399,"Insults fly when Trump, Clinton aides meet",CNN,Maeve Reston,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,," (CNN) Four weeks after the election, tensions between top operatives at the Trump and Clinton campaigns erupted during a Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics discussion that was intended to record history by drawing out the internal deliberations of both campaigns. Facing off at long tables on opposite sides of the room during a   panel, raw emotions on both sides exploded as operatives debated how Trump had won the divisive campaign. There were periods of calm, substantive discussion about data, metrics and target states, but many moments where tempers flared, with acrimony mirroring the 2016 race. Advisers on the opposing sides shouted over each other. Accusations of lying flew between them. There was lots of   on both sides. Operatives snapped at one another for interrupting, as an air of mutual contempt settled within the room. Trump Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway called members of Clinton's team ”bitter.” ”Hey guys, we won,” Conway said at one point, challenging Clinton's team to ”accept the results of the election.” ”He was the better candidate. That's why we won.” But the Clinton team did not back down. Chief Strategist Joel Benenson charged that the Trump campaign was successful, in part, by sending a series of ”dog whistles” and messages with racial overtones that appealed to white voters who believed the government favored minorities. Benenson pressed the Trump team to explain exactly who their supporters want ”to take America back from.” He disputed the Trump team's argument that his economic message led him to victory. Clinton won a majority of voters who were concerned about the economy, he said, while Trump won more voters who believe minorities are favored in this country. Clinton Senior Adviser Karen Finney added that Trump had tapped into ”underlying cultural anxiety about change that we were not willing to do.” In a key moment that flipped the initial tone from fairly civil to acrimonious, Clinton advisers Jennifer Palmeiri and Finney charged the Trump campaign with providing a platform for white supremacist views by hiring Breitbart Chief Executive Steve Bannon. The Trump team had elevated the     movement into the mainstream, they said, with Palmieri adding that Clinton's speech denouncing the extremist movement was the proudest moment of the campaign.    ”Are you going look me in the face and say I provided a platform for white supremacists?” Kellyanne Conway asked incredulously. Both Palmieri and Finney nodded and said ”yes.” ”I would rather lose than win the way you did,” Palmieri said. ”You guys are pathetic,” Trump adviser David Bossie replied, accusing them of a smear campaign against Bannon.  Bossie argued that Clinton lost not because of headwinds, but because of distrust due to a long series of ”  wounds” dating back to the 1990s from the Whitewater scandal to the missing files at the Rose Law Firm. Bossie and Conway charged that the Clinton campaign was in denial about why their candidate had lost    in part their refusal to acknowledge that she was a ”bad candidate.” Clinton adviser Mandy Grunwald said the Trump campaign had operated in the world of ”dark arts.” As an example, she flashed the final issue of the National Enquirer, essentially describing Clinton as a corrupt criminal who should be thrown in jail. ”I don't think you guys give yourself enough credit for the negative campaign you ran,” Grunwald said. ”I think it was an incredibly effective negative campaign, and you guys don't get credit for it.” To the irritation of Trump officials, the Clinton team argued that the results have not given Trump a mandate to govern. At one point when Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio was saying that the Clinton campaign had failed to understand the fact that 70% of voters believed the country was on the wrong track, her Campaign Manager Robby Mook interrupted: ”We won the popular vote.” Over the course of the   conference, the Clinton team attributed their general election loss to a myriad of factors. They said they faced huge headwinds within the electorate because of the strong desire for change: ”We underestimated the force of that wind of change,” Mook said. But they focused repeatedly on what they viewed as the destructive impact of FBI Director James Comey's press conference and his two letters about the investigation into Clinton's emails on her private server. That hurt Clinton particularly among suburban women and younger voters in the final days, they said. 'You guys took everything Trump said so literally' Clinton advisers also blamed unfair media coverage    noting that it was a struggle every day to get Clinton's message to break through in a media environment dominated by Trump. There was also fierce criticism of the press by the Trump campaign. One of the odder complaints came from former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. ”This is the problem with the media. You guys took everything Trump said so literally,” Lewandowski said. ”The American people didn't. They understood it. They understood sometimes when you have a conversation with people, whether it's around the dinner table or at a bar, you're going to say things and sometimes you don't have all the facts to back it up.” Several Clinton advisers also argued that there was an unfair ”double standard” for Clinton within the press that was driven partly by her gender. Mook noted that the press often focused on how she delivered her message in a way that they would not have been scrutinized in a male candidate. ”She's been an uncomfortable presence for a long time” by breaking gender barriers, Palmieri said. When the Clinton team was asked whether they would have done anything differently, Palmieri said one mistake was not arguing for a fourth debate shortly before the election. When Clinton wasn't on stage with Trump, it was difficult for her message to break through, she said    setting up a dynamic of ”Hillary versus Hillary.” ”What hurt us was (the Trump campaign) coming after her or the press picking at us,” Palmieri said. Clinton's advisers said they were harmed by Russians meddling in the election and the ”drip, drip, drip” of news about Clinton's emails, followed by the hacking of John Podesta's emails that revealed internal campaign deliberations. They also acknowledged that they did not perform as well as they needed to among younger voters one key reason for that, they said, was Comey's interference in the election. ”Undecided voters didn't break our way,” Mook said of Election Night. ”That Comey letter had a huge effect,” he said, calling it ”probably a  .”   Both Mook and Benenson said while the race was incredibly fluid in the final weeks, they were closely watching both Trump and Clinton defectors    voters who were considering third party candidates. In the final weeks before Election Day, they were coming home    first to Trump and then to Clinton. But the first Comey letter 11 days before the election stalled that movement back to Clinton, Benenson said. ”Those last 11 days we couldn't get them back,” he said.  Asked about the heated    White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz Friday said he was ”not surprised” that the program was ”particularly” feisty.” Schultz added that he was also ”not sure that's a bad thing,” saying that it's important to look back at the decisions of a campaign. ”It's ok to be candid and to honestly look back at the decisions you made, the decisions your opponent made and how that played out in the context of the race when you're not in the heat of it,” Schultz said.  Schultz also downplayed stark campaign trail rhetoric between Obama and Trump. ”I think that the President did speak out on the trail early and often about his profound differences with Mr. Trump,” Schultz said. ”But Mr. Trump won. He won the election on November 8th. The President has made clear that our priority in light of that election is to provide for a seamless transition of power.”"
40533,59402,"Two presidents, two Indiana visits, two partisan reactions",CNN,Eric Bradner,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,," (CNN) The Democratic President and the Republican   each made early visits to Indiana to shine a spotlight on their job efforts.  And both found that over eight years, one thing hasn't changed: Partisanship.  When Obama did it, the Republicans was furious. And now that   Trump is doing it, Democrats are lashing out.  Obama's first trip in the White House was to   northern Indiana    where his first major legislative victory, the $800 billion stimulus package, would allow the quick injection of federal dollars to help rescue Elkhart's lagging RV industry.  Trump's first trip into the country since Election Day was to Indiana, as well. He championed a deal struck with an air conditioning manufacturer to hand over $7 million in state government subsidies to keep the company from moving hundreds of jobs to Mexico.  Obama's visit was three months later than Trump's. The scope of the stimulus was much larger. And Obama has created millions of jobs in office, while Trump hasn't yet begun the task of advancing a national economic policy through Congress. How Trump got Carrier to stay, But both were touting how the use of taxpayer dollars allowed them to keep jobs in the USA that otherwise would have been lost.  Suddenly    and in a   reversal from 2009    Republicans were comfortable Thursday with the notion of government choosing winners and losers, while Democrats were worried about the broader implications.  ”Well, I'm pretty happy that we're keeping jobs in America    aren't you?” House Speaker Paul Ryan,   told reporters in Washington.  He brushed aside questions about the specifics of the deal, saying he thinks ”it's pretty darn good that people are keeping their jobs in Indiana instead of going to Mexico.”  Ryan and other Republicans, though, spent years bashing Obama over the stimulus    which Ryan called ”political patronage, corporate welfare and cronyism at their worst” at the 2012 Republican National Convention.  The Republicans targeted the Obama administration's   $535 million loan guarantee to Solyndra, a green energy company that ultimately failed and declared bankruptcy.   Republicans have also bashed the Obama administration's 2013 effort to rescue the bankrupt city of Detroit.  Conservative Trump critic Erick Erickson compared Carrier to Solyndra on Twitter, writing: ”Anyone know how this is different from Solyndra? The Republicans opposed Solyndra. Corporate welfare isn't conservative.” Democrats, meanwhile, championed Obama's stimulus package    as well as the bank bailout's inclusion of money to rescue the automotive industry    early in his presidency.  But party officials quickly denounced Trump for his deal with Carrier.  Trump, Clinton aides clash over 2016 campaign, On Thursday, the Democratic National Committee blasted Trump, saying in a statement: ”Every American job is important, but it's clear that Trump not only got rolled by Carrier, he set a dangerous precedent that companies can easily shake down taxpayers with the mere threat of outsourcing jobs.”  The deal Democrats were criticizing with Indiana is worth $700, 000 per year for 10 years. It includes $500, 000 annually in corporate income tax breaks and $200, 000 per year in training grants.  That deal's size is similar to other major offers Indiana economic officials have extended to businesses    and is similar to the tax abatements and credits states and municipalities run by Democrats and Republicans offer nationally.  Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders also blasted the deal. ”Trump's   solution is only making the problem of wealth inequality in America even worse,” he wrote in a Washington Post  . ”He wants to treat corporate irresponsibility with kid gloves,” Sanders wrote of Trump. ”The problem with our rigged economy is not that our policies have been too tough on corporations it's that we haven't been tough enough.” But even as Democrats criticized Trump, some members of the party said the Republicans   deserves credit.  Former Obama strategist David Axelrod tweeted: ”Without knowing details of what was promised, any fair reading is that the Carrier intervention is a good early win” for Trump."

Sachs was reported to have suffered from vascular dementia for four years before his death. He was buried on Thursday December 1. ”It wasn't very pleasant,” his wife Melody told the Daily Mail. ”It didn't get really bad until quite near the end. I nursed Andrew, I was there for every moment of it.” Born in Germany, Sachs' parents fled Nazi persecution of the Jews by moving to the United Kingdom, where their son eventually became a   actor and comedian. Apart from his iconic role on ”Fawlty Towers,” Sachs appeared in numerous radio adaptations and children's television series, as well as narrating audio books, including C. S. Lewis' ”Narnia” series. In 2008, a prank phone call to Sachs by comedian Russell Brand, in which Brand said he'd had sex with the actor's    granddaughter, resulted in the latter's resignation and an apology. Comedians bid farewell, Comedians and writers from around the world took paid tribute to Sachs on social media, complimenting his character and acting abilities. ”Fawlty Towers” creator John Cleese said Sachs had been a ”very sweet, gentle and kind man.” ”I first saw him in 'Habeas Corpus' on stage in 1973,” Cleese said on Twitter. ”I could not have found a better Manuel. Inspired.” ”Blackadder” actor Tony Robinson expressed his grief at Sachs' passing. ”A true friend and a kindred spirit,” he said on his Twitter account. Comedy writer Edgar Wright said Sachs, in his role as Manuel, spun ”comic gold.”"

Marlon Jones, a member of a Jamaican narcotics ring, is accused of fatally shooting four people in Los Angeles. ”Jones has violent tendencies and may attempt to flee internationally,” the FBI said. ” He has ties to NY, New Jersey, Connecticut, California, Tennessee, the Virgin Islands and Jamaica.” Los Angeles police said the shooting happened late in the night of October 15 in a house that contains a Jamaican restaurant a few blocks south of the Santa Monica Freeway, near the Crenshaw neighborhood. Jones attended a rival gang's celebration, where he shot someone in the head, the FBI said. Other people started shooting and the violence ended with four people dead and at least 10 wounded, the FBI said. Los Angeles authorities charged Jones with four counts of murder. Federal authorities charged him with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. Investigators said they think Jones was born in Jamaica and was in the USA illegally. He has given different birth dates, ranging from 1975 to 1981, and various places of birth, ranging from the Virgin Islands to Wisconsin.  A reward of $100, 000 has been offered for information leading to his arrest. Jones is described as black,    or    and   pounds. Some of his aliases are Rasheen Brantley, Floyd Evans, Floyd Evans Jr. Anthony Howard, Philip L. Schepacarter, Anthony Winter, Anthony Wynter and ”Junior,” the FBI said. The FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list has been in existence since 1950, the FBI says in an FAQ about the list. The Criminal Investigative Division at FBI headquarters seeks nominations from the agency's 56 field offices. The CID agents and the agency office of public affairs review the names and the FBI's executive management gives final approval."
40541,59410,Reporter's notebook: The view from Ohio voters,CNN,Phil Mattingly,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Cincinnati (CNN) Sitting across from her laptop at a coffee shop Thursday morning, Monica Perdomo had no doubt. None. What   Trump had just done in the state next door    Indiana    was going to happen in Ohio soon. Period.  ”Replicated? Certainly,” she said when I asked if she expected a similar deal to be struck for any Ohio manufacturer threatening to relocate jobs.  Dave Cagigas, who came into the shop located in Hyde Park neighborhood on the east side of Cincinnati a few minutes later agreed completely    but went further. This deal struck to keep   jobs in Indiana at the company Carrier from relocating to Mexico was something that would be replicated not just in Ohio, but nationwide. Why? Because that's exactly what Trump said would happen during the campaign.  ”He truly wants to make a difference and save jobs here,” he said.  Landing in Cincinnati as the deal was being finalized, I was intrigued to see how Trump supporters    and those who didn't like him at all    would react to the Carrier agreement. I came here to cover the first stop on the  's ”Thank You” tour, but this seemed like a better use of reporting time. The holes in the deal have become crystal clear. The idea that it could be replicated in Ohio, or really any other state, is suspect at best. But having covered Trump's campaign for much of the last 11 months, I had an idea of how it would be perceived, regardless of the details or potential problems and red flags. The below thread is what I found:        "
40543,59412,Weiner hit with fines by campaign board,CNN,,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,," (CNN) Anthony Weiner faces fines totaling $65, 000 for violations made in his   campaign for mayor of NY, including for using campaign funds to pay for a personal phone, the city's Campaign Finance Board announced Thursday.  The penalties come after a routine audit done by the board on all candidates who accepted public funding in the city's 2013 election. Among the ten financial indiscretions noted by the board, Weiner is accused of overpaying a fundraising consultant and improperly continuing payments to the company Vimeo after the end of the election. The board also says Weiner used campaign cash to cover more than $1, 500 in dry cleaning and personal phone bills.  Weiner, who resigned from Congress in 2011 after his first   scandal, was in the midst of a political comeback when a second set of sexts surfaced, derailing his campaign for the Democratic nomination for mayor of NY. He finished fifth in the race. A spokeswoman for the Weiner for Mayor campaign, Barbara Morgan, declined to comment on the fines. Audits on the use of public funds by several other candidates in the 2013 mayor's race    including the eventual winner, Democrat Bill de Blasio    have not yet been completed, according to a board spokesman, Matthew Sollars.    READ MORE: Anthony Weiner scandal: A timeline,   percent of the candidates in citywide primaries in 2013 participated in the public financing program, which matches small donations to a campaign at a value of six to one, Sollars said. Weiner, who is married to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, accepted more than $1. 6 million in public funds and spent nearly $7 million in the 2013 race, city records show.  Abedin announced her separation from Weiner earlier this year after more   text messages came to light. Weiner's alleged texts to an underage girl in North Carolina brought the saga to its lowest point in October when an investigation by the FBI brought Clinton's own email scandal back into the spotlight, just 11 days before the election. Clinton, who had been investigated by the FBI for her use of a private email server during her time as the StateSecretary, was never charged with a crime. The FBI investigation into Weiner's alleged exchanges with the underage girl is still underway."
40552,59421,Michael Slager jury to resume deliberations Monday,CNN,,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,," (CNN) Deliberations will resume Monday morning after the jury in the murder trial of former North Charleston, South Carolina, police Officer Michael Slager told a judge Friday it has been unable to reach a unanimous decision.  Slager is charged with murder in the April 2015 shooting death of Walter Scott, an unarmed black man, after a traffic stop in North Charleston.  The case appeared headed for a mistrial, but the jury three times went back to deliberate Friday after indicating to the judge it was unable to gain a consensus. During one deliberation, a male juror took the unusual step of writing the judge a note, saying he couldn't vote for a conviction and wouldn't change his mind. ”I still cannot without a reasonable doubt convict the defendant,” the male juror wrote. ”I cannot and will not change my mind.”  A note from the foreman said that juror was the only one having the issue.  If convicted of murder, Slager faces 30 years to life in prison. Judge Clifton Newman allowed the jury, which began deliberating Wednesday night,  to consider the lesser offense of manslaughter, which carries a potential sentence of up to 30 years in prison.  South Carolina law says that a judge can only once instruct the jury to return to deliberate more. Newman did, and when the jurors returned, he explained they would have to consent to more time or they could indicate they were hopelessly deadlocked. The foreman said they would continue to discuss the case.  After more time, the judge stopped them again and asked whether they were deadlocked still or needed further time. The jury could use more time, the foreman answered.  Jurors deliberated until about 6 p. m. Friday before Newman sent them home.  The case, The jury of 11 white jurors and one   is considering the testimony of 55 witnesses given over the span of five weeks.    On the stand, Slager argued   saying he shot Scott as he ran away because Scott posed a threat and could have turned around and charged him. One of the key pieces of evidence in the trial was a   video of the altercation. In the video, Slager is seen chasing Scott, then shooting him in the back. Prosecutors said the two were 18 feet apart when Slager opened fire.      Slager, who is white, also is scheduled to go on trial early next year on federal charges, including civil rights offenses, related to the shooting."

40555,59424,"Trump national security pick once wrote Chelsea Manning should be tried for treason, executed if guilty",CNN,,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,," (CNN) KT McFarland, Trump's pick to be his deputy national security adviser, once wrote that former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning should be tried for treason and executed if found guilty. Manning was convicted and sentenced to 35 years in prison for handing over a trove of classified documents to Wikileaks. McFarland, a national security analyst and host of an online Fox News show for years, made the comments in a weekly column on the Fox News' website. ”It's time to up the charges,” she wrote of Manning in 2010. ”Let's charge him and try him for treason. If he's found guilty, he should be executed.” The most recent U. S. Military execution of a service member was in 1961. McFarland was also critical of Wikileaks's founder Julian Assange in 2010, calling his group a ”terrorist organization” and arguing that Assange was waging cyberwarfare against the USA.  She once called for him to be tried by a military tribunal in a 2010 television appearance. ”WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange isn't some     protestor leaking documents in hopes of ending an unpopular war. He's waging cyberwar on the USA and the global world order,” McFarland wrote on Fox News. ”Mr. Assange and his fellow hackers are terrorists and should be prosecuted as such.” In another column, she said Assange should be tried to fullest extent of the law ”as a warning to those who would follow his example.” She added that the U. S. government should create new authority to prosecute both Manning and Assange. ”If we don't have the legal authority to prosecute him for espionage and to go after his alleged   Pvt. Bradley Manning for treason and conspiracy, we should create it,” she wrote. McFarland's view of the organization, however, appears to have shifted.   On her Twitter feed, she linked to stories on the Podesta emails, even using a hashtag that was started by Wikileaks for their document release. In an October on Fox News's RedEye, she mocked  Clinton's proposed campaign slogans, which were revealed by Wikileaks.  In another appearance, she said Assange was trying to show and bring down corruption. ”As far as the Wikileaks, not the Russian connection, but the Julian   connection, I think he's trying to bring down and show corruption, wherever it exists,” she said in an October television appearance. ”They've just gotten their hands on Democrat stuff. I have no doubt that if they find their way into Republican emails that those will be released at some point to embarrass and influence as well.” McFarland and the Trump transition team did not return requests for comment."
40556,59425,China lodges complaint over Trump-Taiwan call,CNN,Stephen Collinson,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,," (CNN) China's foreign ministry said Saturday it has lodged a complaint with the USA over a controversial phone call between   Trump and Taiwan's President that has overturned decades of diplomatic protocol. China views Taiwan as a renegade province and, since 1979, the US has acknowledged Beijing's claim that Taiwan is part of China, with   relations governed by a set of protocols known as the ”one China” policy.  This means there are no formal diplomatic relations between the USA and Taiwan    so Trump's decision to take Taiwanese President Tsai  's call could risk a major upset. ”We have noticed relevant reports and lodged solemn representation with the relevant side in the USA,” said a statement Saturday from China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang. ”I must point out that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inseparable part of the Chinese territory . .. The 'one China' principle is the political foundation of   relations. ”We urge the relevant side in the US to adhere to the 'one China' policy, abide by the pledges in the three joint   communiques, and handle issues related to Taiwan carefully and properly to avoid causing unnecessary interference to the overall  . S. relationship.” Earlier Saturday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi labeled the phone call ”a shenanigan by the Taiwan side” when he was asked about it on the sidelines of a foreign policy seminar. ”The 'one China' policy is the cornerstone of a healthy  . S. relationship. I hope this political foundation won't be disrupted or damaged,” he said.  Former US envoy: Trump 'winging it' with Taiwan call, First time in decades, Trump's transition team said Friday that the   had chatted with Tsai, who passed along her congratulations. ”During the discussion, they noted the close economic, political, and security ties (existing) between Taiwan and the USA.   Trump also congratulated President Tsai on becoming President of Taiwan earlier this year.” The chat marks the first publicly reported call between a US President or   and the leader of Taiwan since Washington established diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1979, said Bonnie Glaser, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  It is perhaps the first major sign of the unpredictability that Trump has vowed to bring to   US relations with the rest of the world. The call, first reported by the Financial Times, risks throwing   relations into a tailspin before Trump takes the oath of office January 20.  And it has prompted questions over whether Trump intends a shift in US policy, or if this was a blunder by a team with limited experience of international affairs. Trump emphasized Friday night that Taipei initiated the call.  ”The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!” tweeted the  .  He soon followed up by tweeting, ”Interesting how the U. S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.” Taiwan's President published a statement Friday night about the phone call on an official website, which she described as an ”intimate and relaxed conversation” lasting 10 minutes.  The two also shared their views on important policy points, the statement said, according to a translation, ”in particular, to promote the domestic economy and strengthen national defense, allowing the people better lives and a guarantee of security. The two briefly exchanged opinions on the situation in the Asia region.” According to Taiwan's Presidential spokesman Alex Huang, Huang told CNN via text message that both sides agreed ahead of time before making contact, but would not give any further details including exactly when they agreed to the call.  Global Headaches: The 10 biggest issues facing Trump, Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on ”AC360” that she wouldn't go beyond what the transition team statement said. But the   was fully aware of the call's implications, Conway suggested. ”He either will disclose or not disclose the full contents of that conversation but he's well aware of what US policy has been,” Conway said. The Trump Organization is also denying reports that it is considering building luxury hotels in the Taiwanese city of Taoyuan after the city's mayor was quoted last month as saying a representative did visit.  The mayor Cheng   told local media the Trump representative did visit in September and that company was interested in developing there.  ”There have been no authorized visits to Taiwan on behalf of Trump Hotels for the purposes of development nor are there any active conversations. Trump Organization is not planning any expansion into Taiwan,” a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization Saturday told CNN. The spokeswoman, who asked not to be identified by name, added that the Trump Organization employee who was there was not part of the development team and was not there for those reasons but for sales purposes for existing Trump hotels. 'No change' By Friday night, China had already reached out to the Obama administration. White House officials declined to comment on diplomatic discussions.  Ned Price, a spokesman for the US National Security Council, said ”there is no change to our longstanding policy on   issues.” Insults fly when Trump, Clinton aides meet, ”We remain firmly committed to our 'one China' policy based on the three Joint Communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act,” he said. ”Our fundamental interest is in peaceful and stable   relations.” A different Obama administration official said there was no contact with either the White House or State Department about the call beforehand.  Meanwhile, former US StateSecretary Henry Kissinger met with China's President Xi Jinping Friday, China's   news agency Xinhua reported.  Kissinger    secretary of state from      is credited with secret diplomacy that helped Nixon open up Communist China to America and the West. During their Beijing meeting, Kissinger told Xi ”that he believes it is the expectation of the U. S. new administration to facilitate sustained, stable and better growth of U. S.  relations,” Xinhua reported. 'Major pivots' The USA acknowledged China's claim that there is one China and that Taiwan is part of China in a joint communique signed in 1979 at the time of the formal establishment of relations between Washington and Beijing. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, publicly blasted Trump for his actions in a series of tweets.  While it will soon be Trump's right to shift policy, alliances and strategy, Murphy said, ”what has happened in the last 48 hours is not a shift. These are major pivots in foreign policy   any plan. That's how wars start.” He added that ”if they aren't pivots   just radical temporary deviations   allies will walk if they have no clue what we stand for. Just as bad.” Trump's dramatic search for a secretary of state, CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated that Trump transition adviser Stephen Yates was in Taiwan and was involved in facilitating the call.

40557,59426,Man released in fatal shooting of former NFL player ,CNN,,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,," (CNN) Former NFL running back Joe McKnight was fatally shot during an apparent   incident while standing beside a man's car at a suburban New Orleans intersection, authorities said Friday. McKnight, 28, who played for the NY Jets and Kansas City Chiefs, and Ronald Gasser apparently became involved in an Thursday afternoon incident on the Crescent City Connection, formerly known as the Greater New Orleans Bridge, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said at a news conference.  The problem may have been that one man cut the other off in traffic, Normand said. One driver followed the other to an intersection in Terrytown, where McKnight parked his Audi Q7 SUV on the right shoulder of the road, a sheriff's office news release said. Gasser's Infiniti G37   sedan was in the right lane and parallel to the SUV, the release said. Witnesses said the two were ”in a heated verbal exchange” from their vehicles, officials said.  At some point, Gasser ”discharged three rounds from a .  semiautomatic handgun from the driver's seat of the blue Infiniti through the open passenger window. These rounds struck (McKnight) who had previously exited the gray Audi Q7 and was positioned at the passenger window of the Infiniti,” the release said. Gasser remained at the scene, handed over his weapon to authorities and admitted to shooting McKnight, Normand said. No gun was found in McKnight's possession, Normand said.  Normand said Gasser, 54, was released from custody Thursday night.  In explaining why Gasser was allowed to leave, Normand said authorities need to talk to more witnesses. ”If you make a rush to judgment and you make a strategic or tactical error from the beginning (it's) very hard to recover later,” he said. Normand said an arrest triggers court hearings at which evidence must be revealed. ”We did not want to get to that threshold at that point in time,” he said. He said that the    law ”is one of the issues that looms on the horizon. . ..” Reggie Bush: 'I was pretty angry' The shooting shocked New Orleans and the football community, including Reggie Bush, a current NFL player who preceded McKnight at the University of Southern California. ”I have to admit when I heard today that the guy was released without charges I was pretty angry,” Bush said in an interview with Brooke Baldwin on CNN. ”And I still am pretty angry. And I'm not sure what all the details of the situation are but I know that it just doesn't make sense.” Bush said the killing ”seems unreal because for me we just had to bury one of my   Will Smith, who went through a very similar situation because of road rage.” In April, Will Smith, who played defensive end for the New Orleans Saints, was shot to death and his wife was wounded in downtown New Orleans, apparently after a traffic dispute with another man, authorities said. Cardell Hayes was charged with   murder in Smith's death. 'This is not about race' Sheriff Normand said there's no evidence the shooting had a racial basis, despite heavy social media traffic on that subject. McKnight is black and Gasser is white. ”Everybody wants to make this about race,” Normand said. ”This is not about race.” The sheriff said protesters who had already gathered on the streets of New Orleans would not be allowed to block traffic. The sheriff noted that ”the man who raised” McKnight was a former deputy sheriff for Jefferson Parish. He said people in the sheriff's office are close to McKnight's family, but ”this (investigation will be done in the proper way.” Jefferson Parish Coroner Gerald Cvitanovich said McKnight was shot in the right shoulder, the right chest and the hand. Alleged prior incident, In 2006, a misdemeanor charge stemming from an alleged road rage incident involving Gasser was dismissed, the sheriff's office said.  The charge came after a man reported to police that Gasser followed him in his pickup, got out and punched him several times in a gas station parking lot. The sheriff's office said it is unsure why the case was dismissed.  Court records show Gasser failed to show for his arraignment in September 2006 and early in October he paid a fine for contempt. On November 27, the case was dismissed by the district attorney. court records say.  High school hero, McKnight, a resident of nearby Kenner, was a football standout at John Curtis Christian High School in River Ridge, Louisiana. He was named Louisiana's ”Mr. Football” in 2006, and The   newspaper named him the male high school athlete of the decade in 2009. Rivals. com, a recruiting website, ranked him the best running back in the 2007 graduating class and the   player in that class. Parade magazine named McKnight the   of the year, along with Jimmy Clausen.  McKnight went on to play at the University of Southern California, where he was hyped as ”the next Reggie Bush,” the Daily Trojan's website reported.  McKnight never matched Bush, who led the school to a national championship, but he established himself as a dependable running back, the Daily Trojan said. Pro career, After his junior year, McKnight left USC and was drafted into the NFL. He played from 2010 to 2012 with the NY Jets, working mostly as a kick returner on special teams. One of his highlights was returning a kickoff 107 yards against the Baltimore Ravens. McKnight sat out 2013, played 2014 with the Kansas City Chiefs and played briefly in 2015 with Canadian pro football teams the Saskatchewan Roughriders and the Edmonton Eskimos. McKnight had been in talks about playing for another NFL team, McKnight's stepfather, Elmo Lee, told CNN affiliate  .  CNN could not immediately confirm that statement. ”I just want people to know that this was not a troubled kid. The boy was just trying to make it back in the NFL, that's all he wanted to do,” Lee told the TV station. ”That was his whole dream since 6 years old. I've been knowing him from 6, and this is just senseless, and it has to stop. Somewhere it has to stop.” Tributes pour in, People who knew McKnight in the world of football were grieving. Bush  tweeted: ”RIP my brother Joe McKnight this one hurts bad.” Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll, who coached McKnight at USC, tweeted: ”Deeply saddened by the loss of Joe McKnight. This is a terrible tragedy. Everyone loved Joe and we are going to really miss him.” DeMaurice Smith, executive director of the National Football League Players Association, tweeted: ”The community of NFL players is saddened and shocked by the tragic loss of Joe McKnight. RIP.” Buffalo Bills coach Rex Ryan, who coached McKnight at the Jets, posted on the Bills webpage: ”Hearing this news about Joe McKnight is just so heartbreaking. He was such a great guy who meant a lot to a lot of people. When he first came to us at the Jets, he was this raw, talented kid. He had some issues as do a lot of guys.  ”Obviously, we know the background, him going through (Hurricane) Katrina and a lot of different things. But he was always determined to get    as a football player and better as a    I thought he did that. That was exciting for me to see. . .. ”Joe will be remembered for a lot of good things and I was proud to have known him and proud to have coached him.”"
40558,59427,A new 'Baby It's Cold Outside' (with consent),CNN,Alexandra King,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,," (CNN) A couple from Minnesota has   the classic Christmas song ”Baby It's Cold Outside” for a   audience, changing the song's lyrics to emphasize the importance of consent.    Lydia Liza and Josiah Lemanski, both from Minneapolis, said they were inspired to rework the song after bonding over a mutual dislike of the original's lyrics, which were penned in 1944 by Frank Loesser. The duet features a man trying to dissuade a woman from leaving a party despite her repeated protestations that she has to go home. ”What's in this drink?” is one of the female lines. ”What's the sense in hurtin' my pride?” implores the male voice. The song's seeming disregard for the woman's desire to leave never sat well with Lemanski or Liza. ”I've always had a big problem with the song. It's so aggressive and inappropriate,” said Lemanski, 25. Liza, 22, said she felt the same way as her boyfriend. ”We started thinking of the   questions that song has,” she said. ”You never figure out if she gets to go home. You never figure out if there was something in her drink. It just leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth.” So Wednesday night, the couple decided to write a complete set of new lyrics. ”We wrote the whole thing in an hour and then we went back and used my little   microphone and did that in 15 minutes,” Liza recalled. And though the melody is still the same, the lyrics strike an entirely new chord.  ” I really can't   I'm fine with that” opens the song, as the lyrics recall the original's format of a woman leaving a party. Except in Liza and Lemanski's version, she does so without protest, the man helps her get home safely and the fictional couple makes a date the next day at The Cheesecake Factory. ”I ought to say no, no, no,” sings Liza. ”You reserve the right to say no,” croons Lemanski. And as for that dubious ”What's in this drink?” line. It's still there. Except, in the new version, the question is actually answered    by Lemanski, who responds with the    ””Pomegranate La Croix” (obviously). ”I thought we were just doing like a really good, cool, funny thing and it just felt right,” Liza said. ”And emphasizing consent is one of the causes that I've always really been behind because I don't think I can think of one friend of mine who's a woman who hasn't been in dangerous situations with men. I've always cared about this so much,” she added. But after the duo uploaded the song to SoundCloud, the couple found that what started out as a shared gripe between a boyfriend and girlfriend also resonated with the public at large. ”We've heard a lot of people say, 'Wow, we never actually paid attention to the lyrics before    this is awful! '” said Liza. The couple also said they hoped the song would raise awareness of the need for consent, given the problem of sexual assault on college campuses. ”It's not just a rare thing    it happens all the time, everywhere. Every day. And I'm afraid for my sister. And I'm afraid for my friends. And I hope that this song gets people thinking about it,” Lemanski said. Liza added that she hoped that the song would inspire others to take action to help prevent violence against women. ”I hope it will be on people's minds and that people will donate to charity or do some volunteer work at shelters or sexual assault centers. Like, if you think about this and you think it's a problem, definitely step out of your comfort zone and do something and help someone,” she said. And having successfully designated their   ”Baby It's Cold Outside” as an unofficial anthem for the importance of consent, the couple joked that there were some other candidates for the Liza and Lemanski treatment.  ”A lot of people have suggested a bunch of songs, like Ella Fitzgerald's 'She Didn't Say Yes, She Didn't Say No' and Robin Thicke's 'Blurred Lines,'” said Liza. ”We'll just do a whole album,” she laughed. Read the original lyrics to ”Baby It's Cold Outside” here and check out Lydia Liza and Josiah Lemanski's version below. I really can't   I'm fine with that, I've got to go   I'm cool with that, This evening has   hoping you get home safe, So very  'm glad you had a real good time, My mother will start to   her so she knows that you're coming, Father will be pacing the   get your car   So really I'd better   rush.  Should I use the front or back door?  one are you pulling towards more?  The neighbors might   you're a real nice girl, What is this drink?  La Croix, I wish I knew   I can help you out, To break this   don't know what you're talking about, I ought to say no, no,   reserve the right to say no  At least I'm gonna say that I   reserve the right to say no, I really can't  . ..Well you don't have to, Baby it's cold outside, I've got to get   you know how to get there from here, Say, where is my  'll go and grab it my dear, You've really been  'll have to do this again, Yes I   'bout the Cheesecake Factory?

40560,59429,"First Brexit, then Trump, now Italy faces political shockwave",CNN,Ben Wedeman,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Rome (CNN) The world as we know it could come to an end this Sunday. Or it could be just another day. It depends on whom you talk to.  This weekend, Italians go to the polls to vote in a referendum on whether or not the country should amend its 1948 constitution.   The referendum is the brainchild of Matteo Renzi, Italy's energetic,    Prime Minister. His intention is to defang the upper house of the Italian Parliament, the Senato, by cutting its numbers from 315 to 100, thus reducing its powers dramatically, making it more of a consultative assembly.  Yes, if you read to the end of the previous paragraph, you'll probably agree it sounds dull as dust. But, in the eyes of some, the consequences of a ”No” vote could be catastrophic.  Proponents of the referendum say that the goal is to make the job of governing Italy less complicated. By allowing the cabinet to push through legislation in a reasonable time frame, Italy would become more efficient, productive and prosperous while simultaneously becoming less bureaucratic and bound up in red tape.  Italian politics is a noisy, messy,   game of musical chairs, with plenty of motion but little forward movement. The once humming economy is anemic: according to one study, incomes for 97% of Italians haven't gone up in a decade. The country's GDP hasn't really budged since the late 1990s.   Some opponents say that the proposed reforms don't go far enough, while others fear that a weakened Senate will eliminate an important check on power.  READ MORE: Italy's referendum a nightmare for Europe, Great wall of red tape, Regardless of where Italians stand on the upcoming referendum, few here believe all is well.  ”Foreigners think life in Italy is like walking on water,” an Italian woman in Rome recently told me over dinner. ”But we are really dragging ourselves through a swamp.”  Disclaimer: the Italian woman mentioned above is my wife of 32 years. Italy for me isn't just another posting. It's been an integral part of my life since the early 1980s. I'm roughly fluent in Italian, my children are all dual citizens and, for better or for worse, Italy is home.   If ”No” does win, the worry is that it will send all the wrong signals to foreign investors and financial markets: First, that Italy is simply unwilling to reform and to tear down its great wall of red tape.  Second, if the referendum fails and Prime Minister Renzi makes good on his vow to resign, Italy will plunge headlong into a period of political instability.   Many Italian banks already teetering on the edge of  bankruptcy could come crashing down, leading to a domino effect that will spread to the rest of Europe.  READ MORE: Italian banks drowning in bad debt, End of the European dream? If Renzi does step down, others could come to power through early elections    including, possibly, the   and      Beppe Grillo and his Five Star Movement.  Grillo, much like Trump, has capitalized on widespread disaffection with the status quo. His movement, founded in 2009, now appears to garner almost as much support as Renzi's   Partito Democratico. The Five Star Movement, which refuses to call itself a party and won key mayoral elections in Turin and Rome earlier this year, is at best Euroskeptic at worst Eurocidal.   Foreign observers fear that if Grillo comes to power in an early election, he'll call a referendum to scrap the euro, go back to the Italian lira, and perhaps even follow Britain out of the EU.   For Italy    one of the original participants in the experiment in European unity    to pull the plug on the EU would be fatal.  With it, the European dream would die: borders would go up the current    albeit imperfect    European economic order would evaporate. Sounds grim.  But while the foreign media is alarmed about the prospect of a ”No” victory, many Italians are surprisingly blasé about the potential consequences.  ”Italy will not finish at all after this referendum,” Massimo Franco, a columnist for the daily Corriere della Sera, recently reassured me with a chuckle, ”whatever the outcome.”  READ MORE: In 2017, France and Germany will split Europe,   apocalypse, Italian law bans the publication of poll results in the final two weeks before any vote, but the last polls indicated that ”No” is leading ”Si” by at least 5%    although nearly 15% of those who say they will vote are still undecided. The ”No” camp spans the political spectrum, from the     Lega Nord to the far left, with Grillo's amorphous   Five Star Movement somewhere between the two.  Giovanni, a skeptical neighbor who likes to keep a close eye on comings and goings on our street, told me ”Don't forget: tell everyone you know to vote 'No. '” He is also a supporter of Trump, and recently showed me a used book he bought at a flea market. ”L'Arte di Fare Affari” —  ”The Art of the Deal.” When I asked him if he isn't worried about predictions of a   apocalypse, Giovanni makes a series of complicated hand gestures and bemused, dismissive grimaces.  Another supporter of Trump is Matteo Salvini, leader of the virulently   Lega Nord. I drove with Salvini in his camper van from one ”No” event to another in northern Tuscany last week. Along the way, he boasted of his meeting with the now   before the US election.  ”The lesson of Trump tells us we must have courage,” he told me. The Brexit vote and Trump's victory have put the wind into Salvini's sails, and he's hoping a ”No” victory will propel his party closer to power. I met some of the ”Si” crowd at a public meeting hosted by Renzi on Saturday in EUR, the   modernist suburb of Rome.  ”It is my first time to vote,”    Francesco told me in surprisingly good English. ”And I'm going to vote yes, to improve our country to make it similar to other European democracies.”  ”We have to change. It's enough,” said Stefania, a woman of a certain age who repeatedly referred to Prime Minister Renzi as a ”bravo ragazzo”    a ”good boy.”  READ MORE: Europe follows Trump to the right,     chance, The ”bravo ragazzo” certainly sounded convincing while making his case for ”Si.” The chance for real change, Renzi said, is a     opportunity. ”Yes or never. This needs to be clear. There will not be another chance.”  But the Italian people are nothing if not jaded. They greet grand promises with smirks and great projects with a shrug.  Wearing a blue baseball cap emblazoned with a big ”No,” unemployed construction worker Galileo Pasquale cheered the Lega Nord's Matteo Salvini at a rally in the quaint Tuscan town of Camaiore.  He is voting ”No” because he doesn't like Prime Minister Renzi and wants him to go.  But, I asked him, if Italy has had 65 governments since World War II, why do you expect number 66 to be any different?  Good question, he replied with a laugh: ”Umpteen governments have left us up to our necks in s***.”  Pasquale is hoping that someone will yank Italy out of it, but he's not looking at    to do so.

40561,59430,Skiers count cost of living 'White Circus' dream,CNN,,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,," (CNN) With skis in tow they travel the globe, flitting like fireflies to some of the world's most beautiful mountain locations. But the glamor and glitz of skiing's World Cup circuit, dubbed the ”White Circus,” is not quite as sparkly when you have to pay for it yourself. Take Lila Lapanja, a    member of the US Alpine B Ski Team. ”At my level I'm not funded,” she said recently before a   training session.  The US Ski and Snowboard Association (USSA) does cover her biggest expense, the salaries of the training, technical and medical staff who prepare her to race on the world stage. Totaling more than $100, 000 per skier, according to USSA president and chief executive Tiger Shaw, it's a significant sum.  But, as Lapanja noted of the   arrangement: ”I have to pay for all of my travel expenses.” Air fare, including several transatlantic flights each season as the circuit   the planet, isn't exactly cheap. Nor is lodging at the top ski resorts in Europe and North America.  Shaw estimates these additional sums average about $25, 000 per skier each season, the equivalent of a year's worth of college tuition at some US universities. It's a significant issue, one the USSA is well aware of.  The US system, which receives no government funding, is among the few top ski nations that can only fully finance the senior A Team. Despite private donations, there's a $2 million funding gap.  Luke Bodensteiner, the USSA's executive vice president of athletics, acknowledges the pitfalls. ”The most important thing for us to do,” he said, ”is to provide things for the athletes that nobody else can, that will make them great: excellent coaching, training facilities, sports signs.”  But, he admitted, ”it definitely loads the stress on the athlete.” Lapanja is lucky. Her sponsor, Clif Bar, helps offset a lot of the costs, which also include paying USSA to be a named athlete. Moreover, as a B Team member, she can also be reimbursed by race organizers for her appearances.  Yet the numbers are still daunting, so creativity and   become essential. Read: Eight skiers to watch this season, Read: The cutest prize in alpine sport? Read: Lindsey Vonn breaks arm in training, Read: Shiffrin's OMG moment after Trump win, Building the Brand, For Lapanja, this means melding her personality with causes she cares about. In 2015, she was named an official ambassador for the Snow Leopard Trust, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving the endangered species and their environment. ”It's my spirit animal,” she said of the elusive mountain cat. ”My biggest goal is to get in the start gate and have total belief in myself, to be like a snow leopard.” But Lapanja also admires the organization, and what it seeks to accomplish.  Such considerations play into how she builds her public persona, but the partnership's synergy is also a way to fund her quest to reach the 2018 Winter Games. Through the Snow Leopard Trust, Lapanja sells a   snow   shoulder bag, the proceeds of which go towards her travel costs. US skiers have, by necessity, become experts at building professional identities, and USSA mentors them in this endeavor. They help athletes not just market themselves, but turn this skill into employable, entrepreneurial occupations.  One of the keys to success in raising funds to train and build a brand is allowing the public full access to a skier's personality. And often, they're flamboyant.  Racing has always had a cast of splashy characters to complement the seemingly luxurious lifestyle on tour, racing the world's steepest and poshest peaks.  But now, according to Shaw, American skiers realize they need to show their more colorful sides to build a portrait of themselves, because skiing is very much like   driving    it's difficult to tell athletes apart on the course.  ”We wear helmets and goggles,” he said. The critical question becomes: ”what is that person like behind that mask?” The social media storm, Social media is one of the keys to unmasking the skier, and even the most   US racers feel pressure to continually produce content for their accounts. Many, however, find that Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram allow for more artistic, creative ways of expressing themselves. For Olympic gold medalist Mikaela Shiffrin, building her brand this way is fun.  ”Right now it's stimulating, it doesn't feel like a burden at this point,” she said. ”There are times when I'm lucky to say 'oh, it's my job! '” Yet, as anyone who has tried to grow an online following can attest, social media is deceptive and takes a lot of time. Most skiers accept this as a tool of the trade, even when they're exhausted from training sessions or public appearances like school visits and autograph signings.  In France, the skier behind the goggles is important in different ways.  The French system supports all of its skiers once they reach the national teams, through a mix of federation, Olympic Committee and federal funding. Tessa Worley, for example, who is fifth overall in the ladies World Cup standings, is one of 70 skiers paid by the French administration.  While the same pressure to fundraise doesn't exist, social media and building a personal identity is just as crucial for French ski racers' ability to reach the public. Despite images of   resorts and the heritage of legend   Killy, France's love of skiing as a pastime doesn't extend to ski racing. There's little live public television coverage of the sport, a hugely problematic issue for its current and future athletes.  But for Michel Vion, president of the French Ski Federation (FFS) there's another reason why social media has become an important outlet for his female racers.  ”There's less media coverage for women's [sports in general],” he said. ”If you have a superstar champion, of course she's covered in the same way as a man. But you need a superstar like Shiffrin.”  France hasn't produced such a skier in a while, making it difficult for the sport to garner attention, says Vion. Fighting stereotypes, But female athletes also face an uphill battle based on cultural perceptions of what women can    and cannot    do as professionals.  France's women's alpine team coach Anthony Sechaud, a longtime veteran of the ski circuit, believes these stereotypes contribute to the lack of media and public interest in elite racers.  ”People in France don't think that a woman can be a [professional] athlete in the same way as a man,” he said, citing the difficulty in getting coverage of Worley's giant slalom World Championship win in 2013.  While social media helps gain exposure, it comes with some strings attached.  ”When you are a female athlete, you have to be very good on and off the field,” Sechaud said. For men, it's a very different scenario, for they don't have the same pressure to look good or smile all the time as part of their public persona. Read: Serena Williams pens letter against gender bias  Worley is aware of the challenges to be more than just the best racer.  ”For skiing, you're in a race suit, you're wearing a helmet in the cold, it's not very feminine,” she admitted. Female skiers unfortunately need to present themselves differently from their male counterparts to bridge this gap in public perception.  It's a difficult situation to confront, to admit that you have to be more   by the public in order to prove you're just as good, if not better than, your male counterparts.  The double standard is hard and unfair, Sechaud emphasized. Society needs to change, to evolve. ”We have to think about women in sports as athletes first,” he said. Younger American skiers insist that they have not encountered such challenges. But others are quick to point out that the media spotlight on individual personalities like Lindsey Vonn or Julia Mancuso for bikini workouts and photospreads in Sports Illustrated's swimsuit edition feed off conventional gender stereotypes. On marriage, Racers like   U. S. ski team veteran Resi Stiegler acknowledge that while such ploys may seem odd or bring negative attention to the team, they also bring benefits.   ”It's done wonders for our sport because people know what it is now,” she said. ”It gives us more opportunities, to have more income at times.” The   old finds that gender stereotypes surface in other ways and there's very much a sense that women sacrifice more than men to remain on the professional circuit.  ”You have lot of [people] questioning how long you're going to do it for,” she said.  She's frequently asked when she will stop racing, have children, and start a family.  ”Whenever I want!” Stiegler insisted, noting that the same questions are never posed to her male colleagues in their mid to  . While women's ability to have kids later in life is starting to change the   nature of this conversation, it still frustrates pros who field such queries.   Stiegler strives to be an example, to break the barrier, and prove to younger colleagues that it's possible to be a professional female racer well into your 30s.

Aware that her pro days won't last forever, she aims to win as frequently as possible to set an example to younger colleagues and encourage them to set the bar higher. The morning after fielding questions about whether she feels pressure as a woman over performance and her age, Worley skied to a World Cup giant slalom victory in Killington, Vermont, her first podium appearance since 2013.

40563,59432,Inside the mind of 'Mad Dog' Mattis,CNN,Peter Bergen,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,," (CNN) In picking Gen. Jim Mattis for Defense secretary,   Trump has said that he found his ”Gen. George Patton.” Yet that label may not really capture what makes Mattis a distinctive choice. Mattis has been sharply critical of Obama's policies on Iran, and Obama's capping of troop numbers and campaign   in theaters of war such as Afghanistan and Iraq. Mattis also appears to be a skeptic of the   policy of putting women into combat roles.  Mattis, 66, is a storied retired Marine general beloved by his troops whose skeptical views on Iran and appetite for a robust military that is unencumbered by political correctness align closely with those of his new boss. But Mattis is also a   who easily and unpretentiously quotes both the Roman stoic Marcus Aurelius and Eliot Cohen, the Republican military strategist who was a leader of the ”never Trump” movement. An American   general is likely to move around some two dozen times during the course of a long career. Typically, the general will move his family and household effects from one posting to the next. Mattis, who is unmarried, instead moved his books    all 7, 000 of them    many of which, he has since given away to libraries.   A student of warfare, In 2003 during the Iraq War, Mattis cited Alexander the Great when he explained in an email to a fellow officer why deep reading about the history of warfare can help to save American lives on the battlefield:  ”By reading, you learn through others' experience, generally a better way to do business, especially in our line of work where the consequences of incompetence are so final for young men.” Mattis may be nicknamed ”Mad Dog” because of his ferocity on the battlefield and his colorful aphorisms  —   ”Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet”    but not only is he an avid reader, he is also a deep thinker.  He   with General David Petraeus the 2006 counterinsurgency manual that helped to revolutionize the US approach to the Iraq War, emphasizing that fighting insurgents required    at least in the short term    assuming greater risks for American troops who had to get out of their massive bases and live among the Iraqi people if they were to have a chance of really understanding and ultimately defeating the Iraqi insurgency.  In August, Mattis published    together with military historian Kori Schake    an edited volume about American   relations, ”Warriors and Citizens,” that surely many folks at the Pentagon will be reading in coming weeks as they try to understand Mattis and where he will likely be driving ”the building,” as the Pentagon is known to its many inhabitants. His views on politics and war, In their concluding essay, in which Mattis and Schake variously quote the jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes the novelist Phil Klay founding father Samuel Adams and the Roman poet Juvenal, they make several key observations: First, since   American political leaders such as Presidents George W. Bush and Obama have deputized military leaders to make the political case for America's wars. Bush left it to General David Petraeus to make the case to Congress and the American people that the 2007 ”surge” of US troops into Iraq was turning the tide of the war. Obama, in Mattis' telling, ”has been mostly silent on the war in Afghanistan since 2009 the case for continuing American troop presence has been made entirely by the military.” Mattis clearly regards the policy of leaving it to military leaders to make the case for America's war as dangerous. Elected officials have a responsibility, according to Mattis, ”to win political arguments instead of depending on the military to do so.” Second, Mattis writes that the US is at a disadvantage because America's enemies are fighting ”total war” while the USA is fighting ”only limited wars.” Third, because of the current deference that the public and politicians have to the military and to veterans, the defense budget is getting dangerously skewed ”toward pay and benefits to the detriment of training, equipment and numbers in the force.” Mattis and Schake cite a statistic that in less than a decade, 80% of the US Army's spending could be devoted just to personnel costs.  Fourth, they are critical of using the military for the kind of social experimentation that undermines, in their view, military readiness: ”Public debates allowing open homosexuals to serve and opening combat assignments to women show civilian attitudes strongly at variance with the military (especially those serving in ground combat units where the atavistic nature of warfare is most pronounced. )”  Fifth, that an overemphasis on the casualties of war, and PTSD and military suicides among veterans has created a culture of ”victimization” around the military. Mattis and Schake say that Obama was more likely to visit Bethesda Naval Hospital to visit the wounded than to visit the massive army at Fort Hood, Texas, sending ”a cultural message that casualties are more important than what we are fighting for.” Sixth, that America's    wars in Afghanistan and Iraq ”lacked clear political objectives and carried   limitations such as troop caps, campaign   disconnected from conditions on the ground and restrictions on using ground troops at all (or that allowed them only in incremental numbers).” How he meshes with Trump, Overall, Mattis and Schake urge that political leaders such as Trump should be making the case for the necessity of America's wars rather than relying on the military to do so that those wars should be better resourced the USA should be in those wars to win, and the military should focus on waging successful wars rather than being a petri dish for social experimentation.  It's very much of a piece with Trump's ”America First” sloganeering, but Mattis lays out this thinking with much greater specificity than his new boss. Further clues about how Mattis may guide the Pentagon can be found in a thesis entitled ”The Mattis Way of War” written by Maj. Michael Valenti while he was a student at the US Army Staff College. The thesis examined how Mattis commanded what The Military Times describes as ”the deepest insertion of Marines into a combat zone in US history.” In the months after   Mattis led 1, 000 Marines who seized an abandoned airfield behind enemy lines in the heart of   Afghanistan in Kandahar province.  The thesis, which was published in September, also examines how  . Gen. Mattis led the First Marine division during the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The thesis makes a number of important observations about Mattis' leadership style.  First, Mattis tried to keep his staff as small as possible to increase the speed of his operations. Influenced by the work of leadership guru Jim Collins, he focuses ”on getting the right people on board” in his organization and ”getting the wrong people out.” Second, Mattis understands that history doesn't repeat itself, but ”it can lay the cognitive framework for innovative solutions to complex problems.” When Mattis designed the operation to insert the Marine force in Afghanistan, Mattis was informed by similar raids conducted during World War II and even the American Civil War in which troops were inserted behind enemy lines to ”destroy the enemy's security and shatter his will.”  Similarly, when Mattis prepared for the invasion of Iraq he ”mandated that every major and above in the division read Russell Braddon's 'The Siege,'” which was one of the only books ever written about fighting a war in Iraq. It chronicled the British fight there during World War I. Third, Mattis issued very clear ”commander's intent” guidelines so that all his Marines understood the purpose and goals of the fight they were embarking upon. Fourth, he pushed the responsibility for   during the battles he led down to the lowest levels possible. So what do Mattis' views and history as a military leader suggest about how he might help to shape policy in the Trump administration? A greater troop presence?  Clearly, an urgent priority will be what to do about Afghanistan where the Taliban now control or contest territory in which 10 million Afghans live and where ISIS has established a foothold. The Obama administration has signaled that US troops will eventually be pulling out of Afghanistan since as early as December 2009 when Obama first announced a surge of US troops into the country, but also announced their withdrawal date. Mattis clearly finds this deeply unsatisfactory and we can expect him to push for a more robust troop presence in Afghanistan unconstrained by arbitrary pullout deadlines. Similarly, Mattis is not a fan of Obama's incremental troop deployments in Iraq and Syria to defeat ISIS. Based on what he has said in the past, we should expect that he would push for whatever number of troops are needed to get the job done. Based on Mattis' comments about the role of women in combat, we might see a   Pentagon not placing women into combat roles in contrast to the present policy. In a speech in Washington in April, Mattis said that Iran is ”the single most enduring threat to stability and peace in the Middle East.” This view is shared by Trump's designated national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, and his nominee for CIA director, Rep. Mike Pompeo,  . We can expect this troika will push for tougher action on Iran, though Mattis is also on record as saying that there is ”no going back” on the Iran nuclear deal, which puts him out of step with some in Trump's inner circle. Already, Mattis seems to have influenced Trump to at least consider the idea that returning to an era when torture was employed by US officials is counterproductive.  If Mattis is confirmed as secretary of defense    which will require a congressional waiver since he recently retired as a military officer    he can be expected to argue for a robust military a deep commitment to America's wars a skepticism about putting women on the front lines, and an adherence to the Geneva Conventions when it comes to the treatment of captured American enemies."
40564,59433,Robby Mook: Trump benefited from Russia 'intervening in the election',CNN,Daniella Diaz,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Washington (CNN) Robby Mook, Clinton's former campaign manager, said that the US needs to investigate Russia ”intervening in the election.” He told CNN's Jake Tapper during a discussion Thursday at Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics that Russia is behind a lot of fake news on Facebook. ”I think (fake news) was a huge problem,” Mook said. ”I think there's a lot of things that we need to examine coming out of this. You just named one of them. Congress has got to investigate what happened with Russia here. We cannot have foreign, and foreign aggressors I would argue, intervening in our elections.” The full interview with Mook and Kellyanne Conway, campaign manager for Trump's successful presidential campaign, will air Sunday on CNN's ”State of the Union.”  Mook also blamed Breitbart News, which   Trump's senior adviser Steve Bannon used to run, for ”peddling stories” that are fake. Conway: 'The biggest piece of fake news' was idea Trump can't win, Bannon once referred to Breitbart News as ”the platform for the ” which critics say is rife with white nationalist,   and racist ideologies. ”And I'm not attacking (Bannon) personally, but they peddled a lot of stories on that website that are just false, they're just not true and that reinforced sexist, racist,   notions in people,” Mook said. ”You know, headlines that are shocking and insulting and shouldn't be part of our public discourse.” Conway countered the ”biggest piece of fake news in this election was that Trump couldn't win.” ”And that was peddled probably for weeks and months before the campaign definitely in the closing days,” she said. ”If you look at major newspapers and major cable station networks, Jake, it's unmistakable.” She continued, ”America said that there's a difference between what may offend me and what absolutely affects me.  And I, as a voter, am going to go that way and I'm going to vote according to what absolutely affects me.”"
40565,59434,Howard Dean drops out of DNC chair race,CNN,Daniella Diaz,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Washington (CNN) Howard Dean has dropped his bid for a second stint chairing the Democratic National Committee, citing ”other priorities” and a ”possibly divisive” race. ”I'm not going to be a candidate for the DNC chairmanship,” the former Vermont governor and 2004 presidential candidate said at the start of an Association of State Democratic Chairs forum in Denver. ”I think it could possibly be divisive. I have other priorities. I have a grandchild now. But I am fully dedicated to using as much time as I can to support whoever the chairman is.” A leading contender for the spot is Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, who is still in the running for the position despite criticism over his past ties to the Nation of Islam and his defense of its leader, Louis Farrakhan, resurfacing in the news this week. Ellison distanced himself from the group during his first congressional run a decade ago.  Dean served as the governor of Vermont from 1991 to 2003 and gained a national following during his bid for 2004 Democratic nomination by drawing support online    a fairly novel concept at the time    which came up short. Dean then in early 2005 won a spirited contest to chair the DNC. During his tenure Democrats won control of the House in 2006, and Obama won the presidency two years later.  Dean earlier this month threw his hat in the ring for the reprise of that role, and was expected to be among Ellison's most formidable challengers. ”The dems need organization and focus on the young,” Dean tweeted earlier this month, proposing to renew the strategy. ”Need a fifty State strategy and tech rehab. I am in for chairman again.” The current head of the DNC is Donna Brazile, a longtime Democratic operative and former CNN contributor, who is leading in an interim capacity after Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned on the eve of the party's convention last summer. Hacked emails appeared to show Wasserman Schultz and other   DNC officials discussing ways to undermine Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' efforts against Clinton in the primary. Dean said late Friday afternoon he came to his decision ”two or three weeks ago. Once I was in, I got a quick lay of the land. I think that I would have and could have won just with what we were able to accomplish last time I was chair,” Dean told MSNBC on Friday. Dean also sized up current rivals to Ellison for the party leadership. He called Jaime Harrison, chair of the South Carolina Democrats, a ”good candidate” and New Hampshire Democrats Chair Ray Buckley ”very experienced.” ”I may make an endorsement down the line,” Dean said."
40566,59435,The heartwarming tale of a parrot and a mugshot,CNN,,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,," (CNN) So yeah, this is a mugshot of a guy with a parrot on his shoulder. But there's more to this photo than meets the eye. So let's start at the beginning . .. Craig Buckner, an Oregon resident, went to court Monday for violating a release order. He'd failed to appear in court on drug and theft charges, the Washington County Sheriff's Office said. His companion parrot, Bird, came along with him.  Thinking the judge would only slap him with a fine, Buckner left (the very  ) Bird on a tree outside the courthouse and went in.  But the judge ruled differently: he ordered Buckner taken into custody immediately.  Never mind going to jail, Buckner was worried about his Bird. And Bird, apparently, was getting worried too. According to CNN affiliate KPTV, she was surrounded by crows outside and was pretty distressed.  Seeing how distraught Buckner was about deserting Bird, Deputy Shoana McKelvey made some calls to arrange a friend to pick her up. ”Mr. Buckner was already in a stressful position and did not need the additional stress and worry of his loved pet, Bird.” McKelvey said. The deputies also went and brought Bird in and let the macaw hang out with its owner in the booking area.  ”Our sheriff's office has very strong core values of doing the right thing. I also have very strong moral values of treating all people with compassion no matter what role I am taking,” McKelvey said. And that's how Buckner and his feathery friend ended up in this amazing mugshot. Because some officers decided to extend a little kindness."
40567,59436,Democrats want Russian hacking intelligence declassified,CNN,Manu Raju,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Washington (CNN) Democratic senators are pressing the Obama administration to more forthrightly state, based in part on new intelligence information, that Russia's meddling in the US election was intended to help Trump, multiple sources tell CNN. Multiple sources with knowledge of the investigation into Russia's hacking say the US intelligence community is increasingly confident that Russian meddling in the US election was intended to steer the election toward Trump, rather than simply to undermine or in other ways disrupt the political process. The sources say there is some new information but would not specify due to the classified nature of the intelligence.   Despite the Democratic pressure, the sources say that they do not see the new information as significantly changing the intelligence agencies' understanding of what Russia was intending to do since the targets of the hack were known to be the democratic party.  There is no indication the intelligence community is planning to update its October 7 public statement from the Director of National Intelligence that laid out publicly the US intelligence community's view regarding Russian cyber activities. The reality behind Russia's fake news, In that statement, intelligence community blamed Russia for the hacks and said the ”thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process.” However, the intelligence community has never publicly said that Russia's intention was to help Trump over his Democratic opponent Clinton. The call to release the information came in a short letter to the president released by seven Democratic senators that said ”there is additional information concerning the Russian Government and the U. S. election” and called for the details to be declassified and released to the public. The public letter was signed by all the Democrats on the Senate intelligence community except the ranking member, Sen. Dianne Feinstein. Feinstein did sign the second, classified message sent conveying more information about the request. A Trump ally dismissed the new push by the Democrats. ”This is nothing more than sour grapes from partisan Democrats upset that Clinton lost.” ”I don't consider this a partisan issue,” said Sen. Angus King, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who signed the letter. ”We can't just let it go and say that's history because they will keep doing it.”  Putin: Trump agrees   relations 'must be straightened out' At a hearing last month, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper did not address why the Russians interfered but did say he saw no reason Russian efforts would stop now that Trump has been elected. ”I don't anticipate a significant change in Russian behavior, Clapper said in the November 17th hearing. ”Russians have a very active and aggressive capability to conduct information operations, so called hybrid warfare. That's been a long standing practice of theirs going back to the Soviet era and I anticipate that it will continue.” During the election, Democrats have been frustrated that the intelligence community did not go as far as to say the meddling was intended to benefit Trump, noting all of the hacking was directed at Democratic operatives    the Democratic National Committee and top Clinton campaign official John Podesta. Emails from those intrusions were posted online. ”The Russians were not seeking alone to sow discord into our democratic process by their hacking and dumping prior to the election they were also seeking to damage Secretary Clinton, and in so doing, assist their preferred candidate, Trump,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, a democrat on the House intelligence committee. ”To  conclude otherwise, you would have to be oblivious to the   nature of their release of damaging internal emails, or consider the Russians unmindful of what they were doing.” Russia's president called the US accusations ”myths” in his address to Russia's parliament on Thursday.  Trump's first 100 days: A breakdown of his plan, On Friday Republican lawmakers downplayed the letter, telling CNN there was no new information to suggest the intelligence community has changed its assessment in any way. One senior Republican who is on the intelligence committee and sits in on classified briefings for Congress said there is not information to advance the narrative regarding why Russia interfered.  Rep. Mike McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security committee said Friday he's ”seen no evidence” that the intelligence assessment is changing. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Friday the president has the power to declassify the information ”by just saying it.” Pelosi, who as the top Democrat in the House is privy to some of the country's most classified information, said she had not seen the letter but agreed that more information should be put out. ”Russians hacked our committees.  Everyday emails came out from the Democratic side,” Pelosi noted. ”I think there should be more information known to the American people, whether that's by declassification,” Pelosi said.   Trump has long been doubtful about the claims of Russian involvement. ”It could be Russia, but it could also be China, it could also be lots of other people,” Trump said at the first presidential debate.

40568,59437,Austria's far-right: Hipsters or hatemongers?,CNN,Atika Shubert,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Vienna, Austria (CNN) At the stroke of midnight in Vienna city center, members of Austria's   Identity Movement slipped on   vests and boarded a crane to pull off an audacious political prank: Draping a huge black cloth resembling a giant niqab    the Islamic face veil    onto a    statue of the Habsburg ruler, Empress Maria Theresa.    In case their political motivations were in any doubt, they also tacked up a sign that read ”Islamization. No thank you!” and signed it with the symbol of the Identity Movement.   Vienna police were less than amused to wake up to the sight of a national monument draped in such a provocative political protest    but no one has been arrested for the stunt.  Martin Sellner, however, was pleased: ”We try to teach patriots in Europe methods of   action. That's our main principle. No violence. No real hate speech.”     A      graphic designer, wearing   glasses and   shirts advertising Identity Movement slogans such as ”Europa Nostra”    ”Our Europe”    Sellner has been called the ”hipster” of the  .  ”We see ourselves as patriots, not ” he says. ”We don't hate immigrants. But we also don't want to see the country change and end up minorities in our countries. We wanted to express this opinion without   without the racism of the old right.” It is a carefully cultivated image: a sunny veneer masking a political ideology centered on a white Christian identity which rejects immigration and globalization. READ MORE: What does the   do now? Influx of refugees, ”My generation was never asked if we want this mass immigration, this Islamization and population replacement in this country,” he explains over several cups of Viennese coffee. ”We were born into a society that believes we are racist for simply saying that we are becoming a minority in our own country.”  In a series of posts on YouTube, Sellner suggests white Christians are on the verge of ”extinction,” increasingly marginalized by growing numbers of migrants in what he calls the ”Great Replacement.” ”My biggest fear is that at some point demographics could kill democracy,” he says, ”that our society by mass immigration becomes such an ethnically fragmented society that a real democracy is not possible anymore because there is no common ground of values, history and identity.” But that fear isn't supported by the numbers.  While an estimated 15% of Austria's population are foreign citizens, approximately half of those come from within the EU. For Sellner,   migration    white and Christian    is acceptable.   residents in Austria are outnumbered 10 to one.  Still, Sellner is not alone: Worries about migration reached fever pitch last year when more than a million asylum seekers crossed into Europe, at least 700, 000 of them via Austria.  Many were from Syria and Afghanistan, and while most were simply passing through on their way to Germany, Sweden and elsewhere, an estimated 90, 000 opted to stay and claim asylum in Austria.  READ MORE: Can Europe survive the Trump effect? Surge in   support, The Austrian government responded by erecting border fences, decreeing that only 3, 200 migrants would be allowed to enter the country each day, and capping resettlement claims to 80 a day until an annual limit of 37, 500 was reached.  Across Europe, the tide of new arrivals has prompted waves of   sentiment   parties such as France's National Front and Austria's Freedom Party are seeing a surge in support. Sellner is a big fan of US   Trump, whom he calls ”God Emperor.” He hopes Trump's election victory    on a platform that included plans to build a wall along the Mexican border and a ban on Muslim immigrants    will further inspire the   across the continent.  The Identity Movement began in France, but has since spread to Austria, Denmark and Germany. It appeals to a younger generation seeking to distance itself from the openly racist, xenophobic   parties of the past.  Sellner insists that the movement is not racist but ” ”    it doesn't believe that white Christian culture is superior, he says, but that globalization is forcing countries to adopt a multiculturalism that destroys the ethnic and cultural values of individual states.  ”We are not fighting against diversity. We don't think that people need to be racially pure,” he says, adding that the group rejects ”  or (anything) that identifies the problem with a certain people.” READ MORE: Holocaust survivor: Don't let   win, 'Crazy ideologies' Yet the Identity Movement does single out one group: Muslims. Only an estimated 7% of Austrians are Muslim. But in Vienna and its suburbs    where Sellner grew up    Muslims make up more than 12% of the population, and some neighborhoods are majority Muslim.  Sellner claims this is ”Islamization” and that the Muslim religion is incompatible with Austrian values    but even he admits Islam has a long history in Vienna. ”After all,” he says, gesturing to the mirrored salon of the Viennese cafe we are talking in. ”We are drinking coffee brought by the Turks!”  Given Europe's history, its   slide into fascism, the great wars that killed millions and singled out Jews and other minorities for genocide, isn't Sellner worried that the Identity Movement may be one step on a slippery slope to repeating that dark past?   No, he says: ”I feel a kind of fatherly responsibility for young Austrian patriots not to let them go into these extreme subcultures that are driven by hate and crazy ideologies.” Instead he claims, perhaps counterintuitively, ”I think the entire movement is the strongest force against   extremism in Austria.” It's difficult to know just how many support the Identity Movement, but Sellner hopes     candidate Norbert Hofer will be voted into power in Sunday's presidential election.   READ MORE: Who is Austria's Norbert Hofer? And while that may not change Austrian policy immediately    the Austrian president's role is largely ceremonial    it would be proof of what Sellner believes is a ”silent majority” in the country who share his beliefs.   ”The main idea of equality and opportunity is great. No one would object to that. But the problem is egalitarianism. People are different. We look different. We have different cultures, languages and traditions. Politics and policies need to reflect that,” he says.  ”I think every society has only a certain capacity for integration. I think we have gone far beyond that capacity in Europe.”"

They had been leaving each other notes on a desk, neither knowing the identity of their mysterious pen pal. But the   encounter was cut short when a single gunman appeared behind them at the school's gym entrance.   In a chilling new public service announcement, Sandy Hook Promise    the gun violence prevention group led by families of those killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School    conveys a powerful message, concealing and then revealing signs that may lead to gun violence. While we watch Evan's story, a darker tale is unfolding in the background: the evolution of a school shooter. But unless you're watching closely, you'll miss it. And that's kind of the point of the PSA. ”We wanted to create an impactful visual to show that violence is preventable if you know the signs. Many people are unaware of that there are specific signs that people give off that can indicate a violent act is imminent,” said Nicole Hockley,   and managing director of Sandy Hook Promise. Her   son, Dylan, died in the Sandy Hook massacre. ”These acts are preventable when you know the signs. Everyone has the power to intervene and get help. These actions can save lives.” Hockley said the organization timed the release to the holiday season, when violence spikes.  ”We saw that over the Thanksgiving holiday in Chicago, when 70 people were shot, nine of them fatally. We know that people will be spending a lot of time with their families in the coming weeks, and we thought this could inspire them to have important conversations about how to prevent violence together,” she said. ”We want this video to inspire hope in those who watch it, to show them that we are not helpless in the face of gun violence and that there is something all of us can do to prevent it,” Hockley added.  Stephen Teret, founding director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said the video is powerful and ”extraordinarily well done. It just flipped my stomach at the end.  ”I'd like to see the   message to be, we need a prevention policy in addition to the students, parents and teachers spotting a student creating havoc.  Teret added, however, that ”policy is difficult to make in this area.” On December 14, 2012, Adam Lanza killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in one of the worst mass shootings in US history. Lanza also killed his mother at their home.  The families of nine of the Sandy Hook victims filed a lawsuit against the gun manufacture, but it was dismissed. On Thursday, the Connecticut Supreme Court said it will hear an appeal from the families."
40570,59439,EPA boss: Room for hope on climate change,CNN,John D. Sutter,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,," (CNN) If you're concerned about climate change, you're likely in full panic mode right now.  Consider three recent news items:  • US   Trump has called climate change a ”hoax” and has suggested he might scrap many   environmental regulations, including the landmark Paris Agreement, which aims to limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius. • The head of Trump's EPA transition team is basically a fossil fuel industry mouthpiece.   • And, thanks partly to our addiction to fossil fuels, this year is expected to be the hottest on record    again. That has real consequences all around the world, from Louisiana, where floods linked to   warming killed 13 people to India, where farmers were committing suicide amid searing drought Canada, where wildfires evacuated a city and Alaska, where the indigenous village of Shishmaref voted to relocate because the coast is melting.  Climate change is happening now. We're causing it. And frankly, it's terrifying.  But    and this is a critical ”but”    there's still room for hope.  That's the message I took from an interview Friday with the outgoing head of the EPA, Gina McCarthy, who has been fighting climate change for the Obama administration.  ”Whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, you're going to care about the future for your kids,” she told me. ”Our clean energy train has left the station and it is filled with very happy people.  ”I'm pretty confident that we'll be fine.” This from a woman who may be replaced with a climate change skeptic. I asked McCarthy a number of questions you sent in via Facebook and CNN's Two Degrees newsletter. Many of you wanted to know how rapidly she expects Trump to shred   climate goals.  Those laws    including the Paris Agreement, the international treaty to slow warming, and the Clean Power Plan, which aimed to limit pollution from coal power    may not matter as much as you think, McCarthy said, since markets already are heading toward wind and solar and away from dirtier energy. ”I don't think that anyone could think that getting rid of the (Clean Power Plan) or not joining the Paris Agreement (the US already joined it, actually, as have 114 others) is somehow going to change anything in the US,” she said. ”Investments are set. Five times as much investment in clean energy as there is in the rest of the economy.” ”The private sector is demanding it, businesses are demanding it,” she added.  ”I think 2. 5 million people depend on it for their jobs.”  Another ray of hope: Young people really care about this.  I relayed your questions about a federal court case in Oregon in which 21 young people are suing the federal government    including McCarthy    over relative inaction on climate change. The symbolism of the case is awesome: The kids argue on constitutional grounds that the government is failing to protect their right to property (one young plaintiff lives on the Florida coast, which is disappearing) and a livable future. Basically, they think young people are being discriminated against when it comes to climate. They have the most to lose    since they'll live the longest, and see the most warming    yet they can't vote. Advocates and attorneys for the kids want the Obama administration to settle the case now, before Trump takes office. They say the courts could force the Trump administration to curb   pollution.  A settlement is unlikely, McCarthy told me.  But she is encouraged young people are speaking up (even though she's named in the suit).  ”Their voices need to be heard,” she said. ”It's about their future.”  ”States can take action. Local communities can take action,” she said. ”People should not go back into their corners or be shy. And there's no closet big enough to hold everybody who reads the climate science and understands it. We will still be able to make progress    (but) it may not be at the federal level.” To win on climate, Trump needs to see the business case, she said.  And realize the US could fall behind in the modern economy without action.  ”Are we going to be leading the worldwide effort or ceding that to another country, in particular China? Is that where we want to be?” she said. ”Or do we want to be in a leadership position where we're making the jobs, we're doing the innovation, we're doing the investing, and frankly we're standing up and doing what the science tells us we have to do.” The science, by the way, tells us we need to ditch fossil fuels    almost completely    this century. That's to have any reasonable shot of limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius above   levels, the threshold world leaders have agreed is the absolute red line for climate change.  It's a harsh reality.  But, as climate activists are fond of saying, the Earth's math doesn't change because of politics.  We've already warmed the planet about 1 degree Celsius.  ”I'm hoping that this next administration will not have blinders on,” McCarthy said. The same could be said of the public."
40571,59440,'Mariah's World' lives down to expectations on E!,CNN,,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,," (CNN) To say that ”Mariah's World” is a predictable train wreck serves more as promotion than criticism. Yet even by the standards of reality   this E! showcase for pop diva Mariah Carey is pretty hilarious, especially with everything that's transpired since the point where the show's storytelling begins. Those who watch such fare for the kitsch factor will have plenty in which to wallow, as Carey conducts most of her    interviews provocatively draped across a couch, looking a bit like Cleopatra being ferried across the Nile. She also appears near the outset (after a segment that basically summarizes the whole series in two minutes) as a character named ”Bianca Storm,” wearing a wig and affecting a British ( ) accent. Carey is shown cavorting on a yacht in Capri, Italy, and fretting about agreeing to do the show at all, citing how ”little privacy” there is in entertainment. One might ask why she would then agree to the prying eyes of cameras    including footage of her young children    but if there's one guiding rule for E! and Bravo shows (sister networks that will simulcast the premiere) it's perhaps best not to overthink them. The drama, such as it is, centers on the collision between Carey's personal and professional lives, as she prepares for a European concert tour while planning her wedding to Australian billionaire James Packer. The two have since split up, which should foster some suspense about how much if any of that will be reflected over the   run. (Conflicting reports have suggested his presence in the show might be edited.) In the interim, ”Mariah's World” falls back on conventional   strategies, with the usual tension and chaos that surrounds balancing the singer's various commitments. There's also a supporting cast, for lack of a better term, that includes her   manager, Stella Bulochnikov, who tartly tells a candidate interviewing to be Mariah's personal assistant that she's not allowed to either date or cry. Others in the ensemble include Carey's nephew, Shawn McDonald, and her backup dancers, who gripe at one point about wearing outfits that will make it hard for them to move. The only tougher job here, frankly, might be the show's editors, who, given how much the narrative jumps around, are deserving of combat pay. ”'Mariah's World' is a fantasy many wish was their reality,” E! says in its press release. There's probably more fantasy    and certainly playing to a Carey's   image    than reality in ”Mariah's World.” But the artifice and choreography don't prevent the show from being just the sort of oddity that should keep fans coming back for more. ”Mariah's World” premieres December 4 at 9 p. m. on E! and Bravo."
40572,59441,Iraq death toll climbs in grinding battle for Mosul,CNN,Salma Abdelaziz,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Irbil, Iraq (CNN) Nearly 2, 000 Iraqi troops were killed across Iraq in November as they battled to force ISIS extremists from the country, according to newly released UN figures. That's nearly triple the number of military casualties reported in October, when an offensive to retake the city of Mosul from ISIS first began.  The toll for November includes Iraqi army, police in combat, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and allied militias.  The   coalition forces' advance slowed after Iraqi Security Forces entered Mosul last month, a densely populated urban environment where troops have had to fight    battles against deeply entrenched militants.  Civilians in the city also are paying a heavy price. Mosul residents were encouraged by the central government in Baghdad to stay in their homes, forcing a softening of tactics to prevent civilian casualties. The policy, which is meant to avert the potential humanitarian crisis that could be created by a mass exodus, could itself be costing lives.  ”In its desperate attempt to cling on to territory it controls in Mosul and Ninevah areas, Daesh has been employing the most vicious tactics, using civilian homes as firing positions as well as abducting and forcibly moving civilians, effectively using them as human shields,” the UN  's special representative for Iraq, Ján Kubiš, said in a statement. Daesh is an alternative name for ISIS. More than 900 civilians were killed and another 930 wounded in November by terrorism, violence or armed conflict across Iraq, according to the UN report released Thursday. Another 76, 000 people have been displaced by the fighting, according to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. And at least half a million people caught in the crossfire inside Mosul now have no access to running water, the United Nations told CNN on Wednesday. ISIS' toxic legacy: Iraqis battle blazing oil wells,  Preparing to converge on Mosul, Iraqi forces have entirely surrounded Mosul and now, 45 days into the battle, their focus is on consolidating recent gains before pressing forward with the offensive.  Seven axes of coalition forces are approaching Mosul from different sides. Some fronts are holding their position while other fronts catch up, to allow the nearly 100, 000 troops to converge more or less simultaneously on the city, military officials told CNN. They face many obstacles. Some 632 ISIS car bombs, some guided by drones, have been used to attack Iraqi troops, according to Iraq's Joint Operations Command. ISIS has also used booby traps, homemade bombs and snipers to slow the sweeping gains made by Iraqi forces in the open fields surrounding Mosul into grinding urban warfare.  Iraqi commander: Morale is high, The grueling    battles are expected to take months and cost hundreds, if not thousands, of lives, but commanders say they are up to the challenge.  ”The morale of Iraqi Security Forces is high, we will continue fighting those terrorists to the end until we liberate Mosul from ISIS dirt,” counter terrorism Lt. Gen. Abdulwahab al Saidi told CNN on Friday from Mosul. A sliver of 23 neighborhoods on Mosul's eastern side has been recaptured but Iraqi forces must still wrest many more areas from ISIS' control before troops reach the Tigris River, which divides the city.  Mosul's western side is more heavily populated, with smaller streets and older infrastructure, making it an even more difficult battlefield. To the south, Iraqi federal police have reached the outskirts of the city and are awaiting orders to storm the strategic al Ghazlani military base and Mosul airport, according to a statement from the police.  Fear of retribution, About 70 kilometers (43 miles) west of Mosul, a battle to recapture the   city of Tal Afar has reignited simmering sectarian tensions.  The   Popular Mobilization Units have taken 130 towns and villages and the Tal Afar air base, and are now fighting to clear and secure the area.  With the Shiite militia on the doorstep of Tal Afar, its 50, 000 predominantly Sunni residents say they fear retribution attacks. Human rights groups have accused the Popular Mobilization Units of extrajudicial killings, torture, and other abuses against the local Sunni population in recent months.  In October, Prime Minister Haider   promised that the PMU would not enter Tal Afar, but recent statements by officials have made the matter unclear and opened the door for possible involvement. Defensive line, To the north of Mosul, the Iraqi army is clashing with ISIS militants near the town of Tal Kayf, the terror group's last stronghold before reaching the northern outskirts of Mosul.  According to Iraq's Joint Operation Command, 23 car bombs have been destroyed by   air support and an area of about 100 square kilometers has been liberated in an operation that began November 1.  Northeast of Mosul, the Peshmerga are holding a defensive line against ISIS. The Kurdish fighters will not have a role in retaking Mosul itself, but have been fighting back the terror group in northern Iraq for two years.  The prolonged battle has cost 1, 600 Peshmerga lives, spokesman Brig. Gen. Halgurd Hikmat told CNN. Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the number of Peshmerga killed in the battle for Mosul. There have been 1, 600 Peshmerga deaths."

In the poster, Peter Griffin was seen with   skin and a tagline that read: ”As long as we're voting for dumb loudmouths, can I get an Emmy?” ”Most of us love America a hell of a lot and we don't want America to be conned the way many of us have ourselves,” MacFarlane added. ”Trump is not of the People.

Before they used to go to gardens and be in the streets.” UNICEF estimates that some 100, 000 children are living under siege in eastern Aleppo alone. According to the intergovernmental organization, volunteers in besieged areas have built underground play areas and schools for children hoping to continue playing and learning amid airstrikes. Mahmoud last heard from his brother three days ago, just before he was killed. Anas sent him an audio message on instant messaging service WhatsApp, saying how crazy the situation was in Aleppo. Mahmoud says he could hear the rumble of jets and the sound of an explosion in the background. ”All I could say was good luck,” Mahmoud said.

The firefighter and paramedic  was working with the Sevier County Ambulance Service that day and could see all the smoke in the air. ”We knew Gatlinburg was on fire, but we didn't know the extent of it,” he said. He found out when he got his first call in the city, where traffic was bumper to bumper on the main road as people tried to escape the flames all around them.  ”It literally looked like hell on Earth,” he said. That was when he started to worry.   At 10 pm, Thompson responded to a 911 call that took him by his house, which was still standing.   Three hours later, he was rushing to another emergency call and again passed his home.  ”My heart sunk,” said the trained firefighter, who had to watch as flames engulfed the house.  ”There was nothing I could do because I was responding to a 911 call,” he said. Thompson knows firefighters like himself have done everything they could to fight the flames and save the structures these past few days. But the wind has been so strong, it's made the fire jump around.  ”We gave it our all, it just overwhelmed,” he said. On Thursday, Thompson and his wife finally saw what was left of their home and were heartbroken when they realized that they had lost everything. The structure had collapsed on itself.  ”We salvaged about three of our daughter's Precious Moments figurines,” he said. ”Everything else was ashes.” The Thompsons vow not to let the loss nor the fires destroy their spirit, because they know many people, including Peter's parents, also lost their homes and are temporarily displaced.  ”We're going to rebuild.

40627,59496,Austrian presidential election: Who is Norbert Hofer,CNN,,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,," (CNN) He's the smiling,   presidential candidate who was hoping to sweep into power in Sunday's Austrian election. But Freedom Party candidate Norbert Hofer has instead conceded defeat after exit polls showed an apparent win for his rival, Green Party candidate Alexander Van der Bellen. Voters seemingly turned their backs on Hofer, who would have been the first   president in Western Europe since the end of World War II. Exit polls announced by state broadcaster ORF showed Van der Bellen with 53. 6% of the vote, though official results are not expected until late Sunday or early Monday. It marks a significant increase for Van der Bellen, who narrowly defeated Hofer by some 30, 000 votes during the original election in May. Those election results were later annulled following concerns over how some postal ballots were handled. The smiling face of the far right?   In recent months Hofer seemingly swapped his earlier   strongman persona for that of a gentler,   character. The    former aeronautical engineer portrayed himself as the kindly face of the   according to Oliver Rathkolb, professor of contemporary history at the University of Vienna.  ”Hofer's message is: 'I'm strong but you don't have to fear me,'” Rathkolb told CNN.  Over the course of the unprecedentedly long presidential campaign, Hofer's public persona shifted from a   hardliner to the    survivor of a 2003 paragliding accident. ”In the first, and partly in the second round of televised debates, Hofer showed another face when he very aggressively attacked Van Der Bellen on policies,” explained Rathkolb. ”But obviously this was not so successful, and in the third round he decided to be smiling and nice, which is how the general audience in Austria sees him.” What did he stand for?  : ”  and the fear of Islamic terrorism have been Hofer's key messages,” said Rathkolb. ”He wants a very small of flow of migration and refugees,” Rathkolb continued. ”And where he is most outspoken is against Muslims who he says are bringing political Islam into Austria.”  : Early in the campaign Hofer indicated support for a referendum on Austria's membership in the EU, but he recently changed his tune. ”Hofer is not interested in a   referendum on Austria leaving the EU,” said Rathkolb. ”That's because he knows from the polls that Austrians are not interested in following the British example.”  : ”Hofer is not only against Turkey joining the EU, but also against Turks coming to Austria,” said Rathkolb. ”His references to Turkish passport blocks should be seen as part of a larger Freedom Party campaign against Turks and Muslims    especially in the wake of large numbers of Syrian refugees traveling through Turkey in their attempt to reach Europe,” he added.  What cost him the election? It's too early to tell what motivated voters, but Rathkolb believed mixed messages from Hofer could ultimately cost him the presidency. ”If he's not elected it's because he changed his first round political appearance    showing himself as a tough man carrying a Glock pistol, and right now retreating on many issues,” he said. ”Trying to get votes from the middle and being as calm as possible may mean he struggles to mobilize his voters for a third time.”"

Pat Rafter, a   Wimbledon finalist, also backed his compatriot to one day win the grass court grand slam. ”I know that   he's as good as I have seen in the last 20 years,” the twice US Open champion told CNN's Open Court. ”He can be No. 1 in my mind.” Rafter    who retired in 2002 before a brief comeback in 2014    admits, however, that the unpredictable Kyrgios needs to combine a disciplined lifestyle with mental toughness if he is to make good on his potential. ”He's a real mystery to me at the moment,” said Rafter, who last week took part in the Champion's Tennis tournament at London's Royal Albert Hall. ”I don't know how he's coping with things mentally.” ”He's got the potential, we all know that, but is he training  hard? Is he doing all the right things? Is he mentally prepared? I can't answer those questions. I don't know how he's going to go.”  While there has never been any doubt about Kyrgios' natural talent, Rafter questions whether the volatile Aussie is capable of withstanding the physical demands of the Tour. ”I think   Nick can do it. I don't know about physically you have to be an   good athlete as well. Can he back up seven matches (the number of consecutive wins it takes to earn a grand slam title)?” Rafter asked.

Operating without a   coach is rare for a player of Kyrgios' stature, although Roger Federer also operated without a coach for a significant part of his career. His lack of focus was palpable at Wimbledon in July when he faced his friend Andy Murray in the fourth round.

Kyrgios committed a slew of unforced errors    some a result of unnecessary trick shots    and didn't even bother to sit down during a crucial changeover. Eventual Wimbledon champion Murray won easily to go up   in their    record. ”I think when things get tough, I'm just a little bit soft,” Kyrgios admitted after the match    before getting to the heart of what has been troubling his career. ”I don't love the sport. But, you know, I don't really know what else to do without it.” Instead, Kyrgios has spoken of his love of basketball, and his wish to retire from tennis at the age 27 to pursue hoops professionally in Europe.  That leaves just six years for him to fulfill his tennis potential. Can he do it? "

(AP)  —   The tedious task of recounting Wisconsin's   nearly 3 million votes for president began Thursday with scores   of hastily hired temporary workers flipping through stacks of   ballots as observers watched their every move. ” '   The action in Wisconsin could soon be duplicated   in  and Pennsylvania, where Green   Party presidential candidate Jill Stein was pushing for recounts. ' '   Donald  narrowly beat Clinton   in all three states, but recounts were not expected to flip   nearly enough votes to change the outcome in any of the states. ' '   The Wisconsin recount marked the first time in 16 years there was   a   recount of a presidential recount. But it does   not carry the same drama as the Florida presidential recount of   2000, when the outcome of the election between Al Gore and George   W. Bush hung in the balance. ' '   ”This is certainly not Bush v. Gore,” said Wisconsin''s chief   elections administrator, Mike Haas. ' '' ”   Even so, the campaigns for  Clinton and   Stein all had observers spread throughout the state to watch the   process. The recount will have to move quickly. The federal   deadline to certify the vote to avoid having the fate of   Wisconsin's 10 electoral votes decided by Congress is Dec. 13.   Even if that were to happen, the votes would almost certainly go   to  since Republicans control both   chambers of Congress. ” ”   Most counties will manually recount the ballots, although Stein   lost a court challenge this week to force hand recounts   everywhere. The state's largest county, Milwaukee, was recounting   the ballots by feeding them through the same machines that   counted them on election night. In Dane County, where Clinton won   71 percent of the vote, the ballots were being counted by hand. ” ”   Workers in Dane County are being paid $20 an hour and will work   two shifts over about 12 hours a day to get the recount done by   the deadline, said County Clerk Scott McDonell. He didn't expect   much change in the results. ” '   ”I think we will be very close to what was reported on election   night,” McDonell said Thursday. ' '   Clinton lost to  by about 22, 000   votes in Wisconsin, or less than a percentage point. ' '   Stein has argued, without evidence, that irregularities in the   votes in all three states suggest that there could have been   tampering with the vote, perhaps through a     highly complex cyberattack. ' '   ”Verifying the vote through this recount is the only way to   confirm that every vote has been counted securely and accurately   and is not compromised by machine or human error, or by tampering   or hacking,” Stein said in a statement Thursday. ' ”   Stein's critics, including the Wisconsin Republicans,   contend that she is a   candidate who is merely trying   to raise her profile while raising millions of dollars. Stein has   taken in nearly $7 million for the recounts, which is about twice   as much as her longshot presidential campaign took in. ” '   The Wisconsin recount was estimated to cost about $3. 9 million.   Stein paid $973, 250 for the requested recount   in . ' ' on Thursday objected to a recount   of  presidential votes, at least   delaying the planned Friday start of the recount there until next   week. ' '   The Board of State Canvassers will meet Friday to hear arguments.   The  Bureau of Elections said the   recount cannot proceed until two business days after the     bipartisan board resolves the objection. ' ' attorneys said Stein, who finished   fourth in  is not ”aggrieved” by any   alleged election fraud or mistake, that a recount could not be   finished on time and that her petition was not properly signed.   They said Stein is asking for an expensive,     recount ”on the basis of nothing more than speculation.” ' '   Stein countered that  ”cynical   efforts to delay the recount and create unnecessary costs for   taxpayers are shameful and outrageous.” ' ”   In Pennsylvania, a hearing is scheduled for Monday on Stein's   push to secure a   statewide recount, a legal   maneuver that has never been tried, according to one of the   lawyers who filed it. ” ”   Stein's attorneys want a forensic analysis of electronic voting   machines in Pennsylvania to see if there any evidence that their   software was hacked. But counties where Green   voters   have sought a recount are refusing to do such forensic   examinations. ”"

For those within Italy the vote has become a   referendum on Renzi and as Italians grow increasingly frustrated   that their lives haven't materially improved, even some members   of Congress from within Renzi's own party who originally voted   for the referendum are now scrambling to develop compelling   arguments for why they now oppose it.

In Dell's case, you can  for $629. That's too much.' 'There are two clouds hanging over all this.' 'The simple one is that CES is next month. With Android apps mostly on the horizon, it wouldn't be a shock to see a wave of flexible, touchscreen Chromebooks pop up. Whether those will be any good, who knows; Chromebooks' growth is still coming  more than the general public, so the price hike that comes with adding a touchscreen may not be worth it.' 'The second cloud hanging over Chromebooks is Andromeda, the  of Chrome OS and Android.  that Google is working on a   “Pixel 3” laptop that will run that blended operating system, arrive in Q3 2017, and start at $799. That's a lot of money, but if Google is about to combine Chrome OS and Android, rather than shove the latter into the former, that might explain why the current Chromebook market is so underwhelming.' ”All of that is for the future, though. Today, in the thick of the holiday season, it's hard to point to any one Chromebook and confidently say, “put your money toward this. ” You can get something good, but it's hard to get something great.”"

' ”   The    Denver Broncos linebacker and reigning Super Bowl   MVP currently leads the NFL in sacks (12. 5) and in 90 career   games he's logged 85 sacks.  Miller right now   tops the league in quarterback pressures (with 60) and is   graded as a   edge rusher. ” ”   By just about every metric, Miller is the best defensive player   in football (sorry, JJ Watt).

And so long as Miller is anchoring the Broncos defense, the team   will be a threat to anyone in the league.  ” ”   Off the field, meanwhile, Miller seems to have swiftly taken   over for former teammate Peyton Manning as the most   marketable player not just in football, but perhaps in all of   sports. If you have turned on your TV this year, you have no   doubt caught a glimpse of a bespectacled Miller, grinning   for one reason or another. Here he is in an Old Spice commercial,   there he is rocking Beats By Dre.

He was always supremely   talented on the field  —   the no. 2 pick in the 2011 Draft, with 30   sacks in his first two years  —   but issues off the field   threatened to put his career in jeopardy. He was suspended four   games for violating the league's substance abuse policy, and   around the same time  after failing to appear in court for a prior   traffic violation. ” '   Looking back on it today, Miller said during these lower   moments he realized that his opportunity in the NFL was too big     —   and too short  —   to squander.  ' '   ” ' '  ' '  ' '   ”I''ve had my ups and downs, and when I was going through that   phase I told myself that if I was ever presented with these   opportunities I was going to take full advantage of them,” he   said. ”I have energy.

56888,78169,‘Trust and Respect Are the Lifeblood of Frank Conversations',Atlantic,Bourree Lam,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Readers, staffers, and others from the University of Chicago community discuss Dean John Ellison's injunction against trigger warnings and safe spaces. If you have something to add, particularly as a professor, alumnus, or current student at the University of Chicago, please email hello@theatlantic. com. (A previous reader discussion on trigger warnings and campus politics is here.) This comment comes from alumnus Joel Avila, who lives in Chicago and works as a program manager at CVS Health. It's so good that I'm posting the whole thing (bolding is my own). Joel touches on one particular angle I've been thinking about a lot regarding the national coverage on campus politics: If the premise of good faith is important for academic freedom, then do letters such as Ellison's build or erode that trust between people who disagree with each other? From Joel: “Love your neighbor as yourself” seems like a decent rule from which university communities are trying to create some kind of secular analogue to address this controversy. To me much of the controversy is actually about trust and respect (and the lack thereof) among students, faculty, and administrators.   contemporary social problems (e. g. student debt, sexual discrimination, racial prejudice) are typically deliberated on campus in ways less encumbered than in society at large, for the simple reason that you have unstructured time to talk about them with lots of different people. Having said all this, I have little faith in trigger warnings and safe spaces, from which standpoint I would make a few observations and comments: 1. The letter itself strikes me as a broad type of trigger warning (a “  warning,” if you will). By telling incoming   that they don't support trigger warnings, they are implicitly telling —  dare I say “warning” —  students that certain conversations on campus may trouble them. By making this statement in the welcome letter, the college is getting the benefit of giving a general trigger warning while discouraging particular ones. 2. Your magazine's big cover story last year made quite an impression on me, especially in the way it raised the question about safe spaces and mental health. My wife is an outpatient clinical therapist (SSA '13) and she said that the piece articulated her question of whether safe spaces could stunt emotional  . What follows is a quote from her: “In therapy, it's really important to learn that you can't keep other people from offending you, but that you can control your response. To become a successful adult, you have to recognize that other people are coming from different experiences and won't see things the same way as you. It's fundamental to almost every therapy approach that you change your own reaction, rather than demanding that your environment accommodate you. ” 3. The controversy over trigger warnings and safe spaces seems to be a phenomenon specific to elite institutions. I wouldn't be surprised if   colleges and universities are also experiencing this in some form or another. But I'm not reading about protests at UConn, UCF, Kansas State, or Northern Michigan University. Instead I'm reading about tensions at U of C, Yale, and Oberlin. “Simple random samples” of college campuses these are not. 4. Because of #3, I guess I don't see the endpoint of this debate as it relates to the social problems in light of which it emerged. Basically, what's the payoff for instituting trigger warnings and building safe spaces at elite institutions? What's the payoff for banning the same? I think people on either side —  but especially the “pro” camp —  will be disappointed and disillusioned when the underlying socioeconomic morbidities linger or worsen despite their best efforts. Going back to one of my first points, I think trust and respect are the lifeblood of frank conversations —  for academic environments and pretty much any other relationships. When people at elite academic institutions can practice these two virtues (because that's what they are) I think we can listen to each other in good faith and admit hard truths to one another. Evil is real. Greed is real. Power corrupts. Trauma and abuse are ubiquitous. Racism and its roots are deeper and uglier than we want to admit. Shame is paralyzing. We all fear “the other” —  other races, other genders, other classes, etc. All of this is really, really hard to process, let alone to speak in public. As an    first year (and still today as a   !) I certainly failed at this constantly. But life is hard and full of failure too. But if academic elites strive to do a better job at admitting hardship and failure, and speaking their fears in trusting, respectful communities (read Brené Brown!) I think this controversy won't go away, but it might gradually subside. As the New Testament says elsewhere, “perfect love casts out fear. ” We'll see. When I was at the University of Chicago, I remember students protesting every week. It was just a thing that happened. My professors often covered very uncomfortable topics such as racism, colonialism, slavery —  I even remember a particularly heated discussion about female circumcision. Frantz Fanon's Black Face, White Masks was required reading for the Core I remember some students crying during a class covering that text and everyone was so supportive. I have never felt “unsafe” in these spaces on the other hand, I have always felt I could walk out. Nothing was ever personal we were always debating for intellectual pursuit. That's why I find Dean Ellison's letter puzzling. Maybe the fact that such a problematic letter felt necessary to reclaim that dynamic shows how much it's broken down —  that neither students nor administrators feel they can trust each other to speak on open and respectful terms. But I do know that respectful discussion is happening between alumni, and I am certain good faith has been fundamental to these insightful conversations. In fact, my favorite feedback of the week has been from a former classmate who I often disagreed with in class: “Really enjoy reading your pieces (even when I disagree with them). ” As we sifted through responses to the famed University of Chicago letter, we figured it'd be worth spotlighting what instructors feel about the whole thing. After all, they arguably understand the impact safe spaces and trigger warnings have on the classroom better than anyone else. Educators recognize the value of challenging students intellectually they know students should, at times, feel uncomfortable with the learning material. But they also know that absolutes are dangerous —  that sometimes safe spaces and trigger warnings are conducive, and not antithetical, to the robust, stimulating intellectual environment they seek. And at the end of the day, they don't like being told how to run their classroom. Here's what some current or former university instructors had to say: Andrew Dombrowski, a former university instructor who's now a counselor at the Berkeley Free Clinic, which he describes as a “    oriented”   collective: Safe spaces are really emphasized in our training process and I'm not going to lie, the letter took me aback at first. For us, just as a point of clarification, safe spaces involve establishing certain rules and expectations in a   manner, rather than excluding people from given backgrounds. Anyway, what I've come to realize is that when properly deployed, safe spaces can actually be actually very congruent to the values of open and rigorous intellectual inquiry —  it's less about shielding people from challenging ideas, and more about encouraging people to open up and explore challenging ideas in a *more* fearless way because they don't have to worry about irrelevant stuff that doesn't have anything to do with the ideas or content under discussion. I still don't feel like I speak the language of safe spaces natively —  I tend to couch these values to myself in terms like   inquiry and “being a decent human being” —  but I don't think there has to be ANY conflict with the academic values that I remain committed to even now that I don't work in academia. I don't doubt that there are people who abuse the concept of safe spaces in order to shut people down, but those people can be criticized without lapsing into the “grumble grumble grumble damn kids these days just want to be coddled stupid kids don't want to be exposed to new ideas” discourse that is WAY too prevalent in this conversation. I'm very disappointed in the letter, because one of the principles of basic intellectual good practice that I learned at UChicago is to engage with the strongest reasonable form of an argument you're opposed to, not to snarkily set up a   argument in hopes that it will go viral (and let's not kid ourselves, this was done with an eye to the outside world and external publicity). That's what really bothers me here I'm less invested in the ultimate policy decision and more profoundly disappointed by the lack of intellectual rigor and honesty involved in failing to reckon with the other side. An anonymous alum: Now that I'm on the other side of the classroom, I try to create as welcoming of an intellectual space as I can. In economics we talk about some difficult issues: the gender pay gap, consequences of inequality, effects of migration, consequence of job loss, social policies such as welfare and rent control. These have the potential to be sensitive issues for the reason that the things we discuss in my classroom may have consequentially affected my students' lives outside the classroom. I always try, though I do not always succeed, to ensure that everyone feels like their voice is respected. But I don't permit any idea to be a sacred cow. That is, students will have to tolerate that others might disagree with their opinion. I require that they find a way to disagree with someone while maintaining respect for them, hopefully by employing data and facts, and not resorting to Trumpisms such as ad hominem attacks. I care much more about the process through which students come to hold their beliefs —  and that throughout they maintain respect for others —  than in any particular beliefs they hold. I have two experiences from teaching at an elite liberal arts school where I was accused by students of crossing the safe space line. In the first instance, I was teaching at a women's college. Two male students from a nearby university attended, so the class was approximately 90 percent female. Both of the male students were engineering students, whereas none of the female students were. In class I referenced the entrepreneur Elon Musk and got mostly blank stares but some nods from the male students. As an aside to the two male engineering students, I mentioned one of his projects. A female student later came to my office hours that week to discuss the incident. She voiced that singling out the male students in the class made the rest of the class feel uncomfortable. I thanked her for her feedback and asked her to return again if she found anything upsetting in the future. While personally I thought the student may have been overly sensitive, I appreciated the feedback. I strive to create a welcoming environment, and if there's ways I can do that better I want to know. In contrast, the other incident was handled quite differently. I was lecturing on wage setting and made the slightly indelicate comment “the firm buys this worker” to mean that a firm hired a worker at a given wage. A student interrupted my lecture, saying, “You can't say that. They aren't slaves. ” I was taken aback. Was this student suggesting that I condoned slavery? No sooner had the comment left my mouth than I realized there was a better way of phrasing it, but I didn't think it required interruption. I stumbled through the next 10 minutes of my lecture before returning to myself. Had this student come to my office and mentioned the comment I would have apologized and professed to be more careful. I left class embarrassed and, if I were honest, resentful towards the student for the interruption, whose comment I never would have been audacious enough to raise as an undergraduate. What's missing from this debate is a guideline for dialogue between students and faculty about how we can create a more welcoming classroom environment. If we want to discuss meaningful topics, students risk feeling discomfort. However, U of C's “no safe space allowed” mantra only gets us half the way there. The other crucial element is knowing how to resolve incidents when students feel distressed. Another anonymous alum: 1. I am largely supportive of this letter in its context as a cover letter for a longer book, which is how it was sent out. A letter to incoming freshmen does not actually set university policy that's reserved for the handbook that no one reads. 2. Trigger warnings, safe spaces, and speaker censorship are all actually different issues. 3. I am largely against university “trigger warnings. ” The example that is usually used is of sexual assault survivors being triggered, which most decent people immediately agree with. I would propose the more ridiculous example of someone with extreme arachnophobia. Should an instructor teaching The Lord of the Rings have to say “Warning: Spiders?” If not, why not? Are some traumas more    than others? 4. I am very pro insightful contextualization before a piece of media. In film class, rather than “Warning: This film has rape,” a sensible and sensitive instructor might say “I want you to pay attention to how the stillness and position of the camera makes the audience complicit. ” 5. Students have the option of opting out of anything they want to. They just get penalized for it. 6. Students who have gone through the official steps of seeking accommodations (for dyslexia, ADD, PTSD, etc.) should be respected and accommodated. They are not a burden. Timothy   an associate professor of history at Rutgers: While I don't use trigger warnings in the classroom, I'd be appalled if an administrator at my own institution attempted to dictate to me or my students what they should expect from their instructors with regard to such warnings. It would abrogate my academic freedom as an instructor. In this context, Ellison's words cruelly ignore the recent and devastating history of indifference by University of Chicago administrators to marginalized students' safety. I think the University of Chicago has a fetish of the universal and a hostility toward concepts or ideas that can be construed as “particular. ” (For example, as a graduate student there, I taught a course that at most other institutions would be called “Introduction to LGBT Studies” at Chicago, it is, or at least was, called “Problems in the Study of Sexuality. ”) There is a concomitant sense that the heroic individual scholar can and should engage in the life of the mind, without being embedded in the messy realities of the real world. In its most troubling versions, this leads to a sense on the part of administrators that discrimination and structural oppression can be wished or willed away, or that catering to demands for inclusion would somehow be “coddling. ” This letter about trigger warnings  safe spaces? In my view, it's not at all motivated by actual concern about TWs and safe spaces. Continuing our series of comments from the University of Chicago community regarding Dean John Ellison's letter, some alumni and students have expressed that the move smelled, at least partially, like a publicity stunt. From one current University of Chicago student, who hints that the administration has been trying to change the image of those beloved strange “dark” days of the school I remember so well: To me, the whole situation reads as a poorly conceived publicity stunt. The University is in this strange moment where its undergrad exclusivity has recently shot up, and it seems to want to do everything it can to bolster its reputation. The College also attempting to rebrand through ditching the    masochism tone of prior decades and attempting to court a reputation of Fun, Exciting Academic Rigor. However, this all leaves the College without a coherent identity, and the admins pinned their hopes on riding the   wave of think pieces on the matter, which would allow them to capitalize on dissatisfaction with the Millennial bogeyman's perceived censorship problem, hostility toward the ivory tower, and the massive moderate frustrated by youth movements in general. It certainly doesn't represent any actual policy change: the University has explicitly said that this is not a blanket ban on trigger warnings, but that it still allows professors to choose what to do at their discretion. I have no idea whether it worked. It will have appealed to those forces I mentioned, but of course will also drive away prospective students involved in the   community. From another alum: Have you ever actually had a lesson plan or discussion section disrupted because students claimed they felt “triggered” by the material? Sometimes I find the language and the logic of the “trigger warning” a bit stultifying, but really that's only in the abstract because no one has ever actually invoked it. I can count the number of times a student has asked to take a step back from a set of readings or a specific conversation on one hand, and then it's with ample, generous explanation and always when we were dealing with genuinely disturbing material. I suppose this letter disappoints me because it reads like fairly blatant administrative grandstanding. More insidiously, I am afraid that it will produce the very effects that it claims it is trying to prevent —  the foreclosure of a dialogue between all interested parties. And lastly, an alum questions whether the letter is speaking to the university's community and how consistent the university's administration has been on the issue: I find the letter from U of C to be somewhat embarrassing. On the surface, who can argue with academic freedom? But I take the appeal to it here to be fairly empty posturing and, more importantly, it's part of a pattern of the administration appealing to academic freedom at the same time as —  or in order to —  act badly. When I was an undergrad they were refusing to divest from Darfur because taking a political stance would somehow violate academic freedom. It seemed to me at the time to be a fairly transparent attempt to preserve the status quo and avoid a financial hassle —  and I'm skeptical that divestment was in any way contrary to the famous Kalven Report. And we can add to this the University's treatment of protesters, including those who were agitating for a trauma unit at the hospitals and the more recent threats against the student body president who organized a  . Throw in the   letter that the president just sent, too. Appealing to academic freedom while acting this way may not be acting inconsistently, exactly, but it isn't great. What I take away from all of this is that the administrators don't care about academic freedom. They care about their  . And their interest is in propping up the speech of some and not others. In making their decisions, I have a hard time imagining these administrators sitting around thinking carefully about the meaning of academic freedom in all of its complexity and nuance. That kind of pondering was what my professors taught me at U of C. What I read is a letter with all the nuance and care of a talk radio host. I'm confident that Chicago will continue being a great school with incredible faculty and students doing amazing things. This letter contributes nothing to the quality of the institution —  nor does it detract from it. It's a shadow on the wall of the cave. I wish it had been something worth our time, because these issues do matter. I don't think that trigger warnings and safe spaces are inconsistent with academic freedom —  not in the least. But I don't think that this is about that —  it's just an attempt at branding, as well as ignoring or silencing or marginalizing protest at the University. It sets up those that want the University to act as a better citizen (with respect to its students and the broader community) as  . And while those that protest very well might be wrong —  that's debatable, for sure —  I think the   slant is an insubstantial smear. If we're going to have a   conversation about trigger warnings and safe spaces, then fine. The Dean should write the kind of reasoned, deep treatment of the issues that the U of C community deserves. Yesterday, my colleague, Bourree Lam, looked at how University of Chicago alumni are responding to the   letter their alma mater sent out last week to incoming freshmen. The letter essentially warned students that the university —  which for decades has espoused its commitment to “freedom of expression” —  would not tolerate “intellectual ‘safe spaces'” and “  ‘trigger warnings. '” The thinking behind the letter, presumably, is that safe spaces and trigger warnings inherently suppress free speech and academic freedom —  and, in turn, that the university felt a need to defend those values. As Bourree highlighted yesterday, that premise outraged many alumni, who remember their years at the university as experiences rife with challenging and uncomfortable discussions. Others argued that the wholesale rejection of things like trigger warnings misses the point. It got us thinking: What is a trigger warning, anyway? What defines a safe space? Lots of people have questioned whether Dean of Students John Ellison, who wrote the letter, actually understands what the terms mean. My colleague, Conor Friedersdorf, chimed in on the topic this morning. Here's what some from the academic community had to say. From an alum, Audrey Truschke: I would say that the letter brought up mixed reactions from me. I wholeheartedly support the basic idea that universities ought to have a strong, unflinching commitment to academic freedom of speech, and I think numerous institutions have dangerously compromised that ideal recently. That said, I use trigger warnings periodically on syllabi. I started including them formally, as part of the written syllabus, last year when I realized that I had been doing them informally for years. For me, it always seemed to be common sense that when you find yourself, say, assigning a graphic description of rape, you might give your students a   during the prior class meeting, concerning what they are about to read. Even now, I often issue ”trigger warnings” more informally. For instance, this past spring I sent out a podcast on female genital mutilation to my students with the caveat that they should not listen to it while driving. I had made that mistake, I told them, and nearly had to pull over at one point because it was such a hard listen and brought tears to my eyes. The point of giving due warning, for me, is not to silence debate but rather to prepare people so that they can (hopefully) move beyond their understandable initial reactions of shock, horror, disgust, and trauma and enter into an intellectual discussion of the materials and questions at hand. From another alum, Nabeel Ebeid: More than anything, I'm embarrassed. UChicago taught me to question so many assumptions and helped me to revise so many of my priors with logic and data. For the school to send its undergrads a letter without a clear definition of “safe space” or “trigger warning,” without any reference to sexual assault, harassment, or the contexts in which these words emerged, and without substantiating any link between those terms and academic freedom, Ellison is being lazy at best and, at worst, gratuitously malicious. One need not denigrate safe spaces or trigger warnings to support academic freedom or defend the right to bring controversial speakers to campus. More puzzling is that the school is full of safe spaces: the Center for Identity and Inclusion (Amandla Center in my day) worship groups, any number of campus affinity groups, etc (to say nothing of health counselors' offices). The school appears to endorse them wholeheartedly, and it's hard to imagine a day when it wouldn't. These spaces have provided both vibrant fora for   discussion as well as support systems for the marginalized. In my time at UChicago, they contributed to campus conversation with a wide array of speakers and perspectives that were often underrepresented in the Core. I can't recall a single instance in which these communities stifled free speech. The aversion to trigger warnings seems even stranger. Trigger warnings by definition prepare the reader or listener for triggering content the notion that these warnings stifle speech is unsubstantiated and farfetched. I also wonder how taking a stance against trigger warnings doesn't stifle the free speech of professors who may see value in sensitivity when introducing potentially triggering material. Finally, I wonder what kind of message a note like this sends to community members who may already be wary from recent Title IX investigations. Ellison seems to be reacting viscerally to the feeling that the marginalized have it too easy. If he was concerned about disinviting speakers, he could have said as much. Instead, he chose to bash vaguely   terms without appearing to understand them, and he strung them together into a paragraph of non sequiturs . .. all in the name of freedom. From another alum, Maira Khwaja, who graduated this past June: Dean Ellison misrepresents what trigger warnings and safe spaces have been on our campus, which are often nuanced and personalized for each professor (UChicago is nothing if not nuanced and overly verbose) and syllabi and department and extracurricular. His simplification, misrepresentation, and conflation of trigger     speakers are poor examples of the “rigorous discourse” that he boasts. In our histories of violence class, we did not shy away from any of America's most brutal understudied history, but we were given a thoughtful paragraph on the syllabus about the nature of the images and text we'd read in the archive. It'd be naive and foolish to disregard that thoughtful paragraph from our professor as something other than analysis that contributed to class discussion and understanding. Safe spaces are not made so that students can “retreat” from ideas they don't want to hear in fact, often safe spaces are built in our campus so that they can dive even further, with careful support (like support staff on hand, or respectful mutually made ground rules created) into discussions that would often be too uncomfortable for the classroom. An anonymous alum: I'm very disappointed in this admin at my former school over his nonsense about trigger warnings destroying freedom. And I love that it's a scholar at my current one so splendidly calling him out: As CUNY historian Angus Johnston notes, “There's no college in the country where profs are required to give trigger warnings. They're all voluntary pedagogical choices. Which means a professor's use of trigger warnings isn't a threat to academic freedom. It's a MANIFESTATION of academic freedom. '” Academic freedom means that professors get to design their syllabus, not administrators like Ellison. His letter is a prime example of how the outcry against “political correctness” often leads to policy changes that limit free speech.” Over the past week, my alma mater has been all over my (and probably your) news feed. The general dramatic headline: There will not be safe spaces or trigger warnings at the University of Chicago, according to a letter sent by John Ellison, dean of students at the university, to incoming freshmen. The letter immediately became a dot on the timeline of the ongoing national debate on campus politics, political correctness, and academic freedom —  the media narrative being that an administration takes a stand on free speech and academic freedom, and that's followed swiftly by support and pushback from students, experts, and pundits. I went to the University of Chicago for undergrad in the early 2000s. I studied economics and sociology, and I have very fond memories of the school's peculiar culture: the way students laughed off the bitter winters, the way pulling   at the library (shoutout to the  ) was cool, the super weird school traditions like Scavhunt —  so strange that The NYer once devoted nearly 4, 000 words to it. It's a place where people knowingly enrolled even though they've been told it's a place “where fun comes to die. ” I think we took pride in the image that we were young people who wanted to participate in school that was intellectually rigorous (the “life of the mind”) where a class about Nabokov's Lolita or Foucault's History of Sexuality were so popular it was hard to find a seat, where education was its own end, and everyone was a bit odd in their own way. I think my peers and I worried that culture (beloved by us) was starting to fade when I graduated in 2007: The school had switched from the UnCommon App to the Common App. The school started to rise in rankings, which was favorable for alumni   but we worried that it was at the cost of the school's identity and the students it would attract. The University of Chicago is about hard classes, but it's also about community.   In NY, where I live now, alumni are often   friend groups —  my    spouse regularly laments that he knows more alumni from the U of C than his own university —  that meet up regularly to have discussions not dissimilar to classes. (It's also interesting to note that some 20 percent of U of C alumni end up in academia.) With Ellison's letter, we all pondered what it's going to mean, and we did that together online. This week, I'm going to highlight some of the interesting discussions I've seen on social media and responses from the University of Chicago community. My colleague Alia Wong will join me in discussing these comments from students and alumni who share deep connections to the school and each other. For them, Ellison's letter is personal, in contrast to the way the national debate on campus politics can sometimes feel removed. From one alum, Laura Oppenheimer: I take an inordinate amount of pride in how hard I worked as a student at the U of C. My courses were not dumbed down, no one held my hand, and I was expected to read, grapple with, and discuss everything —  ranging from Plato and Marx, to Four Hours in My Lai and Night. The reading was difficult, and frequently, so was the subject matter. What I wish Ellison had said was, “as students at the University of Chicago, you will be expected to read, study and discuss many types of work, including work that may be upsetting, or work you may disagree with. This is part of a rigorous, academic education. ” Instead, he issued a blanket statement that the school doesn't give trigger warnings, which are something that serve to protect those who may have PTSD due to past trauma. To me, despite the way trigger warnings have been   by overly sensitive college students, this was a misstep. I applaud the ethos, but I wish the administration had refined the message and made it about free speech and academic discourse, focusing more on the message it was trying to deliver, and less on grabbing a moment in the spotlight. From another alum: As a 2006 graduate, I have to say I completely support Ellison's letter 100 percent.  It really surprised me a lot because I didn't expect the University to go that far in support of true free speech, since free speech is not very popular these days, especially on college campuses.  But I am very glad (and proud) that the University took such a position.  I hope that they stick to it.  (Though as an aside, I also wonder how many people are hearing about the University for the very first time because of this letter —  and to what extent that is a good thing or a bad thing.) A particularly insightful Facebook post from alum Nasia Anam: I don't think it would be a stretch to call University of Chicago a school of intellectual hard knocks. This has always been the unarticulated social contract of matriculating at U of C —  the place that attracts kids who proudly don   emblazoned with the motto “Where Fun Comes to Die,” and [where] the   winter break is unofficially known as “Suicide Prevention Day. ”   …     But a wholesale dismissal of “trigger warnings” and “safe spaces” as flimsy excuses for coddled millennials to continue lives of comfort, puppies, and   (not Plato!   to) is simultaneously a refusal to acknowledge an extremely problematic stance on student mental health. Clinical depression is not a prerequisite in the life of the mind, and being   by class material does not facilitate “freedom of inquiry and expression” but, quite to the contrary, precludes and damages a fruitful learning process. To make students uncomfortable, to create friction and tension in the classroom, lecture hall, auditorium, etc. —  these are invaluable pedagogical tools. Asking students to exacerbate existing pain, trauma, or mental disturbance or enter spaces where they feel endangered or ashamed does absolutely nothing for the honorable pursuit of  . . .. My problem with the letter is not that it raises the issues of “trigger warnings” and “safe spaces” as dubious, but the unnecessarily harsh tone it takes. There is an underlying   assumption that incoming freshmen (legal adults, I might add) will not be able, of their own accord, to determine what may or may not be traumatic for them. Traumatic. Not disturbing, not unsettling. Traumatic. Trauma is a   psychological condition, and the fact that the letter gives it absolutely no credence gives the impression to incoming undergraduates that their mental health is not an issue that needs or warrants any attention whatsoever.   …     We should put pressure upon the concept of “trigger warnings” and “safe spaces,” yes. We should be vigilant about the ways these accommodative practices are abused. But to completely dismiss these pedagogical caveats as   psychobabble hooha is not only retrograde, it is contra to the aims of an administration that ostensibly seeks a more diverse population of students. Free expression and inquiry can by its very nature only occur in spaces where all individuals understand themselves to be equally free. Hostile and punitive classroom environments do not facilitate this goal. We should be debating and complicating the ideas of “trigger warnings” and ”safe spaces,” not dismissing them.

56889,78170,Gaffe Track: Trump's Lie on Discussing the Wall,Atlantic,David A. Graham,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Every presidential campaign is full of unpredictable twists and turns. After a brief moment where it looked like the nation might slouch into a   rematch, the 2016 election is taking its place in that line of strange journeys. The one sure thing: There will be gaffes. Some will be humorous verbal   of the Bushian variety (“we ought to make the pie higher”) while others will seem more revealing of a candidate's weaknesses (Herman Cain's tetchy dismissal of questions about “    ”). Some will seem important but ultimately have little effect (like “Bittergate”). Some will seem damaging but actually do little (Rick Perry's “oops”) while others will seem minor at first but prove more damaging (Perry's statement that those who oppose education for illegal immigrants “don't have a heart. ”) Some, like the latter Perry remark, will be Kinsley gaffes, where a politician accidentally tells the truth about facts or his own views. The very occasional gaffe will end up defining an entire cycle, as Mitt Romney's secretly videotaped comment about “the 47 percent” did. Knowing that the range of gaffes is wide, and that the import of a gaffe is often inflated (or overlooked) early on, Gaffe Track is The Atlantic's bid to cover these gaffes with a consistent approach, creating a nearly   chronological inventory of the missteps, miscalculations, and misstatements of the 2016 presidential campaign. The candidate: Trump, The gaffe: On Wednesday, the Republican nominee traveled to Mexico City to meet with Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto. At a press conference, the men were asked if they d discussed Trump s promise to make Mexico pay for a border wall.  Who pays for the wall? We didn t discuss it, ? Trump said. (Listen for yourself here.) Later, PeÃ±a Nieto issued a statement claiming he had ruled it out. Then Trump s campaign issued a statement that didn t dispute that. Then on Thursday, on Laura Ingraham s radio show, Trump claimed he had said that they did discuss it: Trump to @ingrahamangle: ”I said, no, we did discuss the wall.” He was asked about who would pay for it. pic. twitter.  (Listen here: Trump: 'Hillary Moves Slow On Everything  We Will Have Softening On Immigration') It s a fantastic claim, in the sense of being both amazing and also being a fantasy anyone can listen to Trump s press conference and hear clearly what he said. The defense: Â¯'_( ãƒ„) ¯ Why it matters (or doesn t):  The lesson: The walls have ears, whether they are discussed or not ”and so do the rest of us. The candidate: Trump, The gaffe: Jake Anantha is an    Charlotte, North Carolina, man who is   and was, until Thursday night, a fervent Trump supporter looking forward to casting his first vote for president for the Republican. But when he went to Trump s rally in Charlotte, he was ejected ”he believes because of the color of his skin.  I told him I've never been to another rally in my life. I m a huge Trump supporter. I would never protest against Trump, ? he told CNN.  I do think it s because I m brown. ? The defense: Security told Anantha that he looked just like a man who d caused trouble at previous ralli. .. ”wait, no, that doesn t actually make it any better. Why it matters (or doesn t): On a basic level, it s not a good idea to alienate your supporters, especially when you re already down by several points in the polls. (Anantha now says he ll perhaps vote for Gary Johnson.) The incident offers ammunition to anyone who thinks the Trump campaign is driven by racial resentment and dislike of minorities. On the plus side, Trump doesn t really have enough minority supporters for this to make a dent. The lesson: If you support candidates who back racial profiling, you might get racially profiled at their rallies. The candidate: Clinton, The gaffe: Who s that standing behind the Democratic nominee during a rally in Kissimmee, Florida? Oh, just Seddique Mateen, the father of Orlando nightclub gunman Omar Mateen and a man who has espoused   and   views, in addition to peculiar statements suggesting he holds some power in Afghanistan. The defense: In a statement to WPTV, the Clinton campaign said,  The rally was a     event for the public. This individual wasn't invited as a guest and the campaign was unaware of his attendance until after the event. ? (Mateen also said he had just decided to go.) Why it matters (or doesn t): This isn t a major gaffe by the candidate, but it s sort of baffling. Sure, events are open to the public, but how did staffers allow their boss to get in a situation where she was standing in front of Mateen, sitting somewhat prominently in the grandstand? He s not the name you want in headlines with Clinton. Perhaps Trump was right:  We have no idea where they come from, we have no idea who the hell they are. We know they believe in certain things that we don t want to believe in. ? The lesson: Screen anyone who might appear on screen. The candidate: Trump, The gaffe: On Wednesday, the Republican nominee talked about watching a video of American officials unloading cash in Iran. The cash was real ”a Wall Street Journal scoop revealed it ”but there was no video. Trump s spokeswoman admitted that to The Washington Post, saying he was referring to a different video. And yet on Thursday, Trump once again claimed to have watched the video.  I woke up yesterday and I saw $400 million ”different currencies, they probably don t want our currency ”being flown to Iran, ? he said in Maine on Thursday.  You know it was interesting, because a tape was made, with the airplane coming in, nice airplane, and the money coming off I guess. That was given to us, has to be, by the Iranians. You know why the tape was given to us? Because they want to embarrass our country. ? The defense: The first time Trump made the claim, it was plausible he was just confused. But now? Why it matters (or doesn t): There are two possibilities, neither especially flattering. One is that the campaign knows Trump is mistaken, but no one bothered to tell the candidate, leaving him to make a public gaffe. Another is that Trump knows quite well and doesn t care. It takes a special sort of brazenness, and a certain kind of faith in one s base, and probably a certain sort of delusion about how politics works, to assume that you can get away with lying about this. It s not the first time Trump has claimed to have seen a video that didn t exist ”like when he described tape of Muslims supposedly celebrating   in New Jersey. So maybe Trump really does believe he saw the tape. Which isn t a good sign either. The moral: The camera doesn t lie, but the candidate might. The candidate: Clinton, The gaffe: Speaking in Omaha on Tuesday, the Democrat said,  Trump wants to cut taxes for the super rich, ? she said, to boos.  Well, we re not going there, my friends. I m telling you right now, we re going to write fairer rules for the middle class and we ? ”here s where things get interesting. Some people heard what she said as  are going to raise taxes for the middle class. ? But on a closer listen, she s clearly saying  aren t. ? The defense: Even if Clinton had said  are, ? it would be a clear slip of the tongue, not a declaration of policy. Clinton has promised not to raised taxes on anyone making up to $250, 000 ”significantly higher than most reasonable definitions of the middle class, although   groups argue she d do so anyway through backdoor methods. Why it matters (or doesn t): Some conservatives will take this as a Kinsley gaffe, the classic variety in which a candidate accidentally tells the truth, but substantively, there s not much here. Not since Fritz Mondale has a Democratic candidate been willing to say he or she will raise taxes on the middle class, and Mondale got shellacked. Clinton s not about to emulate him. The lesson: Mumbles risk grumbles and campaign fumbles. The candidate: Clinton, The gaffe: Speaking to Fox News  Chris Wallace on July 30, Clinton said of her email scandal,  [FBI] Director [James] Comey said my answers were truthful, and what I ve said is consistent with what I have told the American people, that there were decisions discussed and made to classify retroactively certain of the emails. ? Except as The Washington Post explains, that s not what he said at all. While Comey said Clinton had not lied to the FBI and recommended against charging her, he was also clear that she had emailed classified material. The defense: Clinton is right that Comey deemed her not to have lied to the FBI, at least. Why it matters (or doesn t): As my colleague Ron Fournier writes, Clinton s insistence on continuing to lie about what Comey said is puzzling. Even as she has apologized for using the server and escaped indictment, she apparently can t bring herself to simply eat crow and move on, and instead misstates easily available facts. For a candidate already facing serious trust issues with much of the electorate, that seems unwise. Luckily for her, Trump has decided to launch a feud with Gold Star parents, propose appeasing Putin, and say the election is rigged, distracting a great deal of attention. The lesson: Keep it straight and the election could be signed, sealed, and delivered to Clinton. Otherwise, the   is in the email. The candidate: Trump, The gaffe: USA Today s Kirsten Powers asked Trump about the allegations of sexual harassment that toppled Fox News honcho Roger Ailes. When Trump downplayed them, she asked how he d feel if his daughter was harassed.  I would like to think she would find another career or find another company if that was the case, ? he said. Tuesday morning, Trump s son Eric tried to clean it up. While saying harassment should be reported and dealt with, he added,  I don t think she would allow herself to be subjected to that. ? The defense: The Republican has said he  would be the best for women ? and that  Nobody has more respect for women than Trump! ? Why it matters (or doesn t): As Powers notes, Trump s answer falls short for several reasons. It overlooks the fact that not all women can easily just leave a job. Moreover, it pushes the illegality of harassment off to the side, while placing the burden to rectify the situation on victims of sexual harassment. Eric Trump s answer, meanwhile, implies that victims of harassment are somehow not  strong. ? These sorts of statements matter because they re liable to alienate women, a group with which Trump already trails badly ”  in a recent CNN poll his unfavorable rating with women is even worse. The lesson: Don t blame the victim, especially if the victim is a voter. The candidate: Trump, The gaffe: Speaking to ABC s George Stephanopoulos, Trump said of Russian President Vladimir Putin,  He's not going into Ukraine, OK? Just so you understand. He's not going to go into Ukraine, all right? You can mark it down and you can put it down, you can take it anywhere you want. ? Stephanopoulos pointed out that Russia had already annexed Crimea. The response was classic Trump: This is all proof of how terrible Obama is, but also it s not really so bad. He confirmed that he would consider recognizing the annexation:  But, you know, the people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were. ? The defense: It s Obama s fault, or something. Why it matters (or doesn t): At first glance, this looks like a classic example of Trump just not really knowing what he s talking about, a trait that endears him to supporters (he s a  !) and terrifies opponents (he s dangerously ignorant! ). But on closer glance, this is evidence of Trump s radically different approach to foreign policy. In his worldview, Russia seizing sovereign territory in violation of international law is acceptable. He even parrots the Kremlin line that Crimeans have a right to   ”further evidence of a close alignment between Putin and Trump. The lesson: A politician shouldn t Kiev his opponents ammunition with unforced errors ”but then again, the only Sebastopol that matters is on election day. The candidate: Trump, The gaffe: On Thursday, Khizr Khan, the father of slain U. S. Army solider Humayun Khan, delivered the most memorable moment of either party convention. Speaking at the DNC, Khan said,  Clinton was right when she called my son  the best of America.  If it was up to Trump, he never would have been in America. ? Khan continued asked whether Trump had ever read the Constitution and said,  You have sacrificed nothing and no one. ? Asked about that by ABC s George Stephanopoulos, Trump first questioned why Khizr Khan s wife Ghazala did not speak.  If you look at his wife, she was standing there, ? he said.  She had nothing to say. She probably, maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say. Then Trump said he d sacrificed:  I think I've made a lot of sacrifices. I work very, very hard. I've created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures. I've done, I've had tremendous success. ? A somewhat incredulous Stephanopoulos asked if those were really sacrifices.  Oh, sure. I think they're sacrifices, ? Trump said. The defense: The Trump campaign sent out the full transcript of his remarks Sunday, suggesting they were exculpatory. Not so much. Why it matters (or doesn t): At this early stage, this looks like one of the rare gaffes that might stick. Khizr Khan s speech was devastating, with a grieving immigrant father whose son died for the USA calling Trump out for proposing a ban on Muslims entering the country. Trump s response was to make a snarky remark (for the record, Ghazala Khan, who has spoken in interviews, said she was too emotional to speak) and then to claim, incredibly, that having a successful business career was somewhat an equivalent sacrifice to having a son die in combat. (Trump, a   once likened his quest to avoid STDs to the Vietnam War.) The comment speaks for itself, but not in a good way. Just wait: Trump might still make it worse. Sunday morning, he defended his right to counterpunch at Khan Sunday morning: I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me! The lesson: Sacrificing oneself on the altar of propriety and respectability does not qualify as  . The candidate: Donald J.  ¦ Crump? Can t really recall. The gaffe: During a July 27 news conference ”yep, the same one where he called on Russia to release hacked U. S. government information ”the Republican repeatedly referred to Tim Kaine, the U. S. senator from Virginia who is Clinton s running mate, as a New Jerseyan. The defense: Trump seems to have been confusing Kaine with Tom Kean, a Republican who was Garden State governor, and whose name is pronounced  cane. ? No word on the whereabouts of Herman Cain. Why it matters (or doesn t): This is one of the more ephemeral gaffes, and pales in importance compared to his bizarre plea to Russia. (The whole press conference was weird.) Mostly, it suggests Trump either can t or doesn t care to master the details of politics. The lesson: If you re going for a Kaine break, be careful you don t graze Kean instead. The candidate: Trump. Yep, again. The gaffe: On July 2, Trump tweeted out an image featuring Clinton s face over a background of cash, with a   star reading  Most corrupt candidate ever. ? Many people immediately recognized this as an   dogwhistle, as the   Star of David is a symbol of Judaism. Trump deleted the tweet, then resent the same image with the star changed to a circle. The defense: Trump argues that it was a sheriff s badge, or perhaps a  basic ?   star. But a sheriff s badge wouldn t make any sense in this context. There s also the small problem that the image appears to have originated in a    message board, then traveled to an   Twitter account before being picked up by Trump. Why it matters (or doesn t): Trump s tweet has produced a heated debate over whether Trump is  . That argument is to a certain extent beside the point. It s hard ”though some diehards are finding ways ”to ignore the pattern of Trump encouraging   and other racist elements, regardless of whether Trump himself bears any personal animus toward Jews. (One of his staunch defenders at this moment is his    Jared Kushner, who is Jewish.) Time and again, Trump has tweeted or retweeted material that originated with white supremacists. There was also, of course, the moment where he declined to condemn an endorsement from former KKK leader David Duke, and later tried to blame it on a bad earpiece. (Duke helpfully insists the star was a Star of David, by the way.) The white supremacists are certainly convinced that Trump is speaking to them with a wink and a nudge. In any case, Trump shows no remorse. The lesson: This schmuck s shtick is still a shanda. The candidate: Donald J. Trump, The gaffe: Speaking in Raleigh, North Carolina, last night, Trump found the positive side of the late repressive, genocidal Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. ”He was a bad guy ”really bad guy. But you know what? He did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn't read them the rights. They didn't talk. They were terrorists. Over. Today, Iraq is Harvard for terrorism. ? The defense: There s a coherent case that toppling Saddam was a grave error because it destabilized the Middle East and led to sectarian wars, broader regional dysfunction, and ISIS. Also, the Harvard remark is kind of hilarious trolling coming from a Penn grad. Why it matters (or doesn t): Here s a handy,   guide for presidential candidates on when to praise Saddam Hussein:  Never. ? Whatever the case to be made that toppling Saddam was a bad idea, it s not really the case Trump made. Instead, he praised a war criminal for his handling of enemies, and a known sponsor of terrorism for his killing of terrorists. (When Henry Kissinger makes the case for cozying up to repressive dictators because of American   he s revered as a wise statesman, but when Trump does it, everyone is appalled ”though maybe that says more about Kissinger than about Trump.) This isn t the first time Trump has argued the world would be better off with Saddam in power, and it s not even the first time he s made the  Harvard of Terrorism ? joke. But once again, the Republican has managed to trip on his own feet, distracting from condemnation of Clinton s email. It s a weird comment to make in North Carolina, a state with many Iraq veterans, though he also suggested in Greensboro that U. S. soldiers siphoned reconstruction funds. Anyway, all of this would ring a lot more true if Trump had been opposed to the Iraq war from the start. But despite his claims, he clearly supported it. The lesson: Praising Saddam can make a candidate s image go from Baath to worse.         For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.

56890,78171,What ‘Safe Space' Looks Like In the Classroom,Atlantic,Alia Wong,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Readers, staffers, and others from the University of Chicago community discuss Dean John Ellison's injunction against trigger warnings and safe spaces. If you have something to add, particularly as a professor, alumnus, or current student at the University of Chicago, please email hello@theatlantic. com. (A previous reader discussion on trigger warnings and campus politics is here.) As we sifted through responses to the famed University of Chicago letter, we figured it'd be worth spotlighting what instructors feel about the whole thing. After all, they arguably understand the impact safe spaces and trigger warnings have on the classroom better than anyone else. Educators recognize the value of challenging students intellectually they know students should, at times, feel uncomfortable with the learning material. But they also know that absolutes are dangerous —  that sometimes safe spaces and trigger warnings are conducive, and not antithetical, to the robust, stimulating intellectual environment they seek. And at the end of the day, they don't like being told how to run their classroom. Here's what some current or former university instructors had to say: Andrew Dombrowski, a former university instructor who's now a counselor at the Berkeley Free Clinic, which he describes as a “    oriented”   collective: Safe spaces are really emphasized in our training process and I'm not going to lie, the letter took me aback at first. For us, just as a point of clarification, safe spaces involve establishing certain rules and expectations in a   manner, rather than excluding people from given backgrounds. Anyway, what I've come to realize is that when properly deployed, safe spaces can actually be actually very congruent to the values of open and rigorous intellectual inquiry —  it's less about shielding people from challenging ideas, and more about encouraging people to open up and explore challenging ideas in a *more* fearless way because they don't have to worry about irrelevant stuff that doesn't have anything to do with the ideas or content under discussion. I still don't feel like I speak the language of safe spaces natively —  I tend to couch these values to myself in terms like   inquiry and “being a decent human being” —  but I don't think there has to be ANY conflict with the academic values that I remain committed to even now that I don't work in academia. I don't doubt that there are people who abuse the concept of safe spaces in order to shut people down, but those people can be criticized without lapsing into the “grumble grumble grumble damn kids these days just want to be coddled stupid kids don't want to be exposed to new ideas” discourse that is WAY too prevalent in this conversation. I'm very disappointed in the letter, because one of the principles of basic intellectual good practice that I learned at UChicago is to engage with the strongest reasonable form of an argument you're opposed to, not to snarkily set up a   argument in hopes that it will go viral (and let's not kid ourselves, this was done with an eye to the outside world and external publicity). That's what really bothers me here I'm less invested in the ultimate policy decision and more profoundly disappointed by the lack of intellectual rigor and honesty involved in failing to reckon with the other side. An anonymous alum: Now that I'm on the other side of the classroom, I try to create as welcoming of an intellectual space as I can. In economics we talk about some difficult issues: the gender pay gap, consequences of inequality, effects of migration, consequence of job loss, social policies such as welfare and rent control. These have the potential to be sensitive issues for the reason that the things we discuss in my classroom may have consequentially affected my students' lives outside the classroom. I always try, though I do not always succeed, to ensure that everyone feels like their voice is respected. But I don't permit any idea to be a sacred cow. That is, students will have to tolerate that others might disagree with their opinion. I require that they find a way to disagree with someone while maintaining respect for them, hopefully by employing data and facts, and not resorting to Trumpisms such as ad hominem attacks. I care much more about the process through which students come to hold their beliefs —  and that throughout they maintain respect for others —  than in any particular beliefs they hold. I have two experiences from teaching at an elite liberal arts school where I was accused by students of crossing the safe space line. In the first instance, I was teaching at a women's college. Two male students from a nearby university attended, so the class was approximately 90 percent female. Both of the male students were engineering students, whereas none of the female students were. In class I referenced the entrepreneur Elon Musk and got mostly blank stares but some nods from the male students. As an aside to the two male engineering students, I mentioned one of his projects. A female student later came to my office hours that week to discuss the incident. She voiced that singling out the male students in the class made the rest of the class feel uncomfortable. I thanked her for her feedback and asked her to return again if she found anything upsetting in the future. While personally I thought the student may have been overly sensitive, I appreciated the feedback. I strive to create a welcoming environment, and if there's ways I can do that better I want to know. In contrast, the other incident was handled quite differently. I was lecturing on wage setting and made the slightly indelicate comment “the firm buys this worker” to mean that a firm hired a worker at a given wage. A student interrupted my lecture, saying, “You can't say that. They aren't slaves. ” I was taken aback. Was this student suggesting that I condoned slavery? No sooner had the comment left my mouth than I realized there was a better way of phrasing it, but I didn't think it required interruption. I stumbled through the next 10 minutes of my lecture before returning to myself. Had this student come to my office and mentioned the comment I would have apologized and professed to be more careful. I left class embarrassed and, if I were honest, resentful towards the student for the interruption, whose comment I never would have been audacious enough to raise as an undergraduate. What's missing from this debate is a guideline for dialogue between students and faculty about how we can create a more welcoming classroom environment. If we want to discuss meaningful topics, students risk feeling discomfort. However, U of C's “no safe space allowed” mantra only gets us half the way there. The other crucial element is knowing how to resolve incidents when students feel distressed. Another anonymous alum: 1. I am largely supportive of this letter in its context as a cover letter for a longer book, which is how it was sent out. A letter to incoming freshmen does not actually set university policy that's reserved for the handbook that no one reads. 2. Trigger warnings, safe spaces, and speaker censorship are all actually different issues. 3. I am largely against university “trigger warnings. ” The example that is usually used is of sexual assault survivors being triggered, which most decent people immediately agree with. I would propose the more ridiculous example of someone with extreme arachnophobia. Should an instructor teaching The Lord of the Rings have to say “Warning: Spiders?” If not, why not? Are some traumas more    than others? 4. I am very pro insightful contextualization before a piece of media. In film class, rather than “Warning: This film has rape,” a sensible and sensitive instructor might say “I want you to pay attention to how the stillness and position of the camera makes the audience complicit. ” 5. Students have the option of opting out of anything they want to. They just get penalized for it. 6. Students who have gone through the official steps of seeking accommodations (for dyslexia, ADD, PTSD, etc.) should be respected and accommodated. They are not a burden. Timothy   an associate professor of history at Rutgers: While I don't use trigger warnings in the classroom, I'd be appalled if an administrator at my own institution attempted to dictate to me or my students what they should expect from their instructors with regard to such warnings. It would abrogate my academic freedom as an instructor. In this context, Ellison's words cruelly ignore the recent and devastating history of indifference by University of Chicago administrators to marginalized students' safety. I think the University of Chicago has a fetish of the universal and a hostility toward concepts or ideas that can be construed as “particular. ” (For example, as a graduate student there, I taught a course that at most other institutions would be called “Introduction to LGBT Studies” at Chicago, it is, or at least was, called “Problems in the Study of Sexuality. ”) There is a concomitant sense that the heroic individual scholar can and should engage in the life of the mind, without being embedded in the messy realities of the real world. In its most troubling versions, this leads to a sense on the part of administrators that discrimination and structural oppression can be wished or willed away, or that catering to demands for inclusion would somehow be “coddling. ” This letter about trigger warnings  safe spaces? In my view, it's not at all motivated by actual concern about TWs and safe spaces. Continuing our series of comments from the University of Chicago community regarding Dean John Ellison's letter, some alumni and students have expressed that the move smelled, at least partially, like a publicity stunt. From one current University of Chicago student, who hints that the administration has been trying to change the image of those beloved strange “dark” days of the school I remember so well: To me, the whole situation reads as a poorly conceived publicity stunt. The University is in this strange moment where its undergrad exclusivity has recently shot up, and it seems to want to do everything it can to bolster its reputation. The College also attempting to rebrand through ditching the    masochism tone of prior decades and attempting to court a reputation of Fun, Exciting Academic Rigor. However, this all leaves the College without a coherent identity, and the admins pinned their hopes on riding the   wave of think pieces on the matter, which would allow them to capitalize on dissatisfaction with the Millennial bogeyman's perceived censorship problem, hostility toward the ivory tower, and the massive moderate frustrated by youth movements in general. It certainly doesn't represent any actual policy change: the University has explicitly said that this is not a blanket ban on trigger warnings, but that it still allows professors to choose what to do at their discretion. I have no idea whether it worked. It will have appealed to those forces I mentioned, but of course will also drive away prospective students involved in the   community. From another alum: Have you ever actually had a lesson plan or discussion section disrupted because students claimed they felt “triggered” by the material? Sometimes I find the language and the logic of the “trigger warning” a bit stultifying, but really that's only in the abstract because no one has ever actually invoked it. I can count the number of times a student has asked to take a step back from a set of readings or a specific conversation on one hand, and then it's with ample, generous explanation and always when we were dealing with genuinely disturbing material. I suppose this letter disappoints me because it reads like fairly blatant administrative grandstanding. More insidiously, I am afraid that it will produce the very effects that it claims it is trying to prevent —  the foreclosure of a dialogue between all interested parties. And lastly, an alum questions whether the letter is speaking to the university's community and how consistent the university's administration has been on the issue: I find the letter from U of C to be somewhat embarrassing. On the surface, who can argue with academic freedom? But I take the appeal to it here to be fairly empty posturing and, more importantly, it's part of a pattern of the administration appealing to academic freedom at the same time as —  or in order to —  act badly. When I was an undergrad they were refusing to divest from Darfur because taking a political stance would somehow violate academic freedom. It seemed to me at the time to be a fairly transparent attempt to preserve the status quo and avoid a financial hassle —  and I'm skeptical that divestment was in any way contrary to the famous Kalven Report. And we can add to this the University's treatment of protesters, including those who were agitating for a trauma unit at the hospitals and the more recent threats against the student body president who organized a  . Throw in the   letter that the president just sent, too. Appealing to academic freedom while acting this way may not be acting inconsistently, exactly, but it isn't great. What I take away from all of this is that the administrators don't care about academic freedom. They care about their  . And their interest is in propping up the speech of some and not others. In making their decisions, I have a hard time imagining these administrators sitting around thinking carefully about the meaning of academic freedom in all of its complexity and nuance. That kind of pondering was what my professors taught me at U of C. What I read is a letter with all the nuance and care of a talk radio host. I'm confident that Chicago will continue being a great school with incredible faculty and students doing amazing things. This letter contributes nothing to the quality of the institution —  nor does it detract from it. It's a shadow on the wall of the cave. I wish it had been something worth our time, because these issues do matter. I don't think that trigger warnings and safe spaces are inconsistent with academic freedom —  not in the least. But I don't think that this is about that —  it's just an attempt at branding, as well as ignoring or silencing or marginalizing protest at the University. It sets up those that want the University to act as a better citizen (with respect to its students and the broader community) as  . And while those that protest very well might be wrong —  that's debatable, for sure —  I think the   slant is an insubstantial smear. If we're going to have a   conversation about trigger warnings and safe spaces, then fine. The Dean should write the kind of reasoned, deep treatment of the issues that the U of C community deserves. Yesterday, my colleague, Bourree Lam, looked at how University of Chicago alumni are responding to the   letter their alma mater sent out last week to incoming freshmen. The letter essentially warned students that the university —  which for decades has espoused its commitment to “freedom of expression” —  would not tolerate “intellectual ‘safe spaces'” and “  ‘trigger warnings. '” The thinking behind the letter, presumably, is that safe spaces and trigger warnings inherently suppress free speech and academic freedom —  and, in turn, that the university felt a need to defend those values. As Bourree highlighted yesterday, that premise outraged many alumni, who remember their years at the university as experiences rife with challenging and uncomfortable discussions. Others argued that the wholesale rejection of things like trigger warnings misses the point. It got us thinking: What is a trigger warning, anyway? What defines a safe space? Lots of people have questioned whether Dean of Students John Ellison, who wrote the letter, actually understands what the terms mean. My colleague, Conor Friedersdorf, chimed in on the topic this morning. Here's what some from the academic community had to say. From an alum, Audrey Truschke: I would say that the letter brought up mixed reactions from me. I wholeheartedly support the basic idea that universities ought to have a strong, unflinching commitment to academic freedom of speech, and I think numerous institutions have dangerously compromised that ideal recently. That said, I use trigger warnings periodically on syllabi. I started including them formally, as part of the written syllabus, last year when I realized that I had been doing them informally for years. For me, it always seemed to be common sense that when you find yourself, say, assigning a graphic description of rape, you might give your students a   during the prior class meeting, concerning what they are about to read. Even now, I often issue ”trigger warnings” more informally. For instance, this past spring I sent out a podcast on female genital mutilation to my students with the caveat that they should not listen to it while driving. I had made that mistake, I told them, and nearly had to pull over at one point because it was such a hard listen and brought tears to my eyes. The point of giving due warning, for me, is not to silence debate but rather to prepare people so that they can (hopefully) move beyond their understandable initial reactions of shock, horror, disgust, and trauma and enter into an intellectual discussion of the materials and questions at hand. From another alum, Nabeel Ebeid: More than anything, I'm embarrassed. UChicago taught me to question so many assumptions and helped me to revise so many of my priors with logic and data. For the school to send its undergrads a letter without a clear definition of “safe space” or “trigger warning,” without any reference to sexual assault, harassment, or the contexts in which these words emerged, and without substantiating any link between those terms and academic freedom, Ellison is being lazy at best and, at worst, gratuitously malicious. One need not denigrate safe spaces or trigger warnings to support academic freedom or defend the right to bring controversial speakers to campus. More puzzling is that the school is full of safe spaces: the Center for Identity and Inclusion (Amandla Center in my day) worship groups, any number of campus affinity groups, etc (to say nothing of health counselors' offices). The school appears to endorse them wholeheartedly, and it's hard to imagine a day when it wouldn't. These spaces have provided both vibrant fora for   discussion as well as support systems for the marginalized. In my time at UChicago, they contributed to campus conversation with a wide array of speakers and perspectives that were often underrepresented in the Core. I can't recall a single instance in which these communities stifled free speech. The aversion to trigger warnings seems even stranger. Trigger warnings by definition prepare the reader or listener for triggering content the notion that these warnings stifle speech is unsubstantiated and farfetched. I also wonder how taking a stance against trigger warnings doesn't stifle the free speech of professors who may see value in sensitivity when introducing potentially triggering material. Finally, I wonder what kind of message a note like this sends to community members who may already be wary from recent Title IX investigations. Ellison seems to be reacting viscerally to the feeling that the marginalized have it too easy. If he was concerned about disinviting speakers, he could have said as much. Instead, he chose to bash vaguely   terms without appearing to understand them, and he strung them together into a paragraph of non sequiturs . .. all in the name of freedom. From another alum, Maira Khwaja, who graduated this past June: Dean Ellison misrepresents what trigger warnings and safe spaces have been on our campus, which are often nuanced and personalized for each professor (UChicago is nothing if not nuanced and overly verbose) and syllabi and department and extracurricular. His simplification, misrepresentation, and conflation of trigger     speakers are poor examples of the “rigorous discourse” that he boasts. In our histories of violence class, we did not shy away from any of America's most brutal understudied history, but we were given a thoughtful paragraph on the syllabus about the nature of the images and text we'd read in the archive. It'd be naive and foolish to disregard that thoughtful paragraph from our professor as something other than analysis that contributed to class discussion and understanding. Safe spaces are not made so that students can “retreat” from ideas they don't want to hear in fact, often safe spaces are built in our campus so that they can dive even further, with careful support (like support staff on hand, or respectful mutually made ground rules created) into discussions that would often be too uncomfortable for the classroom. An anonymous alum: I'm very disappointed in this admin at my former school over his nonsense about trigger warnings destroying freedom. And I love that it's a scholar at my current one so splendidly calling him out: As CUNY historian Angus Johnston notes, “There's no college in the country where profs are required to give trigger warnings. They're all voluntary pedagogical choices. Which means a professor's use of trigger warnings isn't a threat to academic freedom. It's a MANIFESTATION of academic freedom. '” Academic freedom means that professors get to design their syllabus, not administrators like Ellison. His letter is a prime example of how the outcry against “political correctness” often leads to policy changes that limit free speech.” Over the past week, my alma mater has been all over my (and probably your) news feed. The general dramatic headline: There will not be safe spaces or trigger warnings at the University of Chicago, according to a letter sent by John Ellison, dean of students at the university, to incoming freshmen. The letter immediately became a dot on the timeline of the ongoing national debate on campus politics, political correctness, and academic freedom —  the media narrative being that an administration takes a stand on free speech and academic freedom, and that's followed swiftly by support and pushback from students, experts, and pundits. I went to the University of Chicago for undergrad in the early 2000s. I studied economics and sociology, and I have very fond memories of the school's peculiar culture: the way students laughed off the bitter winters, the way pulling   at the library (shoutout to the  ) was cool, the super weird school traditions like Scavhunt —  so strange that The NYer once devoted nearly 4, 000 words to it. It's a place where people knowingly enrolled even though they've been told it's a place “where fun comes to die. ” I think we took pride in the image that we were young people who wanted to participate in school that was intellectually rigorous (the “life of the mind”) where a class about Nabokov's Lolita or Foucault's History of Sexuality were so popular it was hard to find a seat, where education was its own end, and everyone was a bit odd in their own way. I think my peers and I worried that culture (beloved by us) was starting to fade when I graduated in 2007: The school had switched from the UnCommon App to the Common App. The school started to rise in rankings, which was favorable for alumni   but we worried that it was at the cost of the school's identity and the students it would attract. The University of Chicago is about hard classes, but it's also about community.   In NY, where I live now, alumni are often   friend groups —  my    spouse regularly laments that he knows more alumni from the U of C than his own university —  that meet up regularly to have discussions not dissimilar to classes. (It's also interesting to note that some 20 percent of U of C alumni end up in academia.) With Ellison's letter, we all pondered what it's going to mean, and we did that together online. This week, I'm going to highlight some of the interesting discussions I've seen on social media and responses from the University of Chicago community. My colleague Alia Wong will join me in discussing these comments from students and alumni who share deep connections to the school and each other. For them, Ellison's letter is personal, in contrast to the way the national debate on campus politics can sometimes feel removed. From one alum, Laura Oppenheimer: I take an inordinate amount of pride in how hard I worked as a student at the U of C. My courses were not dumbed down, no one held my hand, and I was expected to read, grapple with, and discuss everything —  ranging from Plato and Marx, to Four Hours in My Lai and Night. The reading was difficult, and frequently, so was the subject matter. What I wish Ellison had said was, “as students at the University of Chicago, you will be expected to read, study and discuss many types of work, including work that may be upsetting, or work you may disagree with. This is part of a rigorous, academic education. ” Instead, he issued a blanket statement that the school doesn't give trigger warnings, which are something that serve to protect those who may have PTSD due to past trauma. To me, despite the way trigger warnings have been   by overly sensitive college students, this was a misstep. I applaud the ethos, but I wish the administration had refined the message and made it about free speech and academic discourse, focusing more on the message it was trying to deliver, and less on grabbing a moment in the spotlight. From another alum: As a 2006 graduate, I have to say I completely support Ellison's letter 100 percent.  It really surprised me a lot because I didn't expect the University to go that far in support of true free speech, since free speech is not very popular these days, especially on college campuses.  But I am very glad (and proud) that the University took such a position.  I hope that they stick to it.  (Though as an aside, I also wonder how many people are hearing about the University for the very first time because of this letter —  and to what extent that is a good thing or a bad thing.) A particularly insightful Facebook post from alum Nasia Anam: I don't think it would be a stretch to call University of Chicago a school of intellectual hard knocks. This has always been the unarticulated social contract of matriculating at U of C —  the place that attracts kids who proudly don   emblazoned with the motto “Where Fun Comes to Die,” and [where] the   winter break is unofficially known as “Suicide Prevention Day. ”   …     But a wholesale dismissal of “trigger warnings” and “safe spaces” as flimsy excuses for coddled millennials to continue lives of comfort, puppies, and   (not Plato!   to) is simultaneously a refusal to acknowledge an extremely problematic stance on student mental health. Clinical depression is not a prerequisite in the life of the mind, and being   by class material does not facilitate “freedom of inquiry and expression” but, quite to the contrary, precludes and damages a fruitful learning process. To make students uncomfortable, to create friction and tension in the classroom, lecture hall, auditorium, etc. —  these are invaluable pedagogical tools. Asking students to exacerbate existing pain, trauma, or mental disturbance or enter spaces where they feel endangered or ashamed does absolutely nothing for the honorable pursuit of  . . .. My problem with the letter is not that it raises the issues of “trigger warnings” and “safe spaces” as dubious, but the unnecessarily harsh tone it takes. There is an underlying   assumption that incoming freshmen (legal adults, I might add) will not be able, of their own accord, to determine what may or may not be traumatic for them. Traumatic. Not disturbing, not unsettling. Traumatic. Trauma is a   psychological condition, and the fact that the letter gives it absolutely no credence gives the impression to incoming undergraduates that their mental health is not an issue that needs or warrants any attention whatsoever.   …     We should put pressure upon the concept of “trigger warnings” and “safe spaces,” yes. We should be vigilant about the ways these accommodative practices are abused. But to completely dismiss these pedagogical caveats as   psychobabble hooha is not only retrograde, it is contra to the aims of an administration that ostensibly seeks a more diverse population of students. Free expression and inquiry can by its very nature only occur in spaces where all individuals understand themselves to be equally free. Hostile and punitive classroom environments do not facilitate this goal. We should be debating and complicating the ideas of “trigger warnings” and ”safe spaces,” not dismissing them.

Trump's Immigration Policy: After two weeks of uncertainty about his stance on immigration, Trump went back to the hardline policies he'd campaigned on during the primaries in a speech on Wednesday, repeating that he'd enact mass deportations, build a wall on the southern U. S. border, and make Mexico pay for it. In response, members of his Hispanic Advisory Council are reportedly stepping down. And yet, asks David Frum, is Trump's immigration policy —  insofar as it prioritizes American interests —  really so shocking? A Tactical Error? Just how effective a protest is refusing to stand for the national anthem? Colin Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback who sat to protest police brutality, is facing intense criticism over his choice —  and as Peter Beinart points out, his statement could have been better heard if he hadn't appeared to reject the anthem. But Garrett Epps, citing a 1940 Supreme Court case over a mandatory flag salute, argues that Americans should be wary of paying too much reverence to national symbols. The Thin Blue Line: David Brown, the chief of police of Dallas, Texas, has announced his retirement after 33 years on the force. Brown became a national figure when a gunman killed five Dallas police officers in July in the aftermath of the shootings, the police chief called on the city to “stop this divisiveness between our police and our citizens. ” There's more evidence of that divide today in Atlanta, Georgia, where a former officer has been indicted for murder after shooting an unarmed black man, Deravis Caine Rogers, on June 22. But meanwhile, in Camden, New Jersey, police officer Cabria Bell sees her    job as simply to serve the community. “Yes, I wear this badge,” says Bell, “[but] behind all of this I am still somebody's daughter, somebody's spouse. I'm still a human [and] my job as an officer is to be here for you. ” Read the full interview here. Asher Elbein on the American   artist Jack Kirby: He drew monster comics, romance comics (a genre he had a hand in creating) westerns, and science fiction. In 1940, he and his fellow artist Joe Simon created Captain America. In 1961, he and Stan Lee collaborated on Fantastic Four, the first modern Marvel superhero comic. It was the start of a partnership that produced a pantheon of characters: Thor,   and the Wasp, The Hulk, Iron Man, Black Panther, The Fantastic Four and Doctor Doom, The Inhumans and the   and far too many others to name. The Marvel comics universe and its accompanying blockbuster films simply would not exist without the   Jack Kirby. . .. Marvel's “Kirby Week” covers all of this in glowing fashion. But the articles all gloss neatly over the other side of the story: namely, the fact that Marvel fought a   battle to keep Kirby from claiming creative and financial control over his creations, culminating in a legal dustup with his heirs that very nearly landed in front of the Supreme Court. The story of Kirby's struggle with Marvel is also one of the most public examples of the lengths to which even the greatest of creators had to go in order to get credit —  and compensation —  for his work.

One reader writes: The   aspect of a church community is something I have always relished. A church is one of the few places where those over 70 and people in their 20s, 30s, and younger who aren't related (important!) mix on a very regular basis. In addition, because it is a place where you go frequently and often share very personal information, it is a good place to meet —  and get to become friends with —  a diverse group of people.

On this day in 1914, the last known passenger pigeon died in captivity after the birds were hunted into extinction in the late 19th century. As John Burroughs wrote in our April 1918 issue: In my boyhood the vast armies of the passenger pigeons were one of the most notable spring tokens. Often late in March, or early in April, the naked   would suddenly become blue with them, and vocal with their soft,   calls or all day the sky would be streaked with the long lines or dense masses of the moving armies.   …     But that spectacle was never repeated as it had been for generations before. The pigeons never came back. Death and destruction, in the shape of the greed and cupidity of man, were on their trail.   …     The last time that my eyes beheld a passenger pigeon was in the fall of 1876 when I was out for grouse. I saw a solitary cock sitting in a tree. I killed it, little dreaming that, so far as I was concerned, I was killing the last pigeon.

Please follow the steps below, Russian President Vladimir Putin has yet to meet with new British Prime Minister Theresa May, but he did find time for a     with 11 students from one of Britain's most expensive boarding schools, Eton College. The students from the renowned   school were photographed at the Kremlin, shaking hands with Putin and sitting with him around a table. The Telegraph reported Wednesday that the meeting was believed to have “been set up by a Russian bishop after he gave a talk at the Berkshire college in March. ” It's not clear exactly when the meeting took place. The newspaper also wrote that one of the boys, David Wei, said he organized the trip to “improve relations between the West and Russia. ” Wei reportedly wrote on Facebook: Guys, we truly gave Putin a deep impression of us and he responded by showing us his human face. ” An Eton spokeswoman told The Telegraph the trip was in no way connected with the school. “This was a private visit by a small group of boys organised entirely at their own initiative and independently of the College,” she said. The Kremlin has declined to comment, according to the newspaper. Some of the boys shared their Kremlin experience on social media. Trenton Bricken, who, per his Facebook page, just started college at Duke University, shared on August 24 this photo, captioned, “Two hour meeting with President Putin. He was small in person but not in presence. ” The Sun spoke to a “source close to the students,” who said the boys “went last week” and “didn't tell anyone they were going, I would assume it was so the school didn't find out because I don't think they would be happy. ” The source said: From what I understand, they were talking to him about Eton because he had a keen interest in the college, mainly due to previous politicians in the UK who had attended. After they got home, the boys posted the pictures to social media, which I thought was strange because it looked like they had been trying to keep it quiet previously. Wei's hopes —  that the meeting would “improve relations between the West and Russia” —  likely won't be realized. But at least the boys got some cool photos out of it.

Please follow the steps below, NEWS BRIEF The Syrian Ministry of Tourism released a new promotional video of the coastal city of Tartus, featuring its expansive Mediterranean coastline, packed beaches, and lush green landscapes.   But the video fails to capture one thing: the country's   civil war. The     video titled “Syria —  Always Beautiful,” set to an upbeat remix of Alan Walker's “Faded,” was one of many videos posted to the ministry's YouTube page in recent weeks in an apparent effort to entice tourists to visit areas of the   country still under the control of President Bashar  's regime. Although the aerial footage of the bustling beach town gives viewers a sense of Syria's   tourism industry —  the country welcomed 8. 5 million visitors in 2010 —   it provides a stark contrast to what Tartus has since become. Five years into the civil war, which has claimed the lives of almost half a million people and displaced millions, the city has been bombarded by the ISIS, including an attack that killed 150 people and wounded 200 others in May. Local Syrian news outlet   News notes that the coastal enclave depicted in the video has been “virtually been untouched by the war. ” But such assurances are unlikely to convince the numerous countries that have issued travel warnings to their citizens asking them to avoid visiting the country. “No part of Syria should be considered safe from violence,” the U. S. State Department says on its website. “The potential for hostile acts exists throughout the country, including kidnappings and the use of chemical warfare against civilians. ” Prior to the start of the civil war, foreign tourism accounted for 14 percent of Syria's gross domestic product, Bloomberg reports. The country was a popular tourist destination for its numerous historic monuments, many of which have been designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. One tourist spot, the city of Palmyra, saw many of its ancient ruins destroyed by ISIS militants this year. 	A bartender's camera captures the seedy street life of retro NY."

Please follow the steps below, NEWS BRIEF Penn State plans to honor former football coach Joe Paterno, who was fired in 2011 after his former assistant coach was arrested for sexually abusing young boys, at a football game this month. According to the football program's promotional calendar, the September 17 game will include a “commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Coach Joe Paterno. ” Paterno's first game as head coach was September 17, 1966. The announcement prompted outrage on social media. Joe Paterno, who died in January 2012 at age 85, served as head football coach for 46 years and was considered a beacon of integrity in the   world of NCAA football. But that changed in 2011, when it was revealed Paterno helped cover up years of child sex abuse by his assistant coach. In November 2011, Jerry Sandusky, who left his Penn State coaching position in 1999, was arrested and charged with dozens of counts of sexual abuse of young boys from 1994 to 2009. Paterno and Penn State's president were fired days later. According to an investigation of the abuse, the beloved “Joe Pa” knew that Sandusky had sexually assaulted boys and did not report him. Court documents unsealed in July revealed that the abuse was reported to Paterno as early as 1976, but the coach took no action. Sandusky was convicted in 2012 and is currently serving 30 to 60 years in state prison. 	A bartender's camera captures the seedy street life of retro NY."

Please follow the steps below, NEWS BRIEF Dallas Police Chief David Brown, who helped guide the city after a gunman killed five law enforcement officers last month during protests against fatal police shootings, announced his retirement Thursday. “Serving the citizens of Dallas in this noble profession has been both a true honor and a humbling experience,” Brown said in a statement. The   veteran of the city's police department said he will leave the job October 22. He also offered a tribute to the slain officers: Let's always remember the fallen officers including the five officers on July 7, 2016, and the brave men and women of the Dallas Police Department for their sacrifices to keep Dallas safe.  Their memory will remain with all of us forever.  I know the people of Dallas will never forget the ultimate sacrifice they made on the streets of our city that awful night. Brown became a recognizable figure in national news after Micah Johnson, a    black man, fatally shot five officers in Dallas during a protest against recent police killings of black men. Before he was killed by police, Johnson told officers he was upset by the fatal shootings of  Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castille in Minnesota, and had specifically targeted white members of law enforcement. On the morning after the shootings, Brown gave a press conference calling for unity. “We're hurting. Our profession is hurting. Dallas officers are hurting. We are heartbroken. There are no words to describe the atrocity that occurred to our city,” Brown, who is black, said. “All I know is this: This must stop, this divisiveness between our police and our citizens. ” In the days after the shooting, Brown also spoke repeatedly about the need for police reform, stricter federal gun laws, and more resources for police departments across the country. According to The Washington Post, during a briefing on July 11 Brown said: We're asking cops to do too much in this country. We are. Every societal failure, we put it off on the cops to solve. Not enough mental health funding, let the cops handle it.   …     Here in Dallas we got a loose dog problem let's have the cops chase loose dogs. Schools fail, let's give it to the cops.   …     That's too much to ask. Policing was never meant to solve all those problems. Brown addressed protesters' perception of police as biased, too. He said, per NPR: We're in a much better place than we were when I was a young man here, but we have much work to do, particularly in our profession. Leaders in my position need to put their careers on the line to make sure we do things    be so worried about keeping their job. That's how I approach it. I hope that's an example for others to approach, the way we conduct ourselves as police officers. He called on those protesting police practices to join the force themselves, saying, “We're hiring. Get off that protest line and put an application in. We'll put you in your neighborhood, and we will help you resolve some of the problems you're protesting about.” Brown's life was marked by tragedy long before the Dallas police shootings. Brown's son fatally shot two men in 2010, one of whom was a police officer, and then was shot and killed by other officers. More than two decades earlier, in 1988, Brown's police academy classmate and former partner Walter Williams was shot and killed while on duty. Brown's younger brother, Kelvin Brown, was killed in Phoenix by drug dealers three years later, according to the Dallas Morning News. Brown said Thursday the decision to retire “difficult” and thanked the city for the opportunity to serve. “I became a Dallas cop in 1983 because of the crack cocaine epidemic's impact on my neighborhood in Oak Cliff. I wanted to be part of the solution,” he said. “Since that time I have taken great pride in knowing that we have always been part of the solution and helped to make Dallas the world class city it is today. ” 	A bartender's camera captures the seedy street life of retro NY."
58416,80097,Clinton Has a Lot of Money,Atlantic,Russell Berman,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, If Clinton loses in November, it won't be for lack of money. The Clinton campaign announced on Thursday that the Democratic nominee raised a total of $143 million in August for her campaign and the national and state Democratic parties. Those accounts begin September with a combined $152 million in the bank. By any measure, that is an enormous amount of cash. Her haul in August is more than 50 percent higher than both the total that Clinton raised in July and that Obama, himself a prodigious fundraiser, collected during the same period four years ago. It also all but ensures that Clinton will maintain her considerable money advantage over Trump, who began far behind after not mounting a traditional fundraising operation during the Republican primaries. Trump, who collected $82 million for his campaign and the Republicans during a strong showing in July, has not released his numbers for August. Clinton has now raised more than $400 million during her presidential run. Will Trump Hand State Capitols to Democrats? What may be most significant about Clinton's total, however, is not the $62 million she raised for her own campaign but the $81 million she took in for the Democratic National Committee and state parties. That portion dwarfs what Obama and Mitt Romney raised for their parties during this period four years ago. And it signals an aggressive effort by Clinton to extend her coattails far down the ballot as Democrats try to take back control of Congress, governorships, and state legislative chambers that they lost during the Obama era. “Trump's divisive rhetoric continues to drive voters away from him and the Republicans and has created new opportunities for Democrats up and down the ticket,” Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, said in a statement. “These resources will help us to register and turnout millions of voters to elect progressive candidates across the country. ” Money for the state parties typically goes to turnout operations on the ground, adding to the advantage that Democrats have over Trump, who has opened relatively few field offices and is relying heavily on the organizing efforts of the Republican National Committee. Clinton is dominating Trump in the number of television ads she's run, and her early fundraising strength allowed her to reserve air time for the fall at lower rates than Trump will be able to get in the campaign's final stretch. Riding a wave of strong poll numbers after the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, Clinton devoted a big part of the month to fundraising. She held fewer campaign events than Trump and attended dozens of   events. Her campaign said more than 2. 7 million people have now contributed to her bid, but the focus on   donors has raised the average contribution to $50 —  nearly twice the $27 average that Bernie Sanders famously boasted about during his primary run. If the goal was simply to bring in a lot of cash, however, Clinton's announcement on Thursday suggests her August fundraising push paid off.

58417,80098,Trump's Immigration Speech Backfires Among Hispanic Republicans,Atlantic,Priscilla Alvarez,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, Trump's hard turn on immigration in a speech in Arizona on Wednesday has sparked a sense of betrayal among members of  his Hispanic Advisory Council, who had hoped to see a more compassionate approach to immigration. “We will build a great wall along the southern border. And Mexico will pay for the wall,” Trump said. He added: “Within ICE I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice just like Clinton has evaded justice, OK?” God vs. the Federal Election Commission, Former Trump Hispanic Adviser and a member of the council Jacob Monty resigned shortly after the Arizona speech. “I was a strong supporter of Trump when I believed he was going to address the immigration problem realistically and compassionately,” he said, according to Politico. “What I heard today was not realistic and not compassionate. ” Politico also reported that Alfonso Aguilar, the president of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, had not yet reached a decision about stepping down from the group, but conceded: “We feel misled. ” Tony Suarez, the executive vice president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference and member of Trump's Evangelical advisory board, said in an interview, “I have more questions than I do answers,” in light of Wednesday's speech. Late last month Trump met with his new National Hispanic Advisory Council to solicit advice from Hispanic leaders. During the gathering the Republican nominee signaled that he might soften his approach on immigration. But days later, the initiative appears to have flopped, with several members of the council venting frustrations with the nominee and reportedly reconsidering their involvement with the group. The news comes only a day after Trump made a   trip to Mexico to meet with the country's president, Enrique Peña Nieto. Trump's harsh stance on immigration, a cornerstone of his presidential campaign, wavered in recent days, creating confusion about his position altogether. Trump and Peña Nieto's news conference in Mexico City on Wednesday did little to remedy that. For one, neither of the two men elaborated on who would pay for the border wall. “We didn't discuss it,” Trump said, when asked —   —  but Peña Nieto later said in a statement that he told Trump Mexico would not pay for the wall. Trump has long said that Mexico would foot the bill. Despite what appeared to be a cordial meeting, Trump reverted back to his regular immigration points in Arizona Wednesday night: Mexico would pay for the wall, pledged mass deportations, and said there would be “no amnesty. ” Leslie Sanchez reported a number of Trump's Hispanic advisory board planned to step down on Thursday: Hispanic leader who advises Trump camp telling me half of Trump's Hispanic advisory board is ready to resign today (15 of 30) She later posted a revision, saying the group “never had more than 23 members. ” Suarez said that members of the Hispanic advisory board felt “really disappointed. ” “They're not at a place that they can continue (to support Trump) and I respect it,” he said. “They don't see any hope after yesterday's speech. ” The resignation rumors are only the latest sign of the Republicans's troubles with outreach to Latinos. The head of Hispanic media relations at the Republican National Committee, Ruth Guerra, resigned earlier this year because, according to The NY Times, she felt “uncomfortable” working for Trump. And in Florida, Wadi Gaitan, who led the communications department for the state's Republican party, stepped down to join the LIBRE Initiative.  Trump's divisive rhetoric about Hispanics and immigration poses a conundrum for Hispanic Republicans, who may support a more hawkish border stance but are finding it difficult to grapple with Trump's rhetoric about the Hispanic community. The Republican nominee has struggled to woo minority voters time and time again —  an impediment to the Republicans which pledged in its 2012 autopsy report to put more emphasis on Hispanic voters. Polling shows 24 percent of Hispanic registered voters support Trump, leaving him slightly behind Mitt Romney's 27 percent support in 2012. This could hurt Trump most in battleground states like Florida, which has an increasingly diverse electorate. To be sure, immigration is one of the top issues concerning Hispanic voters, among jobs and the economy and education. But rather than reaching out to Latino voters, Trump's approach to immigration has left his Latino supporters so insulted that many of them are no longer willing to back his campaign.

Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, The Federal Election Commission has a few questions for God, Satan, and the Ghost of Ronald Reagan, all of whom have filed paperwork to run for office this election cycle. How Colin Kaepernick's Protest Misfired, This implausible scenario is part of a policy aimed at dealing with an influx of   presidential candidate names. It's relatively easy to register as a presidential candidate, and during the 2016 election plenty of people seem to be taking advantage of that. As a result, the federal agency is now asking whoever filed paperwork to run for president under the names “God,” “Satan,” and “Ronald Reagan's Ghost” to prove they actually exist. “It has come to the attention of the Federal Election Commission that you may have failed to include an accurate candidate name,” a letter sent by the commission to “H. Majesty Satan Lord of Underworld Prince of Darkness!” in College Station, Texas dated August 31, 2016 reads. “The Commission requires the filing to be true, correct and complete,” the letter warns, adding that “knowingly and willfully making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation to a federal government agency, including the Federal Election Commission, is punishable. ” A wide array of individuals listed as presidential candidates in the agency directory don't seem like they could possibly be real. To name a few: Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker,   Picard, Captain Crunch, Queen Elsa, and Francis Underwood. Several of these supposed candidates have received letters asking for proof of existence. It's one thing for a federal agency to demand proof of existence from a fictional character. Asking God and Satan to prove that they are real seems far more metaphysical. ”This election cycle has seen a huge increase in the number of fake presidential candidates filing paperwork with the FEC,” said Brett Kappel, a   lawyer and partner in the Washington, D. C. office of Akerman LLP. ”In previous election cycles the FEC would get a few dozen such filings.  This cycle they have received hundreds.” It's hard to say how much time and effort the agency wastes sifting through paperwork intended as a prank. Broadly speaking, the FEC is tasked with regulating money in politics, a responsibility that includes looking into and, in theory, taking action when campaign finance violations occur. But the agency is often criticized as relatively toothless. Agency commissioner Ann Ravel has even gone so far as to say that the agency is “worse than dysfunctional. ” God, Satan and Ronald Reagan's Ghost have 30 days to respond with proof of their existence, or their candidacy will be removed from the agency website. “If the information you submitted   …     is, to the best of your knowledge and belief, true, correct, and complete, please file a response to confirm this,” the letter to Satan Lord of Underworld Prince of Darkness reads. “Failure to respond within 30 calendar days of the date of this correspondence will result in the Commission removing your FEC Form 2 and related committee filings. ” What else do we know about these elusive candidates? “God” originally registered as a Republican. Satan also opted to register as a Republican. Ronald Reagan's Ghost meanwhile is registered as an Independent. Trump often talks up the fact that he's a political outsider, but it's hard to imagine what could be more of an outsider than being undead, a deity, or a devil.

The tremor occurred 19 miles beneath the ocean about 103 miles northeast of the city of Gisborne, according to the U. S. Geological Survey. New Zealand's Ministry of Civil Defense said there was a “potential tsunami threat” after the quake, a common warning in Pacific countries after a major seismic event. There is a potential tsunami threat for New Zealand following the 7m earthquake near Te Araroa at 4. 38NZ time today. #eqnz,  New Zealand is still recovering from a 6.  quake that struck off the coast of Christchurch in 2011, killing 185 people and devastating the city's infrastructure. While Friday's earthquake is stronger than the 2011 temblor, it was also deeper beneath the ocean crust and further from land, making similar levels of damage unlikely. This is a developing story and we'll update as we learn more. 	A bartender's camera captures the seedy street life of retro NY."
58420,80101,How Colin Kaepernick's Protest Misfired,Atlantic,Peter Beinart,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, I admire Colin Kaepernick. I admire his courage in doing what he thinks is right even though it could cost him money and perhaps his job. You don't see that from public figures very often. I admire him for raising awareness about police brutality. I also admire the veterans who have defended him by arguing, correctly, that they are defending his right to sit or stand when the national anthem plays. That's what living in a free country means. God vs. the Federal Election Commission, But it's one thing to defend Kaepernick's right to protest and to applaud his outrage over   racism. It's another to believe that his particular form of protest is wise. Throughout American history, the most effective protests have embraced American symbols and demanded that America's government live up to the ideals those symbols are supposed to represent. As the early   socialist Norman Thomas famously advised his fellow radicals, “Don't burn the flag, wash it. ” Sitting for the national anthem is like burning the flag. By rejecting a core national symbol, you're symbolically rejecting the nation itself. You're implying that America is impervious to reform, corrupt and evil at its core. That's different than going on TV to denounce police violence or donning an “I Can't Breathe”   on the court like LeBron James. Professional football players occupy an unusual place in American society because the NFL is one of the few institutions that are embraced equally by Americans on both sides of the partisan divide. Since 1994, according to the Pew Research Center, the percentage of Democrats and Republicans who hold “strongly negative” views of the other party has more than doubled. And this partisan alienation increasingly structures how Americans live. As the Washington Post's Aaron Blake puts it, Americans are “gerrymandering themselves” along ideological lines. Liberals choose smaller houses in diverse urban areas where there's lots of opportunity to walk. Conservatives choose bigger houses in small towns or rural areas where neighbors share their religious faith. The sorting isn't only geographic. Studies show that liberals eat at Au Bon Pain and California Pizza Kitchen. Conservatives favor Cracker Barrel and Whataburger. Democrats buy their groceries at Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, Republicans at Randall's. Democrats don't just watch MSNBC. They also watch Comedy Central and Bravo. Conservatives don't just watch Fox News. They also watch Country Music Television and the motor   Speed Channel. Even the reaction to Hollywood action movies can break down along partisan lines. Earlier this year, when Columbia Pictures' remake of Ghostbusters featured an   cast of heroes, the   declared war on the film, and progressives rallied to its defense. As Bill Bishop, author of The Big Sort, writes, “We've built a country where we can all choose the neighborhood and church and news   compatible with our lifestyle and beliefs. And we are living with the consequences of this    segregation. Our country has become so polarized, so ideologically inbred, that people don't know and can't understand those who live just a few miles away. ” Professional sports, and especially professional football, represent an exception to this trend. Put a liberal Democrat and a conservative Republican in a room, especially if they're men, and ask them to find a shared cultural vocabulary and they're likely to start discussing the NFL. Soccer may be more popular among liberals, golf and auto racing among conservatives. But with its mass appeal, the NFL overwhelms these ideological distinctions. Monday Night Football may be the 21st century's closest equivalent to Walter Cronkite. I'm not suggesting that in order to keep the NFL nonpartisan, professional football players should never express a political thought. To the contrary, athletes —  especially African American athletes —  have a unique opportunity to use the prestige they enjoy with conservative white Americans to make those Americans face racism and injustice. If you're a Donald   Rush   Republican in the Denver suburbs, it's a lot easier to demonize and disregard Obama than Von Miller. But that makes it all the more important that athletes speak in a way that can be heard. Khizr Khan's speech at the Democratic Convention was so effective because he claimed America's symbols —  the Constitution, Arlington National Cemetery, his son's military sacrifice —  and accused Trump of disrespecting them with his   bigotry. Colin Kaepernick, by contrast, is exposing himself to the charge of disrespect. I don't doubt his motives or his courage. But tactically, there's a better way.

Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, This might be hard to believe, but over the next two months of cinema releases, there's not one superhero in sight. Sure, there are a couple remakes, a   sequel, and even an attempt to start a   franchise, but the fall movie season looks to be a distinct improvement from the summer. So far, 2016 has been a mixed year for Hollywood: While dollar revenues are steady thanks to inflation and 3D upcharges, actual ticket sales are at their lowest rate in history, and a   summer of   franchise flops and sequels did nothing to help that. The question now is whether a slate of literary adaptations,   recreations, and yes, eventually a   superhero (hello, Doctor Strange!) will be enough to drive audience interest. The fall kicks off with the stodgiest   of them all, Clint Eastwood's Sully (September 9) a stirring drama that sees Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) land a plane on the Hudson River after catastrophic engine failure, then suffer through a press conference or two. It's the kind of true story that typically appeals in awards season, but outside of the plane crash itself, there's not a whole lot of drama to this one. (Put it this way: There's a reason it's only one hour and 35 minutes long.) The true stories keep coming with Snowden (September 16) Oliver Stone's take on a more exciting figure in recent history, the former NSA contractor and whistleblower (Joseph  ). Stone hasn't had a hit in years, but in theory, the conspiratorial nature of Snowden's story should fit his milieu perfectly. The rest of September is a mixed bag of nostalgia. Bridget Jones's Baby (September 16) is a    third entry in the Bridget Jones saga, with Renee Zellweger returning to the big screen for the first time in six years to choose between Colin Firth and Patrick Dempsey. Blair Witch (September 16) is a   to the 1999 horror phenomenon that sees the brother of poor Heather Donohue (hers was the tearful face that became synonymous with The Blair Witch Project) trying to find her in the woods. The Magnificent Seven (September 23) is a new take on the classic Western (and, in turn, the Kurosawa classic Seven Samurai) this time starring Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, and Ethan Hawke as a ragtag group of cowboys enlisted to save a town from evildoers. Antoine Fuqua, who has updated King Arthur and The Equalizer with mixed results, directs. It's not just a month of nostalgia for old hit movies, though. Deepwater Horizon (September 30) takes viewers all the way back to the halcyon days of 2010 and the disastrous oil rig explosion that led to one of the worst environmental disasters in history. It's directed by Peter Berg (Friday Night Lights, Lone Survivor) who excels at tales of   folk doing gritty work, and stars Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, and John Malkovich. In lighter fare, there's Disney's Queen of Katwe (September 23) a sports biography about the Ugandan chess prodigy Phiona Mutesi (played by the newcomer Madina Nalwanga) David Oyelowo and Lupita Nyong'o  . Andrea Arnold's American Honey (September 30) a   road trip drama starring Shia LaBeouf and Riley Keough, has drawn raves for its energetic style and won the Cannes Jury Prize. Finally, Tim Burton adapts the   series Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (September 30) in a play for a new Harry   franchise, this one starring Eva Green as the headmistress of a school of magical youngsters. In October, Oscar season really kicks off with the debut of Nate Parker's The Birth of a Nation (October 7) a retelling of Nat Turner's 1831 slave rebellion that drew plaudits at the Sundance Film Festival and was acquired by Fox Searchlight for a record $17. 5 million. (The film's buzz has since been overshadowed by the horrifying details of a past rape allegation against Parker.) The adaptation of the novel The Girl on the Train (October 7) starring Emily Blunt, seems to be aiming for viewers who enjoyed the similarly thrilling Gone Girl, but can the director Tate Taylor (The Help) bring the same kind of artistry to a hit potboiler that David Fincher did two years ago? Meanwhile, Ben Affleck has moved on to an even darker role in The Accountant (October 14) where he plays an autistic math savant who keeps the books of dangerous criminal organizations, and gets caught up in a web of intrigue. Gavin O'Connor (Warrior, Jane Got a Gun) directs. Tom Cruise continues his career reinvention (one in which he only appears in reliable action sequels) with Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (October 21) which will suffer from the loss of Werner Herzog, such an oddly compelling villain in the 2012 original. Ewan McGregor is also making a play for reinvention, but as a writer and director, adapting one of Philip Roth's greatest novels, American Pastoral (October 21) and starring as “Swede” Levov, a Jewish businessman whose daughter Merry (Dakota Fanning) is drawn into a frightening world of   radicalism. The promising young American director Barry Jenkins, who made the underseen delight Medicine for Melancholy, has drawn raves for Moonlight (October 21) a drama about a gay, young African American man trying to find his place in the world. The acclaimed Korean director Park   whose foray into Hollywood was the appealing thriller Stoker, is back in his homeland with The Handmaiden (October 21) an erotic psychological thriller set in the 1930s. If you're looking for sillier fare, there's always Inferno (October 28) where Dan Brown's heroic cryptologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) tries to unravel yet another medieval conspiracy, this time in Florence, Italy. It's possible the director Ron Howard and Hanks just wanted to take a vacation to the Mediterranean, but the film looks set to make a fortune worldwide no matter what. Come November, audiences will get a Marvel superhero in the form of Doctor Strange (November 4) starring Benedict Cumberbatch as the trippy sorcerer supreme, which promises to be slightly darker fare thanks to its fall release date and its director, the   vet Scott Derrickson. Mel Gibson is attempting another comeback with Hacksaw Ridge (November 4) a World War II drama about the conscientious objector and Medal of Honor winner Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield). Gibson has always been a thrilling director of action, but it remains to be seen whether that will be enough for audiences to put aside his long and checkered history. Another major Oscar player dropping that week is Jeff Nichols's   drama Loving (November 4) about the plaintiffs in the 1967 Supreme Court case that legalized interracial marriage around the country the film, starring Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga, drew warm praise at Cannes. It seems every    director these days tries to make a   drama (Nichols, in fact, did so just this year with Midnight Special). For Denis Villeneuve, who's made his mark with dramas like Prisoners and Sicario, that's Arrival (November 11) an   work starring Amy Adams about a linguist trying to communicate with a mysterious race of aliens. Perhaps just as ambitious is Ang Lee's Iraq War epic Billy Flynn's Long Halftime Walk (November 11) an adaptation of Ben Fountain's   novel that was shot in an unprecedented 120 frames per second (the usual speed is 24). That should give it an unusual visual pop if nothing else, something Lee (whose last film was Life of Pi) excels at. Perhaps the biggest Oscar player of all is Kenneth Lonergan's Manchester by the Sea (November 18) a sober family drama starring Casey Affleck and Kyle Chandler that drew acclaim at Sundance, where it premiered out of competition and was picked up by Amazon. Finally, as Thanksgiving rolls around, the franchises fire up again, including the Harry   which has been dormant since the release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 in 2011. No longer, with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (November 18) an original script by J. K. Rowling set in her wizarding world, but this time in 1920s NY. Will Eddie Redmayne's Newt Scamander inspire as much devotion as The Boy Who Lived? Let's hope, since Fantastic Beasts is the first of a trilogy. Disney is also releasing its original musical Moana (November 23) a Pacific   adventure starring Dwayne Johnson as the legendary Polynesian demigod Maui alongside the newcomer Auli'i Cravalho maybe as big a draw is the original music from   Miranda. Thanksgiving also brings Allied (November 23) a romantic thriller from Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Back to the Future) set in World War II and starring Brad Pitt as an assassin who falls for a spy played by Marion Cotillard.

Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, RIO DE JANEIRO —  On August 31, Brazil made the end of 13 years of Worker's Party (PT) rule official. By a count of   the senate voted to impeach Dilma Rousseff, the country's first female president, for manipulating the federal budget to conceal deficits. Rousseff's opponents viewed Wednesday's news as an indictment of her disastrous management of the economy, and as a necessary change amid the massive corruption scandal surrounding   oil company Petrobras. But her supporters have labelled her impeachment a “parliamentary coup,” since many of the very politicians supporting the charges against her have been officially implicated in the Petrobras probe, unlike Rousseff herself. The PT leaves behind a mixed legacy, as well as substantial pockets of support for its progressive social policies, particularly among the poor. The party's investments in infrastructure, its university   policies, and Bolsa Família, its popular   program that offered financial assistance to needy families, helped boost its standing among the working class, even as the   tide crested in recent months. An April poll by the group DataFolha found 47 percent of Brazilians in the country's lowest income bracket (a  family income of up to roughly $540 U. S. dollars per month) said Rousseff's predecessor, PT   Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, was the best president Brazil ever had. The End of Dilma Rousseff's Presidency, After the vote, Rousseff defiantly slammed her impeachment as a sexist, homophobic, racist coup. She also addressed those who had vaulted into the middle class during the country's     boom years. “I'm speaking principally to the Brazilians who, during my government, overcame misery, accomplished the dream of having their own house, started to get medical attention, entered into university, and stopped being invisible in the eyes of the nation, moving toward having rights that were always denied them,” she said. “We accomplished, with success, a project that brought about the biggest social inclusion and reduction of inequalities in the history of the country. ” As Rousseff's odds of escaping impeachment dwindled, Rocinha, the largest favela in Rio, resigned itself to the reality of life under the government of the     Michel Temer, Rousseff's replacement and former vice president, who many residents I spoke to fear will erode labor protections and deprioritize health and education spending. In their eyes, the business and political elites in his coalition, led by the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) have disregarded the   costs of impeachment for the poor, as they scrambled to leverage the Petrobras scandal and Brazil's sputtering economy for their own political gain. They worry about Temer's suspension of a government program to combat illiteracy, and his plans to reportedly expand the use of private prisons his allies in the   “bullet caucus,” a bloc of   lawmakers in Brazil's congress, hope to see expanded access to firearms nationwide. On August 28, the Sunday before Rousseff's impeachment, Rocinha was the site of “Funk Without Fear,” a politically themed party featuring funk carioca, a popular genre of irreverent electronic dance music. The neighborhood of some 100, 000 saw its fortunes rise under Rousseff and the PT's 13 years in power, with more of its residents able to attend university, open small businesses, and even purchase satellite TV dishes. Hence it was a logical site for what was, effectively, a wake for the party's political legacy. “For all the problems with the PT,” said the    event planner Michelle Lacerda, “it consistently gave us a lifeline here. ” The newly installed Temer promises to enact economic reforms that will improve the livelihoods of working Brazilians. “I just don't believe he'll govern in the full public interest, because his mandate doesn't come from the people,” Lacerda said. She pointed out that one of Temer's reforms, so far, has been to give federal judges a 41 percent raise. The main objective of “Funk Without Fear,” according to its organizers, was to protest the government of Temer (himself accused in   testimony of requesting bribes. He has been banned from running for public office for eight years for violating campaign finance laws). Why funk? Fillipe Dos Anjos, secretary of the Federation of Favela Associations of Rio, an advocacy group for favela residents across the city, explained that the genre “is uniquely Rio and it came out of Rio's favelas, which stand to lose dramatically with this impeachment. ” Dos Anjos, a    former navy member who lives in the favela of Santo Amaro and studies history at the State University of Rio, hoped the event would show that favelas are determined to be heard at a time when an icon of the Brazilian left is on life support. “Rio funk is about showing that creativity and solidarity are what make favelas great —  things that money alone can't buy,” he said. Funk, then, offered an appropriate, rambunctious soundtrack for the end of Rousseff. What lay ahead with Temer was uncertain.    While plans for Sunday's event began auspiciously, things soon took an ominous turn. By midday, a    sound system had been set up inside the   futsal, or miniature soccer court, at one entrance to Rocinha. “The intention is: Fill up the futsal court and have people dancing in the street,” MC Galo, a funk artist from the community, said. Organizers and local police commanders had sparred earlier in the week over the right to host the event, which organizers called a peaceful assembly, permitted under Rio state law. But the police said it required more paperwork, despite giving their verbal authorization. Festival organizers decided to speak directly with police on Sunday to see what size performance might be possible, but on site, “an officer told organizers if we turned on that sound system inside the futsal court, Rio's elite military police squad would invade the event, attack the band, and throw pepper spray on the crowd,” Galo said. Eventually, organizers were allowed to blast music from a speaker placed in the street running adjacent to the futsal court. Soon, residents streamed toward the sound as the emcees launched into their set: an anthem to favelas, a song decrying the daily violence of the war on drugs, and another repudiating police suppression of funk parties. The crowd of over 200 danced to classic '90s hits like “The Gorilla Dance,” belted the hymn of a Rio soccer team popular among the working class, and chanted “Out With Temer!” After issuing an appeal for an end to violence in favelas, one emcee led a simple    chant of “I want to live!” Thirty meters away, over a dozen police stood watch over the event. Three carried rifles. The Rio police declined   to answer questions about the police's attempted prohibition of the event. In an email, a police spokeswoman wrote that the solicitation for the event “did not follow some demands from a 2015 city decree about requirements for events in favelas. ” To Guilherme Pimentel, a lawyer who volunteers with a group providing legal support to funk artists, the attempt was typical behavior for Rio's PMDB state government, which “sends in the police as a reaction to issues that should have other solutions,” thus in his view “criminalizing poverty. ” Pimentel said “arbitrary prohibitions of freedom of expression” are a relic of Brazil's authoritarian past —  a past he fears may prove resurgent under Temer. Yet, it was the PT that caved on its promises to rein in the police and offer a vision for public security more respectful of human rights. In 2008, the party worked with the PMDB to institute the police pacification program, which sought to use   strategies to improve relations between the police and poor communities. But the program faltered due to budgetary cuts, leadership lapses, and the resistance of powerful,    local lawmakers. In an infamous case in 2013, officers in Rocinha tortured and killed Lacerda's uncle, a bricklayer. The PT, favela residents soon realized, would not be the party to finally change a police force long symbolic of the state's past as a military dictatorship.    Backsliding on police reform was just one element of the PT's conservative shift. Over the years, it pushed its agenda through Brazil's fractious congress by relying on its alliance with the PMDB, gradually pulling away from its leftist base. It yielded to increasingly powerful   pressure in Brazil, which also led Rousseff to back a   austerity regime after her 2014 reelection, further alienating the party's base and leading to the country's current political turmoil. As Sunday's funk event rolled into its fourth hour, MC Leonardo, who was born in Rocinha, drew rapt attention with a song written a few years after the launch of the favela pacification program, when it began to draw criticism for abuses. The DJ paused so Leonardo could cry out, a cappella. “People are planting seeds of ill, wanting to harvest something good,” he said. “It's all wrong. ” 	A bartender's camera captures the seedy street life of retro NY."

Gabonese opposition leader Jean Ping said the deaths occurred after police forces attacked his party's headquarters Wednesday night in Liberville, the capital, where residents say the internet has been cut. Mes pensées vont vers les anonymes qui ont été capturés, blessés ou tués durant les récents évènements. Dieu vous protège et bénisse #gabon, “My thoughts go out to the anonymous who were captured, injured, or killed during the recent events. God protect you and bless you,” Ping tweeted Thursday. Pacome Moubelet Boubeya, the country's interior minister, said at least 1, 000 people were arrested, the majority of them in Liberville.   Oye Zue, the police chief, told Agence   six officers were killed in the   protests, though he declined to give a total number of fatalities. The protests in Liberville first erupted Wednesday following the announcement Bongo won   by a narrow margin of 5, 594 votes —  a process Ping's supporters are calling rigged. Thousands of people took to the streets and the National Assembly building was set on fire. Photos and videos from the protests posted on Twitter show people shouting and chanting, injured protesters being carried away on stretchers by paramedics, and security forces dispersing the crowds using tear gas. Protests continued Thursday in Liberville, where witnesses have reported gunshots, blasts, and looting. Bongo addressed the violence a series of tweets Thursday, in which he reaffirmed his respect for the electoral process and acknowledged the deaths of those killed. Je veux exprimer ma grande tristesse devant le décès de certains de nos concitoyens #DirectABO, “I want to express my great sadness at the death of some of our citizens,” he tweeted.   Ping rejected the election results and echoed calls made by the USA, France, and the EU for the Gabonese government to release the election results by individual polling stations. “The citizens of Gabon peacefully and respectfully exercised their right to freely and fairly choose our country's next president,” Ping said in a statement Wednesday. “The current president, Ali Bongo, did not approve of their choice, so he substituted his will for theirs. ” Bongo was first elected president of Gabon in 2009, succeeding his father, Omar, who ruled the     African country for 42 years. The country faced similar violent protests following the 2009 election, in which two people were killed. 	A bartender's camera captures the seedy street life of retro NY."

There's been a 35 percent increase in the number of people using marijuana since 2002 —  from 6. 2 percent of people over the age of 12 that year to 8. 4 percent in 2014, according to a new analysis released Thursday by the CDC. And the number of people using marijuana daily or almost daily, though still a relatively small 2. 5 percent of the population, has nearly doubled. Two and a half million Americans aged 12 or older used marijuana for the first time in 2014, the most recent year the CDC studied. That's an average of 7, 000 new pot users every day —  1, 000 more than there were in 2002. Meanwhile, slightly fewer   to    are smoking weed: There's been a 10 percent decrease in   marijuana use among that group since 2002. This is despite the fact, the CDC notes, that teens are now less likely to perceive “great risk” from smoking marijuana. The biggest rise in marijuana use —  a 65 percent jump —  was seen among those older than 26. The findings suggest that as marijuana laws are relaxing, people perceive the drug to be less harmful. Since 2002, the number of people who think of the drug as very risky has declined, and now, just a quarter of Americans think so. People are also more likely now to believe there would be no penalty for being caught with marijuana, and they're less likely to fear they'd get jail time. Marijuana Use in Adults, As more people view marijuana as a relatively safe drug, they're more likely to try it. Since 2002, the CDC found, Americans have become more likely to buy weed and less likely to get it for free or share it. A Lancet Psychiatry study on adult marijuana use, also out this week, showed that Americans began to perceive less harm from marijuana use around 2007, at which point 12 states had legalized medical marijuana. That study also found no increase in “marijuana use disorders,” or feeling dependent on pot, despite a rise in use.   The CDC findings don't necessarily imply that legalization has no effect on teen pot use, since many states didn't legalize medical or recreational marijuana until 2014. Still, the fact that teens don't seem to be smoking weed in greater numbers —   even though the adults around them are —  is positive news for the   movement, since concerns over teen pot use is a common argument against relaxing pot laws. It's all further evidence that as states are treating marijuana like the new alcohol, everyday people are beginning to see it that way, too.

Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, Camden, New Jersey, has long had a reputation as one of the most dangerous cities in America. In 2012, the city made an unprecedented move by terminating its entire   police force in favor of hiring   workers supervised by the county. Officials at that time said that union contracts, in a city with a major lack of revenue, made it financially impossible to keep enough officers on the street. Two years after the overhaul, the department employed 411 officers with nearly the same budget. During a visit to the city last year, Obama praised the Camden County Police Department for it's drastic turnaround in its culture and its ability to build community relations. Obama called the department a “symbol of promise for the nation. ” Still, the city's   police force looks drastically different than the city that surrounds it: While 94 percent of the city's population is   white officers make up 68 percent of the Camden's officers.   police shootings in cities like Ferguson, Cleveland, and Falcon Heights, have highlighted communities around the nation that are fractured along racial lines, and have tense relationships with the police. Officer Cabria Davis, who was born and raised in Camden, has worked for the Camden County Police Department for two years. I spoke to Davis about her   assignment what it takes to build trust in a community processing police brutality as a black, female cop and why helping kids interact with police is good for everyone in the community. The interview that follows has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Adrienne Green: What inspired you to become a police officer? Cabria Davis: I was born and raised in the city of Camden, New Jersey. When I was 9 years old, my father was murdered. He was shot and died. I really didn't have a close relationship with him. When that happened, it changed something in me as a person because I felt like I was robbed of that relationship. I wanted to make a positive difference [in the community] because even though I couldn't help my father, maybe I could grow up and help somebody else. Green: What is the community in Camden, New Jersey, like? What are some of the problems you're looking out for? Davis: Right now, the environment, demographic makeup, businesses, and residences are constantly changing. The government is trying to improve the quality of life of Camden with new schools to give the younger generation better opportunities. Businesses are also trying to create something positive in the city, allow the residents to have jobs, and give them a more positive atmosphere. Of course, as the police, we are trying to build a level of trust with the citizens here because our particular style of policing is more  . We try to let them know that our presence is constant: We're trying to learn, understand them and what they require from us. At the end of the day, we work for them. Green: How do you establish that trust? Davis: We have   barbecues for the kids. Officers go to these barbecues and play games we also cook for the kids. The kids get a chance to see us as regular people, and we let them know that we're their friends. Then, of course, we have the community meetings where our   talks to community leaders about the issues that they are having. They also just implemented the school patrol, which is when the department assigns an officer to patrol the schools. I am assigned to the five schools in North Camden, and I patrol them between the hours of 8 a. m. and 4 p. m. I talk to the teachers, principals, and students. That helps us establish another level of trust and communication with them because if the schools have a concern —  be it with a student, a parent, or things like traffic —  they have us right there. I take 15 to 20 minutes each hour per school, and I'll just rotate. I try to do at least four to five patrols of each school per school day. One principal asked if I could patrol between the hours of 11 and 1 because that's his primary lunch period and there were a lot of   students. I try my best to accommodate the needs of each principal, teacher, or school. Green: What is an average day like as a patrol officer at five schools? Davis: Before I patrolled schools, I was assigned to the   team, which is proactive policing. We did walking patrols in order to adjust crime conditions, drugs, and assaults. The special assignment for patrolling the schools is a safety initiative that was started by our district lieutenant. The most important aspect is the children. If you build a relationship with them, they get used to seeing you, you become a constant and consistent factor in their life. Then they'll say, ”Oh, this officer is friendly. This officer comes to see me at school every day.” It may help to combat [negative feelings] if they had a friend or family member that had a negative experience with the police —  because that colors their judgment as children because they learn based on what they see, and they absorb all of that. I've had children ask me, “Do you lock up kids? My uncle was locked up,” and it makes them sad because they don't understand. But then, if they see you and you say hi to them, you tell them your name, shake their hand, give them stickers —  it creates that trust with them. I've had instances where a parent will tell a child not to speak to me because I'm a police officer. That's not a good thing because as police officers, if your child is lost or in danger or something has happened, they should want to come to us. If you're telling them, as their parent, not to come to us, that is something that we have to fix. Maybe that parent had a negative relationship with the police, so now they're passing that on to their child and their child has to grow up with that mentality. Davis: If I was conducting my proactive patrols on the street level and I observed a fight, as an officer I would have to intervene so that no one gets hurt. But in the schools, it's not so much my job to enforce if I see two students fighting. I'm just there as a supplement to the principal or to the teacher, I'm not going to physically intervene because that is overstepping a boundary. At the end of the day, that principal, teacher, or parent is responsible for that student. They don't want to feel like police is singling out their children. Green: You've worked for the Camden County Police Department for two years. Have you seen the   trust that you're trying to build improve? Davis: It ebbs and flows. There are periods where it is very positive. Citizens get used to seeing us on the street, and they appreciate the increased police presence. They appreciate us walking our beats, patrolling the stores, playing basketball with the kids, and getting to know the people in the community. Then, with everything that's going on in the media, it changes the dynamic of that relationship. There are questions like, “Okay, I've known this officer for X amount of months, but here is this [instance of police violence] in the media. ” Now it's gotten to the point where we approach people, and they are like, ”What you want? I didn't do anything wrong. ” We're just trying to continue to build that level of trust, because we know what the media shows and we're just trying to show people that not every situation is that way. There are negative and positive engagements, just like with every other aspect of working or personal relationships. We had that level of trust, and now we have to work to rebuild it. Green: It appears that 94 percent of Camden's residents are   but 68 percent of the police force is made up of white officers. Amid the tense relationships between police and communities of color, has your ability to build trust been hampered? Davis: Even though Camden is predominately   and our police force is 68 percent Caucasian —  I don't think race affects how we police. Of course, the [minority] citizens feel like those [white] officers don't understand their personal views about the city, and they would be more comfortable speaking to someone like me. Residents may have these negative viewpoints, but once they talk to an officer they realize, ”Oh, just because he is not from my city, just because he does not look like me, doesn't mean that he doesn't care.” It doesn't matter if it's an African American officer or a Caucasian officer most of the time what people see is our uniform, so we have to learn how to get past that. Yes, I wear this uniform. Yes, I wear this badge however, behind all of this I am still somebody's daughter, somebody's spouse. I'm still a human. I still have feelings. It doesn't matter what a person's race is. My job as an officer is to be here for you. Green: I understand that you are a black, female police officer. How do you balance those personal and professional identities? Davis: It's a    basis. I had an incident where one of my fellow officers, who is Caucasian, had a negative engagement, and a gentleman that he spoke to felt uncomfortable. The civilian felt like he was being harassed because of the color of his skin. I said, ”Listen sir, [the other officer's] engagement with you has nothing to do with [his] race. I could just as easily have engaged you if I've never seen you before, but you would take a different attitude toward [the other officer] because of his race. ” Our job is to know who is in our community. That's what we do. I understand because I'm from this city, and that helps. Some people are more comfortable speaking to me because they're like, ”You understand because you're black or you're a woman.” I get that. That trust in me [as a black woman] helps to build trust between not only me and that person, but also that person and other officers whether they're Caucasian, Hispanic, or Asian. If I can act as a positive tether between those two people, then at the end of the day, that's what counts. Green: When you look at policing in communities nationwide, do you still feel that race should be as irrelevant as you see it being in Camden? Davis: It depends on the community, because different communities have their own way of policing. It doesn't necessarily mean it's racially based or racially motivated. People view the world through their own feelings, thoughts, and actions. It might not necessarily be what the case is, but you can only base your viewpoints on what you've experienced. The engagement of an encounter might not be   but because of your personal experience, that's how you view it and that's not always the case. Green: Do the parts of your identity —  as a black woman and as a trained police officer —  weigh differently into your interpretation of these types of events? Davis: As an officer, you don't know what another officer sees or feels at a particular moment, so we have no right to judge that person. But at the end of the day, if all of a person's engagements with police have been negative, naturally they're going to be a little afraid to interact with the police because they don't know what's going to happen. I can't verbalize my opinion because, at the end of the day, as an officer, I have to be completely unbiased. As a human, my first reaction was to get angry and upset about certain things. But being an officer forces you to take a step back and look at everything from all sides. For example, in a domestic dispute, if you have two people fighting and two different sides of the argument, you have to listen to all sides and then use objectivity to determine how you handle the situation. You can't allow your personal bias or personal experience color your judgment as an officer, because then you're not effective. If you go over there and the first thing you want to do is lock somebody up, you're not helping him or her. You're just creating a bigger issue. Green: What's the most rewarding and the most challenging part of your job? Davis: The most rewarding, of course, is the kids. If you're having a bad day as an officer, you just left a domestic dispute, and then a kid hugs you or draws you a picture or makes a little snowflake, it makes you feel good. I keep them in my bag. I had a little girl give me a book. She'll always see me and ask, “Do you still have the book I gave you?” I keep it in my bag so she knows how much I treasure that book. It doesn't matter if it was a $2 book. It's just the fact that she felt comfortable enough with me to want to do this positive thing for me. You're trying to give this child, who has to grow up and become their own person, positive energy. You have the power as an authority figure to, in a way, change their life. I had another situation where an older man, who was involved in drugs, almost died. I was able to get help to him, and he told me a few months later that he actually remembered me. He said, “I'm in school now. I don't use drugs anymore. I go to church and I work out. ” Whenever he sees me, he always wants to shake my hand because he feels like I saved him. To have that positive impact on somebody's life makes this career rewarding, but then of course, you have the situations where you have to lock up a parent and their children are there, and it breaks your heart. It's like, ”I don't want to see this kid cry. I don't want to hurt this kid, but I have to get this negative person away from them.” It hurts you because just like I don't want to be a bad person. I don't want to be seen as a bad person to this kid, but I have to do what I have to do to protect them. As a human, that type of stuff affects you on an emotional level because you see the type of emotional damage that humans do to other humans in fits of anger. It bothers me because I have to be objective, but at the same time, once I take that uniform off, I'm still a human underneath there. You still have to think about your whole day. You have to learn how to compartmentalize in a way so that it doesn't have a negative effect on your personality. If you're angry because someone hurt someone else, and you bring that home, you can create problems in your family life. At the same time, you can use that positive relationship that you have at home and bring that back to work and give a piece of that positive relationship to change someone's day for the better. Green: Has your job has influenced your identity? Davis: I've learned to use what I've learned through work —  ethical trainings and how to   conflict —  in my personal life. Before I became an officer, I was a very emotional person. The job has shown me to look at every situation from a different person's aspect, not just your own aspect. It forces you to take a step back and say, ”Okay, I'm not always right, so let me just take a step back and think about this other person's feelings. ” This interview is a part of an ongoing project on work and identity in America. You may find other pieces here, including interviews with an optometrist, a coal miner, and an engineer. 	A bartender's camera captures the seedy street life of retro NY."

Please follow the steps below, NEWS BRIEF John Hinckley was a mentally disturbed 25 year old in 1981 when he tried to assassinate President Reagan. A jury found Hinckley not guilty by reason of insanity, and ever since then he has lived in treatment at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D. C. But on September 10, he will take up new residence as a free man in Virginia in line with a judge's order last month. Hinckley's   lawyer, Barry Levine, announced the date Thursday, saying, “I think he will be a citizen about whom we can all be proud. ” Hinckley will move in with his mother, who has a home in Williamsburg. More than 30 years ago, Hinckley obsessed over Jodi Foster and her role in the 1976 film Taxi Driver, a story of a cab driver played by Robert De Niro who stalks a woman (played by Foster) and hopes to win her affection by killing a presidential candidate. Hinckley suffered from major depression and a psychotic disorder at the time, and he sought to emulate the movie's plot in real life. He stalked Foster at Yale University, where she was a student, and later followed President Jimmy Carter. When Reagan won the presidential election in 1980, Hinckley focused his obsession on him. On March 30, 1981, Hinckley shot Reagan in the chest and also wounded three others, including press secretary James Brady. Reagan eventually recovered. Here's a photo of the moment just after the shooting:   Reagan assassin John Hinckley Jr. adjusts to life in Virginia https:  .  via @CBS6 pic. twitter.  Hinckley has spent 34 years as a patient at St. Elizabeths Hospital. In the past decade, he has been given more freedom, traveling alone to visit his mother's home in Williamsburg. In that time, he's made more than 80 unsupervised trips out of the hospital, according to a court order released in July. In that order, U. S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman wrote that Hinckley, now 61, no longer poses a danger to himself or others, and for almost 30 years has shown “no signs of psychotic symptoms, delusional thinking, or any violent tendencies. ” The U. S. Secret Service has closely monitored Hinckley on many of his trips outside the hospital, usually while Hinckley makes visits to   Petsmart, or Subway, like in this photo taken last month when Hinckley stopped for a sandwich. Tastes like  …     freedom! A   paunchy John Hinckley enjoys a Subway sandwich after  …     https:  .  pic. twitter.  After the jury found Hinckley not guilty by reason of insanity, many U. S. states rewrote their laws to make it harder for the accused to prove they are insane. Hinckley's case also changed   laws. Brady, the press secretary injured in the shooting, spent much of his life fighting for stricter background checks for gun sales. He died in 2014, and police ruled his death a homicide. Reagan ultimately forgave Hinckley. But when his release was announced in July, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute said, “Contrary to the judge's decision, we believe John Hinckley is still a threat to others, and we strongly oppose his release. ” Hinckley's lawyer, Levine, has said Hinckley's actions all those years ago do not reflect the motives of an inherently evil man. Instead, he said, they're the result of a mental illness. “He is profoundly sorry,” Levine told The Washington Post in July, “and he wishes he could take back that day, but he can't. ” 	A bartender's camera captures the seedy street life of retro NY."
58427,80108,"Trump's Media Saturation, Quantified",Atlantic,Adrienne LaFrance,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, Trump is everywhere. It sometimes seems, and has seemed this way for several months, that the Republican nominee is all anyone can talk about. Whether this is because the media is doing its duty or because news organizations are capitalizing on Trump's bombast for ratings and traffic is a matter of debate. But one thing is clear: Trump is getting outsized attention compared with his opponents. The Atlantic's daily media tracker, which tallies television mentions of the candidates, shows Trump dominating. As of March, journalism's obsession with Trump had totaled the equivalent of about $2 billion in free media, according to an analysis by mediaQuant, a company that uses advertising rates to assign a dollar amount to the amount of media coverage a candidate gets. Clinton had garnered about $746 million in free media at the time, The NY Times reported, while Bernie Sanders free media totaled about $321 million. (“Free media” doesn't necessarily help a candidate, though. Though Trump seems to embrace the “no publicity is bad publicity” mantra, his favorability ratings among voters are miserable.) In the course of reporting another story, I've come across another staggering way to quantify and compare coverage of the candidates. Drawing from more than 50 newspapers in Nexis's archives, I've been pulling all the coverage related to Trump, Clinton, and Sanders over a   period from July 2015 to August 2016. (I also pulled 13 months of coverage from Bill Clinton's run for president in 1991 and 1992.) What I found is one of the clearest illustrations of how the pace of journalism has changed in the past 25 years: Even as newsrooms are smaller than ever, they're producing far more journalism —  at least in the realm of presidential campaign coverage. And that's largely because of how technology has upended the journalism industry as it once operated. In the mobile internet age, the appetite for      news is insatiable. Between 1994 and 2014, the industry cut over 20, 000 jobs, representing a 39 percent decline, according to a Pew report earlier this year. And yet, among the newspapers I looked at, there were more than double the amount of articles written about Clinton over a   period in 2015 and 2016 than there were written about her husband over the same time period when he ran for president in 1992.  (The coverage from this year includes   stories produced by newspapers, whereas the coverage from 1992 only comes from print stories.) The 2016 Candidates Who Are Making Headlines, Before we go any further, there are plenty of caveats to assessing coverage this way. For one, just looking at quantity tells us nothing about quality so there's really no fair way to discern from numbers alone whether this trend is a good thing, journalistically. (Many journalists lament the pace of the news today, and understandably so, but as a news consumer I would never want to return to an era where you had to wait for the nightly news or the morning paper to find out what had happened in the past several hours.) Besides that, there are other factors —  like coverage of the Benghazi hearings last October —  that help explain why so much more was written about Hillary than Bill. There's also the simple matter of space: On the internet, where writers aren't restricted by inches, there's more room to expand with   articles, and incremental updates. And, finally, there's certainly some overlap among the articles I pulled —  even though Nexis does some automatic correcting for duplicates —  because many articles are about more than one candidate. All we know, from this   is that reporters from the same set of newspapers —  or, their consolidated successors, as is the case among some metro dailies —  published 7, 945 articles about Bill Clinton during his 1992 run 18, 640 articles about Clinton over a   period in 2015 and 2016 7, 841 articles about Bernie Sanders over that same period and a whopping 29, 019 stories about Trump. In the coming weeks, I'll have deeper analysis about what that coverage actually reveals. 	A bartender's camera captures the seedy street life of retro NY."

Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, “We almost beat one guy to death to make him kiss the flag,” a patriot in Litchfield, Illinois, told a Chicago reporter in 1940. When that vigilante beat a dissenter in the street —  and when hundreds like him brutalized, terrorized, and even mutilated Jehovah's Witnesses around the country  —  they were acting, they believed, with the imprimatur of the law, the Constitution, and the Supreme Court, which had ruled that the Witnesses' religious objection to reciting the Pledge of Allegiance was invalid. God vs. the Federal Election Commission, The Court and the nation learned a lesson from that episode. Lessons in tolerance, however, must be learned anew generation by generation. Not long ago, the public worked itself into an uproar when Olympic gymnast Gabby Douglas, respectfully standing for the anthem in Rio, simply did not place her hands the way some people thought she should. But that was mere prologue to the outcry over San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who refused even to stand for the anthem before a game at Levi's Stadium, and who, unlike Douglas, did so in protest. “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” he said afterwards, citing recent incidents including   protests and police shootings of   civilians.  The patriotic denunciations of Kaepernick are available on virtually any website and inescapable on any   station. He has been vilified (and supported) by fellow athletes and by groups of veterans. The San Francisco police union weighed in. No matter what their position, people all over the nation seem deeply anxious about whether this one highly paid athlete will behave in the manner expected of him. And many will be watching Thursday night at the   game to see whether he has learned his lesson. Flags and anthems and patriotic display can inspire love and heroism but they can also bring out the worst in people. Add war, social unease, sports, and race and the fists are likely to fly. This was the context of one of the Court's most humiliating mistakes —  one that led directly to violence in the streets, required the Court to eat its own words, and may teach us a lesson in tolerance today. Let's be clear what is at stake. Kaepernick has not expressed allegiance to or support for the nation's enemies. He has not made any criticism or attack on America's military. He has not refused to do his job as quarterback. He has not asked anyone to take down a flag, or sought to veto the playing of “The   Banner. ” He has not asserted a right to discriminate against anyone who does want to stand and salute during the National Anthem. Kaepernick has simply indicated that, for reasons he is willing to explain, he himself will not pay personal homage to our nation's symbol. Others may think he shouldn't feel that way, but he does, and he will not pretend to feel what he does not. That issue —  the compelled assertion of personal allegiance, a requirement by the state that individuals express feelings they did not hold —  brought the flag before the Court in 1940, and, after the decision, led directly to blood in the streets of American towns like Litchfield. Minersville School District v. Gobitis arose in 1935, when two Jehovah's Witnesses, Billy and Lillian Gobitas, refused to engage in a required flag salute and pledge of allegiance at their Pennsylvania elementary school. For Witnesses, pledging allegiance to any human symbol is a violation of the Second Commandment: “You must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that is in the heavens above or on the earth below or in the waters under the earth.  You must not bow down to them nor be enticed to serve them   …     ” The local school board expelled them local people boycotted the family store. Lower federal courts supported their right to refuse the pledge. The case, however, reached the Supreme Court in 1940, as German armies were grinding toward Paris. The justices rejected the children's   claim to an exemption from the   requirement. (Poignantly enough, the Court could not even be bothered to spell the children's last name correctly.)  In the majority opinion, Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote that “We are dealing with an interest inferior to none in the hierarchy of legal values. National unity is the basis of national security. ” The legislature must have the freedom to promote that unity by requiring children to pledge allegiance, he wrote, and religious objections were no defense. As outlined in Shawn Francis Peters's Judging Jehovah's Witnesses: Religious Persecution and the Dawn of the Rights Revolution, the court's decision set off a wave of mob violence and persecution. (The quote from the Litchefield vigilante comes from the book.) Witness meeting houses were looted and burned. Citizens held public bonfires of Witness literature. Witnesses, tied together with ropes, were   out of towns in many states. Witnesses publicly soiled themselves after being   castor oil. A Nebraska mob castrated a Witness. Law enforcement did little. “They're traitors —  the Supreme Court says so,” one Texas sheriff told a northern journalist. By 1943, the court itself repented. The public outcry, the addition of a new justice, and three switched votes produced a new rule. Whatever “free exercise” of religion required, the new majority decided, the salute requirement violated the First Amendment's twin guarantee, free speech. In a famous passage, Justice Robert Jackson wrote that “If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein. ” Stripped of its color of law, persecution of the Witnesses slowly subsided. And the Court cleansed its escutcheon of a deep blot. Critics will be quick to point out that the court's misadventure is not directly on point in the Kaepernick. No one is forcing anyone to stand or exacting any legal punishment for those who do not. And Kaepernick, having made a political gesture, should expect criticism as well as discussion of his criticisms of American society. Nonetheless, the debate needs careful watching, remembering the context of Gobitis. That case arose as the world slid into war. The collapse of France, which happened while the opinion was being written, offered a terrifying spectacle —  the strongest military power in Europe undone in large part by its own internal disunity. Americans were worried about “fifth columnists” at home, and they mistook the Witnesses (persecuted in Axis and Allied countries alike) for Nazi sympathizers. The current controversy has already produced a public jersey burning. It would be too easy for the dispute to swell into boycotts and blacklists. How much of the national truculence about this minor football dispute arises from one stark fact —  that the current state of “authorized military force,” begun in the wake of September 11, is now by far the longest “war” the USA has fought —  nearly twice the length of the Revolution, nearly five times the length of World War II? For a decade and a half Americans have hated and feared an unseen, and indeed largely unnamed, enemy, one that has drawn blood inside the nation's borders and killed its young soldiers abroad. The country is nervous, and has reason to be. Stir into the brew another simmering American toxin. Since slavery times, dissent by black Americans has alarmed the white majority. Southern society kept a wary eye on black preachers —  a vigilance that found an echo in 2008, when many whites suspected that candidate Obama was tainted by exposure to a black minister named Jeremiah Wright. Wright's critical rhetoric, however, had deep roots, going back at least as far as Frederick Douglass, who in 1852 addressed a largely white Fourth of July celebration by saying, “The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me. The sunlight that brought light and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me. This Fourth July is yours, not mine. ” Dissent by athletes in particular has often brought sharp rebuke American society has come to repent the punishments visited on Muhammad Ali for his draft refusal and on Tommie Smith and John Carlos for their public protest at the 1968 Olympics. But the urge to punish new dissenters is persistent it can link powerfully with hatred of foreigners. In an echo of the Gobitis era, one presidential candidate has proposed that this hatred take the form of law, whether of religious bans, “deportation forces,” or required indoctrination. Blood has already been shed at his rallies without a change in rhetoric, there will be more. The debate over Kaepernick's seated posture will be a welcome one if it begins with the recognition that symbolic issues are complex, that the conscience is a personal matter, and a society should be wary lest fear, xenophobia, religious intolerance, and racial animosity don patriot's garb. In a free country, no one has to kiss the flag. 	A bartender's camera captures the seedy street life of retro NY."
58429,80110,Why Georgetown's Offer Falls Short,Atlantic,Adrienne Green,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, In 1838, the priests at the helm of Georgetown University sold 272 slaves who worked on Jesuit plantations in southern Maryland, the proceeds of which were used to pay off the university's debts. Now, nearly two centuries after they made that profit, university officials are trying to make amends to the families of those slaves. The university announced Thursday that in an effort to “respond to its historical ties to the institution of slavery,” the descendants of those 272 slaves will receive admission to the university in the same way it treats other legacy applicants whose parents or siblings are alumni. According to The NY Times, the policy will apply to descendants of all the slaves whose labor benefited Georgetown, not just those sold in 1838. The university did not respond immediately to a request for clarification. “The most appropriate ways for us to redress the participation of our predecessors in the institution of slavery is to address the manifestations of the legacy of slavery in our time,” said Georgetown President John J. DeGioia, who will offer a formal apology detail the university's plan at a press conference Thursday afternoon. How to Acknowledge a Shameful Past, While this treatment of student descendants of slaves in admissions is unprecedented, the announcement follows similar news from elite universities like Brown and Harvard, which have also made efforts to publicly reckon with the racism that is cemented in their pasts. From removing a slaveholder's mural from a dining hall to nixing the title of “housemaster,” each public atonement reveals the magnitude to which racism has always been entangled in America's most sacred institutions —  oftentimes, and in this case, as an explicit source of profit. Last September —  amid a series of protests on college campuses nationwide about racism and lack of inclusion —  DeGioia convened a group at Georgetown composed of faculty, students, and alumni, including some of the descendants of those slaves, to make recommendations on how to acknowledge the slavery connection. Some of their recommendations included: renaming two halls, a formal apology, creating an institute to study slavery, and developing a public memorial to the enslaved. Their recommendations, however, didn't extend beyond the adjusted admissions policy they didn't recommend that those accepted be compensated financially through scholarships. The original sale of the 272 slaves was an example of the institution and America's storied history with racism. But it was also a financial transaction whose benefactor was clear. Addressing the current manifestations of Georgetown's participation in slavery through an admissions policy begets their acknowledgment of their social failure. But Georgetown's cost of attendance totals nearly $70, 000 —  how will it ensure that these students can actually take advantage of the new offer?  Minority families already possess less wealth overall than white families, and minorities and poor students already shoulder the most student debt. There is no real reconciliation in lumping black families into the same broad policy as families that have been sending their kids to Georgetown for generations regardless. It is still unclear what kind of programs and funding will be set aside for these students once admitted. The policy will undoubtedly help some students gain access to an elite education. But in failing to ensure that the accepted students actually thrive once they get there, it serves as another example of universities falling short of their commitment to educate students of all backgrounds.

58430,80111,What Was So Shocking About Trump's Immigration Speech?,Atlantic,David Frum,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, “Anyone who has entered the USA illegally is subject to deportation —  that is what it means to have laws and to have a country. ” That line from Trump's immigration speech in Phoenix was tweeted out, highlighted in yellow marker, by Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for Clinton, with the shocked header: “Explicit line on deportation from Trump's speech. ” If nothing else, Trump's speech succeeded in forcing into full public view the underlying attitudes that have shaped not only the Clinton campaign's immigration policy but the media coverage of the whole issue. In her speech in Reno, Nevada, Clinton quoted a saying: “Tell me with whom you walk, and I will tell you who you are. ” A professional politician, of all people, should appreciate the untruth of those words: It's almost a job qualification to “walk with” people with whom you disagree in important ways. (I'm looking right now at a photo of President Clinton walking with Yasser Arafat, for example.) But the words could accurately be updated : “Tell me what shocks you, and I'll tell you who you are. ” So let's review the Trump speech and pull out the lines that are supposed to be so shocking —  and wonder together how immigration became the topic area where it is most offensive to tell manifest truths. “Not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. ” Whether we are measuring by economic success, criminal offenses, national security threats, or contributions to the arts and sciences —  not all immigrants are equal. Not all immigration sources are equal either.   percent of immigrants from India arrive with a college degree or higher, as compared to only 13 percent of immigrants from Latin America. These effects persist over two and three generations. Refugees from the communist crackdown in Hungary in 1956 have flourished in America. More than a quarter century after they began to arrive in America, Somali refugees have not.   Japanese immigrants committed crimes at rates much lower than that of other Americans Mexican immigrants have historically offended at elevated rates. Why is any of this surprising? Nobody who valued the protections of a welfare state would voluntarily migrate from France to the USA —  but a person with a   idea very well might. The opposite would be true from a country like Brazil. “Most illegal immigrants are   workers with less education who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they will ever pay in. ”   workers in the USA receive much more in benefits and transfers than they pay in taxes, especially if they live past age 65.   people will pay much more than they receive. That's how the system is designed in every advanced society. What it means, however, is that loose talk about needing immigrants to solve the problems of, for example, Medicare is like the old joke about losing money on every sale but trying to make it up on volume. Many of these redistributive programs are available to illegal immigrants too, especially the programs financed by state taxes. Illegal immigrants send their children to public schools. They use public clinics, roads, and prisons. They are eligible for   tax credits —  and often receive the Earned Income Tax Credit. These are all exhaustively documented facts. Plans to put millions of illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship —  and thus Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Section 8 housing, and so on —  will cost billions more. Those costs don't go away because proponents think it is somehow bad form to mention them. “The central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants —  or however many there may be. That has never been the central issue. It will never be the central issue. ” Here are some issues not discussed in Clinton's immigration plan: How many immigrants should the USA take? Who should they be? What should be expected of them? How do we know whether U. S. immigration policy is succeeding or failing? Literally every point in her most public statement of her immigration views deals with the interests of immigrants themselves, and especially of illegal immigrants. Nobody would do banking policy that way, or any other area of public concern. But to test immigration policy against the interests first and foremost of Americans themselves? Well again: Tell me what you find shocking, and I'll tell you who you are. 	A bartender's camera captures the seedy street life of retro NY."
58431,80112,Which Republicans Oppose Trump? A Cheat Sheet,Atlantic,David A. Graham,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, Clinton leads Trump among several key demographic groups, but she has also locked up a surprisingly large portion of one small but notable niche: neoconservatives. In an interview with Der Spiegel published on Friday, Paul Wolfowitz, who served as deputy secretary of defense during George W. Bush's presidency, said he would likely vote for Clinton —  though he noted he had “big reservations” about her. Wolfowitz said he agreed with those who deemed the Republican nominee a security threat. “The only way you can be comfortable about Trump's foreign policy, is to think he doesn't really mean anything he says,” he said. “Our security depends on having good relationships with our allies. Trump mainly shows contempt for them. And he seems to be unconcerned about the Russian aggression in Ukraine. By doing this he tells them that they can go ahead and do what they are doing. That is dangerous. ” Wolfowitz is only the latest in his cohort to throw his support behind Clinton, or at the very least to declare public opposition to Trump. Neoconservative intellectuals and pundits like Bill Kristol, Max Boot, and Robert Kagan have also been particularly harsh in criticizing Trump. Richard Armitage, who is less associated with the group but served under Bush, has also announced he'll support Clinton. Meanwhile, former StateSecretary Condoleezza Rice and President Bush himself have remained pointedly silent, declining to back the Republican nominee. There are a few notable exceptions, and they are perhaps the two   neoconservatives: former Vice President Dick Cheney, and former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Those two men were both in Republican politics before the rise of the neocons, and found that their belligerent style was well tailored to an alliance. They are also, as Jonathan Chait notes, among the Gentile members of a movement that originated with Jewish intellectuals. There are some straightforward reasons for the alliance with Clinton. Though they may disagree with her on many issues, particularly domestically, the neocons are focused more than anything on foreign policy. In that realm, Clinton represents a fairly standard, mainstream position, and in fact she has shown herself to be somewhat more hawkish than many Democrats, backing both the war in Iraq and intervention in Libya. Trump, on the other hand, has toppled pillar after pillar of policy orthodoxy, from his praise for Vladimir Putin to his dismissal of longstanding alliances. But the wave of neocon love also makes many of Clinton's Democratic supporters uncomfortable. As the chaotic and failed attempts to stop Trump over the last year have shown, there's no obviously right choice for how conservatives should respond. But which choice are people making? Here's a list of some major figures and where they stand on Trump —  right now. We'll keep it updated as other important people take stances, or as these ones change their views about Trump. George W. Bush: ABSTAINThe former president “does not plan to participate in or comment on the presidential campaign,” an aide told the Texas Tribune. (May 4, 2016) George H. W. Bush: ABSTAIN“At age 91, President Bush is retired from politics. He came out of retirement to do a few things for Jeb, but those were the exceptions that proved the rule,” an aide told the Texas Tribune. (May 4, 2016) Barbara Bush: NAYUnlike her husband and elder son, the former first lady has publicly disavowed Trump. “I mean, unbelievable. I don't know how women can vote for someone who said what he said about Megyn Kelly, it's terrible,” she told CBS in February. “And we knew what he meant too. ” (February 4, 2016) Mitt Romney: NAYThe party's 2012 nominee, one of Trump's staunchest critics during the primary, told The Wall Street Journal, “I wanted my grandkids to see that I simply couldn't ignore what Mr. Trump was saying and doing, which revealed a character and temperament unfit for the leader of the free world. ” Romney continued: “I know that some people are offended that someone who lost and is the former nominee continues to speak, but that's how I can sleep at night. ” (May 27, 2016) Romney previously told The Washington Post he would skip the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, and said at a D. C. dinner that he won't be supporting Trump. (May 5, 2016) Bob Dole: YEA (formerly UNDECIDED) The former Senate majority leader and 1996 Republicans presidential nominee endorsed Trump on May 6. He will also be the only living Republicans nominee to attend the RNC. (May 6, 2016.) Dole previously would not commit to voting for Trump but said in January that Trump would be preferable to Cruz. (May 5, 2016) John Boehner: YEAThe former speaker, who says he and Trump are “texting buddies,” told an audience at Stanford University that he'd back Trump in the general election. (April 28, 2016) Trent Lott: YEAThe former Senate majority leader told The   that he will back Trump, despite some reservations. (May 4, 2016) Tom DeLay: UNDECIDEDAsked by reporter Jon Ward whether Clinton or Trump was worse, the former House majority leader responded, “I can't answer that right now. ” (June 21, 2016) DeLay hadn't spoken out since Trump's ascension, but was highly critical of him during the primary: “We have got to stop Trump. Whatever it takes without cheating or violating the rules of the Republican primaries,” he told Newsmax. Dick Cheney: YEAThe former vice president blasted Trump during the primary over his stance on   and said he “sounds like a liberal Democrat,” but he now says he will back the nominee. (May 6, 2016) Newt Gingrich: YEAThe former speaker of the House did not formally endorse Trump during the primary, but he has repeatedly praised the mogul and his vision, and is said to be a contender for a position in a Trump administration. Jeb Bush: NAYThe former Florida governor and presidential candidate came to detest Trump during the campaign. In April, he said he would not attend the Republican National Convention. He now says he will not vote for either Trump or Clinton. (May 6, 2016) Reince Priebus: YEAAs chair of the Republican National Committee, Priebus doesn't really have a choice, though that doesn't mean he won't pour Baileys in his cereal over it. (May 4, 2016) . @realDonaldTrump will be presumptive @Republicans nominee, we all need to unite and focus on defeating @HillaryClinton #NeverClinton, Priebus said on May 6 that Trump needs to change his tone. Rick Perry: YEAThe former Texas governor and presidential candidate —  who was one of the first to blast Trump —  told CNN that he backs Trump. (  ) Mike Huckabee: YEAThe former Arkansas governor, who ran for president this year, says Republicans should get in line.  “When we nominated people over the past several election cycles, some of us had heartburn, but we stepped up and supported the nominee,” he said. “You're either on the team, or you're not on the team. ” (May 5, 2016) Bobby Jindal: YEAThe former Louisiana governor, who during his own presidential campaign called Trump a “narcissist” and an “egomaniacal madman,” wrote in a Wall Street Journal column that he's voting for Trump, “warts and all. ” “I think electing Trump would be the   thing we could do this November, better only than electing Clinton to serve as the third term for the Obama administration's radical policies,” he said. (May 9, 2016) Eric Cantor: YEACantor, the former U. S. representative from Virginia and House majority leader, says he will back Trump, though he offered a tepid endorsement, saying a   matchup was “probably not the best choice for anybody,” and adding, “He's a businessman . . . [but] he's been on so many sides of every issue that you never know. ” (May 9, 2016) Ben Carson: YEACarson, a relative political newcomer who ran for president in 2016, has become one of Trump's most prominent surrogates, despite repeatedly voicing misgivings about the candidate. Rick Santorum: YEAThe former Pennsylvania senator and   presidential candidate appeared, with Mike Huckabee, at a Trump rally back in January, when they were ostensibly rivals. (Both Santorum and Huckabee already seemed finished by then.) Despite Santorum's strong social conservatism, he says that after “a long    with Trump” he is “100 percent” endorsing the nominee. (May 25, 2016) Karl Rove: UNDECIDEDThe former George W. Bush strategist and current Wall Street Journal columnist and PAC boss has called Trump  “a complete idiot” who is “graceless and divisive. ” (Trump, in turn, has asked, “Is he not the dumbest human being on earth? ”) But The NY Times reports the two men met in May. (June 3, 2016) Larry Pressler: NAYA moderate and former   senator from South Dakota, Pressler has endorsed Clinton for president.

(August 30, 2016) Bill Kristol: SOFT NAYThe editor of The Weekly Standard threw his lot in with the #NeverTrump crowd with gusto, and he's been a leading advocate for a   alternative. But these days, he seems a bit confused about what exactly the word “never” means: “I mean, I guess never say never. On the one hand, I'll say #NeverTrump, and on the other hand, I'll say never say never. I'll leave it ambiguous. ” (May 2, 2016) Ross Douthat: NAYAfter spending the primary alternately criticizing Trump and forecasting his doom, the NY Times columnist seems especially dyspeptic and despairing. (May 5, 2016) Erick Erickson: NAYThe radio host, editor of The Resurgent, and former RedState editor writes: “Clinton is unfit for the Presidency, but so is Trump. Some Republicans may decide it is time to be a team player, but I will put my country before my party and decline to help the voters in this country commit national suicide. ” (May 4, 2016) Leon Wolf: NAYWolf, the editor of RedState, has been a prominent Trump critic. He says he's leaning toward voting for a Libertarian candidate. “I genuinely believe that Clinton would be a better President than Trump, and it's not close,” he wrote. “That said, Hillary would also be a terrible President, there's no doubt about that. ” He also called on Senate Republicans to confirm Merrick Garland, Obama's Supreme Court nominee, lest Trump do the choosing instead.

Joe Scarborough: UNDECIDED (was SOFT YEA) The MSNBC host and token network conservative was among the friendliest voices in the media toward Trump during the Republican primary. He has been more critical since then. Referring to Trump's attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel, he announced to Republicans, “You have to start calling him out and saying you'll retract your endorsement of him today or else the USA Senate is in danger. ” A day before, he compared Trump's remarks to the Nazi Nuremberg race laws.

(May 23, 2016) Glenn Beck: NAYBeck, the talker who was a Cruz backer, has remained steadfastly opposed to Trump since he became the presumptive nominee.

(May 4, 2016) Rupert Murdoch: YEAThe hugely influential conservative mogul —  owner of The Wall Street Journal, Fox News, and the NY Post —  suggested in March that the Republicans coalesce around Trump: As predicted, Trump reaching out to make peace with Republican ”establishment”. If he becomes inevitable party would be mad not to unify. The coverage of Trump late in the primary led Ted Cruz to lash out and accuse Murdoch  Co. of aiding Trump. Max Boot: NAYBoot, a leading neoconservative and military historian, says that although he's a lifelong Republican, the party is dead and he won't vote for Trump: “The risk of Trump winning, however remote, represents the biggest national security threat that the USA faces today. ” While “Clinton would be far preferable to Trump,” Boot says that right now “I only know one thing for sure: I won't vote for Trump. ” (June 3, 2016) Michael Reagan: YEA (was NAY) The son of former President Ronald Reagan, an influential   host and writer, says he will back Trump in order to stop Clinton.

You should be too if you are a conservative. ” (July 31, 2016) Hewitt softened on Trump in the aftermath of the Orlando attack, writing in a Washington Post column that his focus on security shows that he's potentially preferable to Clinton. (June 15, 2016) Hewitt had taken an unusually hard line against Trump, not only declining to support him but, in the wake of Trump's comments about Judge Gonzalo Curiel, actually calling for the Republican National Convention to jettison Trump as nominee. (June 8, 2016) Robert Kagan: NAYKagan, a leading neoconservative historian and writer, was among the first conservatives to back Clinton, writing way back in February, “For this former Republican, and perhaps for others, the only choice will be to vote for Clinton. The party cannot be saved, but the country still can be. ” He later wrote of Trump, “This is how fascism comes to America. ” (February 25, 2016) Bret Stephens: NAYThe deputy editor of The Wall Street Journal, a Pulitzer   columnist, says he will not vote for Trump, but will probably not vote for Clinton. “Probably none of the above,” he told Hugh Hewitt. “I will never vote for Trump. I have a very, very hard time voting for Mrs. Clinton. ” But Stephens added: “I think that for the USA, Clinton, as awful as I find her, is a survivable event. I'm not so sure about Trump. ” (June 17, 2016) Greg Mankiw: NAYMankiw, an economist at Harvard who chaired George W.

He won fair and square. ” (May 5, 2016) Paul Singer: NAYThe major Republican donor, who backed Marco Rubio and contributed to   efforts, will not back Trump but also won't vote for Clinton.

Charles and David Koch: SOFT NAYPrior to Trump's becoming the presumptive Republicans nominee, Charles Koch said he thought Clinton might be a better president than Trump, though he made no indication that the famed pair of brothers would back her.

Boone Pickens: YEAThe Oklahoma oil billionaire —  and recent   fanatic —  is a former Jeb Bush backer, but Pickens now supports Trump, citing his support for Trump's ban on Muslim immigration. “Yes, I'm for Trump   …     I'm tired of having politicians as president of the U. S.,” he told The Wall Street Journal. He will host a fundraiser for a   super PAC. (May 12, 2016) Foster Friess: YEAThe former Rick Santorum bankroller has decided to back Trump, telling The Hill that Trump can't be judged either by his past stances and behaviors or by what he does and says now. “My success came from harnessing people's strengths and ignoring their weaknesses,” he said. “And also, from assessing people not according to their pasts or where they are today, but rather based on what they can become. ” (May 23, 2016) Woody Johnson: YEAThe NY Jets owner was a major donor to Mitt Romney in 2012 and to Jeb Bush's Right to Rise super PAC —  as well as for John McCain and George W.

Whitman's announcement isn't a total surprise —  she suggested at a   confab in June she might back Clinton —  but is striking, since she was finance chair for a Republican presidential candidate, Chris Christie, this year. (August 3, 2016) Seth Klarman: NAYA billionaire financier and   honcho, Klarman is an independent who has mostly given to Republicans, including Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, and Jeb Bush.

58432,80113,Apeirophobia: The Fear of Eternity,Atlantic,Bobby Azarian,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, The first time I thought about heaven, it terrified me. I was 4 years old, and my grandfather had just passed away after a   battle with cancer. My family tried to console me by explaining that he went to a beautiful, calm, and happy place, where he would be united with all his loved ones, forever and ever. That night, I lay in bed in pitch darkness and tried to grasp what they had told me. But every time I thought I had a grip on eternity, it slipped further away. The largest number of years I could imagine failed to make a dent in infinity. My primitive brain filled with an existential angst. The idea of living forever was even more unsettling than the idea of no longer existing after death. Woody Allen once said, “Eternity is a very long time, especially toward the end!” Eternity sounds great on the surface, but actually experiencing it may be an entirely different matter. For some people, the very notion of infinity sends chills up the spine. In fact, for many who suffer from “apeirophobia” —  a term for the fear of eternity —  the thought of an existence that goes on forever amounts to torture. “I remember the first time it hit me,” writes Kellie, the username of an anonymous commenter on the pop culture website YOMYOMF, which featured a brief story about an actor's experience with apeirophobia . “I was around 8 years old. Now I'm in my 30s, and the thought of eternity still freaks me out. It usually hits at night when I'm trying to sleep. I've learned to push it out of my mind, but sometimes I can't, and when that happens I start pacing the room and thinking that I might have to go to the emergency room or else I might kill myself. ” Search for apeirophobia on Google and you'll find hundreds, if not thousands, of   posts and comments similar to this on popular Internet forums like Reddit, Quora, and Yahoo! Answers. Websites dedicated to phobia help and support, such as Phobia Fear Release and MedHelp, all have comment threads on apeirophobia, too. On these sites, Apeirophobes share experiences and swap advice. Even though most describe dealing with unrelenting anxiety, many seem comforted by knowing they aren't alone. Despite all this discussion, there is so little research on apeirophobia that it lacks its own Wikipedia entry. It is not explicitly recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the American Psychiatric Association's standard reference for psychiatry, but it does meet their criteria for a “specific phobia,” which is classified as an anxiety disorder. It is included on many sites with informal phobia lists, but it is absent from the websites of the Mayo Clinic and the National Institute of Mental Health, as well as WebMD. A Google Scholar search doesn't yield a single quantitative study on the phobia. Grasping for some sense of its prevalence, I posted on Facebook, asking if anyone had experience with apeirophobia. I received considerably more responses than expected. One friend said that he used to get so overwhelmed during sermons in early adolescence that he felt physically sick. Another wrote, “The thought of eternity still fills me with anxiety when I wake up from naps. My solution: I stopped napping. ” Where does this fear come from? A realization that an eternal afterlife could become infinitely repetitive? The recognition that one lacks control over their own destiny? Martin Wiener, a former colleague of mine at George Mason University who researches the neural underpinnings of time perception, notes that the brain region hypothesized to control   planning, the frontal lobe, is one of the last to develop in humans as they grow. “In adolescence, there is a dawning realization that occurs where one realizes they will become an adult,” Wiener says. “I suspect that, in apeirophobia, one comes to the ‘realization' that after death you will live forever (if you believe this) and in simulating that experience in your mind, one realizes that there is no way to project ahead to ‘forever' —  and that experience is, inherently,  . As such, the anxiety that these folks are feeling may not be much different than the fear of growing up, getting old, or death. ” Maybe human brains, as finite instruments with limited cognitive and computational capacities, are   not hardwired to have a conception of something completely absent from sensory experience. Evolution has done just fine without organisms that contemplate infinity, after all. Doing so wouldn't have likely offered any survival advantages to   humans. Wiener's explanation would predict that apeirophobia creeps up in younger stages of life, and although we cannot know anything for sure without sufficient data, the reports scattered across the web seem to roughly match this concept. But there does seem to be a small percentage of people with apeirophobia who first experienced fear even before adolescence, such as myself. For that, Wiener offers a different —  but likely compatible —  idea regarding the phenomenon: What if a fear of the afterlife is simply a religious manifestation of a fear of death that's innate in everyone? “Terror Management Theory, which is derived from Ernest Becker's 1973 Pulitzer   work of philosophy and psychology The Denial of Death, essentially says people in modern civilization are all walking around in denial of our mortality —  and that culture, religion, and entertainment all exist for the purpose of distraction,” Wiener explains. “The idea is that these things keep us from thinking about our own deaths, and that systematically, people are repressing this fear. The fear of eternity could just be that same fear manifesting itself in a different way. ” There shouldn't be too many atheists who fear of eternity, since they reject the idea of an afterlife, Wiener says. But that doesn't mean that those who aren't religious are immune to existential anxiety. Infinity, after all, doesn't pertain only to time it can also apply to space. “I feel that we are all insignificant compared to the universe,” wrote Jamie Adkins, a nurse and longtime friend of mine, in response to my Facebook post. “When I start to think beyond our solar system, it is as if my thoughts automatically stop to protect myself from having some form of a panic attack. The knowledge of black holes will give me nightmares for days. The thought of the distance between galaxies is unbearable. ” She likened the experience to Horton Hears a Who. “We are on this tiny flower and can be blown away any second. ” It's an   anxiety. In the 17th century, the French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal described in Pensées, how both infinite space and time shook him to the core: “When I consider the short duration of my life, swallowed up in the eternity before and after, the little space which I fill, and even can see, engulfed in the infinite immensity of spaces of which I am ignorant, and which know me not, I am frightened, and am astonished at being here rather than there for there is no reason why here rather than there, why now rather than then. ” Bilbo Baggins, burdened with unusually long life thanks to the almighty ring in Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, put it this way: “I feel thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread. ” Although some apeirophobics have benefitted from treatments like medication and cognitive behavioral therapy, others have found no way to mitigate the existential terror. Personally, I'm no better at grasping infinity than I was at 4. But rather than trying to comprehend eternity, now I just avoid the thought altogether.

Shifting Heads of State: Gambian President Yahya Jammeh conceded his country's election today after an upset victory by Adama Barrow. Jammeh, who's ruled for 22 years, took power in a 1994 coup and has long been accused of crushing dissent —  but not this time, apparently. Over in France, President François Hollande announced on Thursday that he won't seek reelection next year. Since 2012, when Hollande was elected on a message of change, his ratings have plummeted to 4 percent as a wave of terrorist attacks hit the country. Meanwhile, Austrians are preparing to vote this Sunday in a   rerun of their May presidential election. The   Freedom Party appealed that result, citing improper handling of postal ballots, after losing by a tiny margin. Right now, in the second round, the race is still too close to call. As For the U. S. Election: Democrats are still trying to make sense of Clinton's defeat. She got fewer votes than Obama did in 2012, and her critics say that's evidence of her campaign's failures —  but a closer look at the numbers shows a more complicated picture. What's the point of dissecting Clinton's campaign again? Whatever's revealed about the success of her strategies could guide her party as it chooses new leadership: Keith Ellison, the progressive Minnesota rep who's running for DNC chair, stands at the center of the party's struggle to reconcile economic populism and identity politics. And Back to the Cabinet: The   has announced James Mattis as his choice for secretary of defense. Mattis is a retired Marine general and an outspoken critic of Obama's policy in the Middle East. As for policy at home, another one of Trump's picks —  Betsy DeVos, nominated for education secretary —  is expected to downsize the   branch of the Department of Ed. Here are three education experts' perspectives on what that might mean. Jay Hamilton, a communications professor, explains how the economics of journalism create information bubbles. Mackenzie Davis, an actress, discusses how she portrays the complex friendships between women in the new film Always Shine. Dava Sobel, a science writer, describes how in the 1880s, a group of female astronomers at Harvard paved the way for women in science —  while also charting the galaxy. Maria Reva's short story “Novostroïka,” from our December issue, centers on a Ukrainian family of 14 living in an apartment with no heat: “Come look, we get barely any gas,” Aunt Lena said. She wore a yellowed apron over a   fur coat. Its massive hood obscured her face. “Took me three hours to boil potatoes. ” She turned the knobs to maximum the elements quivered with a faint blue. “Did you go to the city council? They should look into it. ” “It seems they already have,” Daniil said. “They're just better at turning things off than on. ” Aunt Lena's daughter jumped out from under the kitchen table, singing, “May there always be sunshine   May there always be blue skies. ” She   at the lightbulb hanging from the ceiling. Aunt Lena tickled the nape of the child's neck, and she retreated back under the table. “What did they tell you at the council? ,” Aunt Lena asked. “The building doesn't exist, and we don't live here. ” Keep reading here. Unfortunately, a recent study shows, the simple act of reading fiction won't immediately improve your sense of empathy —  but that doesn't mean literature can't still showcase an enormous range of human emotion and character.

Answers: zimbabwe, 38. 1 billion, piano, A reader shares her reaction to a recent study on sexual assaults committed by women: I am incredibly grateful to see research and coverage of this undiscussed epidemic. I was trafficked as a child and about a third of my rapists were women. I cringe when I hear most people talk about rape culture, because the mere existence of female perpetrators and male rape victims is so rarely considered. . .. I feel so alienated by the feminist movement because so many feminists are very dismissive of my attempt to even discuss the existence of female perpetrators because it is so against the stereotypical image of what a rapist looks like. It is true that not all men are rapists, just as it is true that not all women are rapists. Just as not all humans are horribly predatory. It is tragic to comprehend the lack of services and sympathy that are available to male rape victims, perpetuated by this stigma that men aren't raped and women don't rape. Female rape victims already face such obstacles in reporting —  but almost all of the male rape victims I know faced complete incredulity from the police when they reported. Read more here.

It's hardly remembered now, having been overshadowed a few months later on September 11, but the George W. Bush administration's first   crisis came in the South China Sea. On April 1, 2001, a U. S. Navy surveillance plane collided with a Chinese jet near Hainan Island. The pilot of the Chinese jet was killed, and the American plane was forced to land and its crew was held hostage for 11 days, until a diplomatic agreement was worked out.   relations remained tense for some time. China's Great Leap Backward, Unlike Bush, Trump didn't need to wait to be inaugurated to set off a crisis in the relationship. He managed that on Friday, with a phone call to the president of Taiwan, Tsai  . It's a sharp breach with protocol, but it's also just the sort that underscores how weird and incomprehensible some important protocols are. Trump's call was first reported by the Financial Times, but the Trump campaign soon confirmed it and issued a readout of the conversation:   Trump spoke with President Tsai   of Taiwan, who offered her congratulations. During the discussion, they noted the close economic, political, and security ties exists between Taiwan and the USA.   Trump also congratulated President Tsai on becoming President of Taiwan earlier this year. Why would Trump not speak with Tsai? Here's where the strangeness starts. The U. S. maintains a strong “unofficial” relationship with Taiwan, including providing it with “defensive” weapons, while also refusing to recognize its independence and pressuring Taiwanese leaders not to upset a fragile but functional status quo. It's the sort of fiction that is obvious to all involved, but on which diplomacy is built: All parties agree to believe in the fiction for the sake of getting along. The roots of this particular fiction date to 1949, when Chiang  's Republic of China was routed by Mao Zedong and the Communists, and Chiang fled to Taiwan. The U. S. in Cold War mode, continued to recognize the ROC in Taiwan as China's rightful government, and so did the United Nations. But in 1971, the UN changed course, recognizing the People's Republic of China —  or as it was often called then, Red China —  as the legitimate government. In 1979, the USA followed suit. Crucially, the communiqué proclaiming that recognition noted, “The Government of the USA acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China. ” Officially, this has also been the policy of Taiwan for almost a quarter century. Under the 1992 Consensus, another artful diplomatic fiction, both Taipei and Beijing agreed that there was only one China and agreed to disagree on which was legitimate, as well as maintaining two separate systems. During the Bush years, the U. S. said it would defend Taiwan in an attack, but Bush also pushed back on Taiwanese moves toward independence. Despite recognizing the PRC, the U. S. has kept close ties with Taiwan since 1979. The State Department notes that “Taiwan is the USA' ninth largest trading partner, and the USA is Taiwan's second largest trading partner. ” More importantly, the U. S. has sold some $46 billion in arms to Taiwan since 1990, which are intended as defensive. Last December, the Obama administration sold $1. 8 billion in   missiles, warships, and other materiel to Taipei. Of course, the “defensive” purpose to all of this is against China, the most plausible aggressor against Taiwan. Naturally, the arms sales have consistently annoyed the Chinese. (Recently, China has been on a campaign of   and   across the South China Sea, trying to assert greater control and influence.) Though the triangle between the U. S. China, and Taiwan sometimes flares up, the general goal of all three has been to maintain the fragile status quo. By speaking to President Tsai, and praising U. S. relations with Taiwan, Trump threatens to upset that delicate balance. Reaction to the call was immediate and, for the most part, aghast. “The Chinese leadership will see this as a highly provocative action, of historic proportions,” Evan Medeiros, former Asia director at the White House National Security Council, told the FT. “Regardless if it was deliberate or accidental, this phone call will fundamentally change China's perceptions of Trump's strategic intentions for the negative. With this kind of move, Trump is setting a foundation of enduring mistrust and strategic competition for U. S.  relations. ” Ari Fleischer, Bush's first White House press secretary, noted that he wasn't even allowed to refer to a Taiwanese government. My colleague James Fallows, not generally a man given to overreaction or   was blunter: “WHAT THE HELL? ???” he tweeted. As is typically the case with Trump, it's hard to tell whether this blithe overturning of protocol is intentional or simply a result of not knowing, or caring, better. There are various reasons Trump might be intentionally poking China. Trump spoke harshly about China throughout his presidential campaign, accusing Beijing of currency manipulation,   and taking advantage of the USA. He also showed a willingness, if not an eagerness, to slaughter nearly every sacred cow of American foreign policy. Some Trump confidants have suggested existing policy on Taiwan should become one of them. John Bolton, who served as Bush's ambassador to the UN, has been advising Trump, and Bolton has been a very public advocate of the U. S. cozying up to Taiwan in order to show strength against China. Even if the provocation is intentional, that doesn't mean Trump has acted wisely. “I would guess that   Trump does not really comprehend how sensitive Beijing is about this issue,” Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told The Hill. Some observers suggested that the call fits with the pattern of Trump intertwining his business and political interests, pointing out that he's currently seeking to open luxury hotels in Taiwan. But it's also possible that Trump just stumbled into the matter, Being  . Trump tweeted Friday evening that Tsai had called him, presenting himself as just the guy who picked up the handset. It's unclear how studied the decision to take it was, or whether it was studied at all. Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, assailed Trump for not taking it seriously. “Foreign policy consistency is a means, not an end. It's not sacred. Thus, it's Trump's right to shift policy, alliances, strategy,” Murphy said in a pair of tweets. “What has happened in the last 48 hours is not a shift. These are major pivots in foreign policy   any plan. That's how wars start. ” It's also hard to know how big a deal Trump's call is. China did not immediately comment. A White House official told The NY Times that the administration was only informed of the call after the fact, and said the fallout could be significant. There were other questions. Wouldn't Beijing see that what Trump did was a blunder, but not a major shift in policy? Isn't the Chinese government sophisticated enough not to take Trump at face value? Trump's previous conversations might provide hints on whether foreign governments will take Trump seriously. As Uri Friedman wrote today, Trump's conversation with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has already had repercussions. The Pakistani government put out a readout that read suspiciously like a   transcript of Trump's words, capturing the tone the   uses. His promise to “play any role that you want me to play to address and find solutions to the outstanding problems” might sound to an American who just observed the election as so much Trumpian   but it made headlines in Pakistan, where some interpreted it as a nod to Pakistan's conflict with India in Kashmir. Hussain Haqqani, Pakistan's former ambassador to the USA, told the Times it appeared Pakistani officials had taken Trump's words too seriously. China is perhaps a more sophisticated   player than Pakistan it's certainly a more important one. But as Fallows points out, a China that sees Trump as buffoon probably isn't good for American interests either. For the time being, the most important thing to watch is probably for Beijing's announcement. That will be the first clue as to whether Trump's phone call will set in motion a huge realignment of American policy and relationships with China and Taiwan —  or if it will be another Hainan Island incident, barely remembered 15 years on."
59925,82008,Can Trump's Defenders Stop Stein's Recounts? ,Atlantic,Clare Foran,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"  Trump's allies are taking legal action intended to stop election recount attempts initiated by Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. In Wisconsin, a   super PAC filed a federal lawsuit arguing that the recount is unconstitutional and “may unjustifiably cast doubt upon the legitimacy of   Donald J. Trump's victory. ” The Atlantic  Politics  Policy Daily: The One Where Trump Calls Taiwan, In Michigan, Attorney General Bill Schuette, a Republican who supported Trump during the election, has filed a lawsuit,  which according to a statement aims “to stop a frivolous request . .. to recount the entire state's presidential election results by hand. ” Lawyers representing Trump have also objected to the Michigan recount request. In Pennsylvania, the Associated Press reports, “Trump and the Pennsylvania Republicans are asking a state court to throw out a   backed request for a recount. ” Stein launched a recount fundraising drive last week, and subsequently filed for recounts in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. In a statement on Friday, Stein vowed to fight the legal challenges. “We won't stand down as Trump and his allies seek to frivolously obstruct the legal processes set up to ensure the accuracy, security and fairness of our elections,” she said. There are a few common themes to most of the legal claims challenging the recount requests: In general, Trump's defenders are arguing that it's too late in the electoral process to initiate vote recounts, and that Stein doesn't have ground to stand on since she didn't come anywhere close to winning the election herself, and has no proof that vote totals were compromised. Whether or not legal action will stop recount efforts from proceeding is another question. “From strongest to weakest where strongest means most likely to stop the recount effort, I would rate them Pennsylvania, then Michigan, then Wisconsin,” Edward Foley, an election law expert at Ohio State University's Moritz College of Law, said, though he cautioned that it's difficult to predict exactly what will happen. “The hardest case to stop the recount seems to be Wisconsin since the federal claims in federal court are more novel and unusual,” he added. Jerry Goldfeder, a professor at Fordham University's School of Law, similarly commented that legal actions against a recount seem most likely to succeed in Pennsylvania. But in an   exchange, Goldfeder, who was a member of Clinton's NY Leadership Council, noted that opposition to the recounts is probably unnecessary since, as he put it, Stein's efforts appear to be “futile. ” That's because whatever happens, the result of the election is almost assuredly not expected to change. There is no conclusive evidence that vote counts have been compromised in any state, and Trump's margin of victory in all three is large enough that it is extremely unlikely that recounts would make a difference in determining who won the election. If legal fights over recounts drag on it might complicate plans for state electors to formally cast their votes on December 19th. But  “as a practical matter, even if these recount efforts caused any of these states to bump up against federal election deadlines, I think all three states will end up being counted for Trump, and I don't foresee this affecting the inauguration,” Foley commented. Attempts to initiate a recount have given Democrats disappointed by the outcome of the election a glimmer of hope, however improbable that hope may be. Calls for a vote audit gained traction on social media after NY Magazine published a report last month asserting that Clinton had been “urged by a group of prominent computer scientists and election lawyers to call for a recount in three swing states won by Trump. ” The fact that Clinton amassed a considerable lead in the popular vote has contributed to a sense among her supporters that the outcome of the election was unfair. And suspicions that there might have been vote tampering have been fueled by the fact that the Obama administration has formally accused Russia of interfering in the U. S. election. “The U. S. Intelligence Community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of   from U. S. persons and institutions, including from U. S. political organizations,” a statement released by the administration in October read.   Yet while Clinton's campaign has agreed to participate in the recount proceedings, a counsel for the campaign noted in a Medium post that they “had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology. ” Trump, meanwhile, has simultaneously denounced recount efforts, and sowed doubts about the legitimacy of the election in his own right. “Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech after the results were in,” the   tweeted last weekend, adding “nothing will change. ” Later, however, he falsely claimed that millions of people voted illegally in the election, an unsubstantiated assertion that he used to suggest that he had unfairly lost the popular vote."

59928,82011,Kafka in the Bull City,Atlantic,David A. Graham,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"DURHAM, N. C. —  There's not a lot of love lost between the North Carolina State Board of Elections and its subordinate board in Durham County these days. Exasperation was written on the faces of the members of the county board Friday morning after they met to consider an NCSBE order that they recount more than 94, 000 votes by Monday evening. The three members of the board huddled in a closed meeting, trying to figure out how to comply with the order. When one member, Democrat Dawn Baxton, emerged briefly from the room, reporters asked how much longer things would take. Baxton suggested the Second Coming might come sooner. When she emerged again, 20 minutes later, Baxton asked whether the press had been praying in her absence. North Carolina's New Rainbow Coalition  It's not the reporters who need prayer: Divine intervention might be the only thing that could allow Durham County to meet a   deadline for the recount. The vaguely Kafkaesque story is a crisp illustration of the friction when state government and local government collide, and how that friction sometimes scrambles partisan lines. The trouble started on election day, when Durham counted those roughly 94, 000 votes late in the night, due to software delays. When they were added to the statewide total, they changed a decent lead for Gov Pat McCrory, a Republican, into a very narrow lead for his challenger, Democrat Roy Cooper. Since then, Cooper's lead has remained consistent, and has even grown a bit, standing at a little more than 10, 000 votes. State Republicans have gone through a series of steps to try to prevent Cooper from being certified as the race's winner. In counties around the state, Republicans filed protests and challenges, alleging ineligible voters and irregularities in counting. Nearly all of those were thrown out, and those decisions were not appealed. But the situation in Durham County has remained unresolved. (It's not the only outstanding issue —  there is also a pair of protests in Bladen County, while a conservative   has filed a suit to try to keep the votes of some   registrants out of the tally.) Tom Stark, a Republican lawyer here, argued that late tabulation of the votes raised questions and was grounds for a hand recount of the county's votes. The McCrory campaign, in turn, announced that it would withdraw a request for a full state recount if Durham County recounted its votes. (That offer may have been a bluff: Candidates can only automatically demand a recount if the margin of the race is less than 10, 000 votes, and McCrory is no longer inside that range.) Under state law, every county board of elections has a   majority for the governor's party and the state board has a   edge, meaning Republicans control the process from top to bottom. (This was also a controversy before the election. After a federal court threw out a voting law and demanded restoration of   days, which are disproportionately used by Democratic voters and especially African Americans, some county boards found other ways to limit hours —  a move urged by the executive director of the state Republicans.) Durham County considered Stark's challenge last month, decided it was without merit, and rejected it unanimously. But Stark appealed to the state board, which held a   meeting Wednesday to consider it. In short, Democrats argued that the fact that Durham County calculated the votes late didn't amount to an “irregularity” in any formal or legal sense, and that therefore there wasn't any grounds for granting the recount. Republicans, including Stark, conceded that they had no evidence of malfeasance, but said that a recount couldn't hurt and would only help to instill faith in the cleanliness of elections. (There's a cynical irony to this argument, which is that Republicans in the state have spent the last three years arguing, also without evidence, that elections are tainted by widespread fraud.) The board voted along party lines,   to order that Durham conduct a recount, but decided that could be done via machine rather than by hand, a   measure. That still left unresolved how long the recount might take —  and with that, when the outcome of the governor's race might finally be decided. On Thursday, Durham County Board Chair Bill Brian, a Republican, told The News and Observer he was guessing the recount would be resolved by the end of next week. But later that day, Durham received the formal order for the recount from the state board. The NCSBE demanded that Durham County produce a plan to recount the votes by Friday at noon, and to have the count finished by 7 p. m. on Monday. Thursday night, the Durham County board announced an emergency meeting for first thing Friday morning. Brian is a   burly,   man with a knack for expressive faces —  imagine a sardonic Santa. Friday, he was expressing annoyance, complaining about what he called an “unreasonable” order from the state board. When the board emerged from a closed session, Brian announced that it was requesting an extension of the deadline for the recount to 7 p. m. on Wednesday, and asking for an emergency state board hearing to grant it. Brian then explained the litany of complications attending the state board's order. In order to count the ballots, the county is supposed to have teams of two supervising each voting machine used to recount votes, and each team is ideally comprised of one Democrat and one Republican. The board was finalizing a plan to use 26 machines, so that means they needed 52 people —  52 people who would work long shifts the entire weekend for the princely sum of $13 per hour. Even if they were able to find full crews, given an estimated 13 seconds per ballot, a     calculation suggests it would take around 13 hours to count all of the ballots. So far, so good. But Durham County first has to get employees of the company that makes the voting machines to certify them. Brian had also read in local media that he was supposed to appear at a state board meeting on Saturday, though he'd received no notice. As a result, the board expected that they could start counting no sooner than Sunday morning. Even then, 13 hours would put the board comfortably ahead of 7 p. m. Monday, right? Well, no. Because the NCSBE had ordered Durham County to count not just the governor's race but every race, employees would then have to tally   votes for every seat, down to    commissioner separately. Brian estimated that would take another 36 hours. “Somebody always has a great idea, oh, we'll just bring in new machines,” Brian said. But he rejected that, too: For every new machine, the board would have to find a new pair of workers —  one Democrat, one Republican —    them, and pay them. (Brian   invited the members of the state board to come chip in, pointing out that would guarantee at least three Republicans and two Democrats.) Even if there were plenty of applicants, it did not appear that the board of elections could plug in all 26 machines at its building without overloading the building's circuits electricians scurried around the room during the conversation trying to test the system. The board couldn't just move the machines to another county building, though, because then they'd have to come up with a security plan for moving the ballots and locking them up overnight. That, of course, would require more money. The board was guessing the whole process, which almost no one expects to change the result of the contest, would run $35, 000 to $40, 000. It was a rare point of certainty. “Right now, the money is coming out of the pockets of the people of Durham County,” Brian said. “At the end of the day, that's the one thing we do know. ” Brian doesn't seem like the type to lose his temper, but there was no question about his frustration. Baxton sat to Brian's right, scowling. Margaret Cox Griffin, the third member, sat to the left, expressionless. Marie Inserra, a lawyer for the county, sat quietly for 25 minutes, before unleashing a furious outburst at the state for failing to upgrade software when it had a chance. “The order that we received from the state board was an order that, it seems to me, was designed to cause us to fail,” Brian said. “Everybody knows this [process]. It's no different for the state than it is for us or any other county. ” Although as Brian drily noted last week, “Everything is politically motivated in an election,” the tussle between Durham County and the state board doesn't really break along party lines. Despite the partisan structure of the county board, its members have an incentive to appear to the local community untainted by political consideration. They'd considered the Stark complaint, found it wanting, and rejected it. Yet the state board, which seemed untroubled by the plain   vote, had come in and overruled them. That wasn't just a   reversal it made Durham County look bad by suggesting there might be foul play. Even worse, the brunt of that decision was landing on the county board and its employees, who were getting ready to work all weekend to conduct a recount they didn't they could finish to achieve a result that likely wouldn't matter. Brian even took a mild swipe at the state Republicans, which had asked for a hand recount. Brian said that would create a logistical nightmare —  and then mused that perhaps that was the point. Brian wouldn't say   that meeting the NCSBE deadline was impossible but everything else he said telegraphed it. “I'd rather not go on record saying that. I don't know how we can get it done. No one yet has presented a plan that can get it done by 7 p. m. on Monday. ” Nonetheless, he said he expected the state board to reject Durham County's request. And what would happen then if Durham County failed to meet the deadline? “We have no idea,” Brian said. “Maybe I'll go to jail!” It was hard to know for certain, but it appeared that Brian might prefer incarceration to his current plight."
59929,82012,Lessons From Trump's ‘Fantastic' Phone Call to Pakistan,Atlantic,Uri Friedman,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"This week, the U. S.   spoke with the Pakistani prime minister and, according to the Pakistani government's account of the conversation, delivered the following message: Everything is awesome. It was, arguably, the most surprising presidential phone call since George H. W. Bush got pranked by that pretend Iranian president. Pakistan, Trump reportedly told Nawaz Sharif, is a “fantastic” country full of “fantastic” people that he “would love” to visit as president. Sharif was described as “terrific. ” Pakistanis “are one of the most intelligent people,” Trump allegedly added. “I am ready and willing to play any role that you want me to play to address and find solutions to the outstanding problems. ” It's unclear how accurate the Pakistani government's record of the discussion is, though the language does have a Trumpian ring to it (Trump's transition team released a much more subdued summary of the call). But what's surprising about the account is how disconnected it is from the current state of affairs. Everything is not awesome in U. S.  relations. The two countries are the bitterest of friends. They have long clashed over the haven that terrorist groups have found in Pakistan and over U. S. efforts, including drone strikes and the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound, to kill those terrorists. Pakistan, a nation with a growing arsenal of nuclear weapons, is the archenemy of India, another   state and a critical U. S. ally. U. S. officials see Pakistan —  with its weak political institutions and suspected government support for militant groups in Afghanistan and the contested territory of Kashmir —  as an alarming source of regional instability. The suspicion is mutual: Just a fifth of Pakistanis have a favorable view of the USA. Trump himself has argued that Pakistan “is probably the most dangerous” country in the world, and that India needs to serve as “the check” to it. Some are interpreting the phone call as a disaster. “With one phone call, Trump might have upturned America's relationship with both Pakistan and India,” Jeet Heer wrote at the New Republic. But you don't need to reach for the most dramatic potential consequences to appreciate the significance of the exchange between Trump and Sharif. Reports of the call haven't yet remade U. S. alliances in South Asia, but they did generate headlines like this on the front pages of Pakistani newspapers: The reports also provoked a caustic response from the Indian government, which opposes U. S. mediation in its border dispute with Pakistan. “We look forward to the   helping Pakistan address the most outstanding of its outstanding issues: terrorism,” a spokesman for the Ministry of External Affairs said. And, ultimately, they forced Pakistani officials to backpedal after initially publicizing the conversation. “Our relationship with the USA is not about personalities —  it is about institutions,” a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs clarified. In other words, a brief, breezy conversation had real reverberations on the subcontinent. One lesson of the phone call is that words matter, especially in international relations where information is patchy, things get lost in translation, rhetoric is often interpreted as policy, and a government's credibility is only as good as its word. (Think of all the people in the USA puzzling over what policies Trump will pursue as president now imagine trying to do that from Islamabad or New Delhi.) Obama's remark at a press conference about a “red line” against the use of chemical weapons in Syria very nearly compelled him, a year later, to launch air strikes against the Assad regime for violating that red line. George W. Bush's decision to include Iran in an “axis of evil” in his State of the Union address torpedoed U. S.  cooperation on fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. Words needn't be spoken in public to have an impact on world affairs. In 1961, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev met with John F. Kennedy in Vienna and verbally beat the new U. S. president to a pulp. A couple months later, Khrushchev approved the construction of the Berlin Wall —  a move some scholars attribute in part to Khrushchev's perception of Kennedy as weak and inexperienced. For these reasons, as Daniel Drezner notes at the Washington Post, political scientists such as John Mearsheimer and Anne Sartori have found that governments don't bluff or lie to one another as often as one might think (Mearsheimer contends that governments are more likely to deceive their own people). “States often are tempted to bluff, or dissemble, but a state that is caught bluffing acquires a reputation for doing so, and opponents are less likely to believe its future communications,” Sartori writes. “The prospect of acquiring a reputation for lying —  and lessening the credibility of the state's future diplomacy —  keeps statesmen and diplomats honest except when fibs are the most tempting. ” Given all this, Trump's communications style —  his loose talk and impulsiveness his theatrics and bravado his tendency to exaggerate and be untruthful the vague, mixed signals he sends —  would seem to indicate that international crises and chaos lie ahead. They might. But another lesson of Trump's phone call with Sharif is that it's too early to say whether Trump's way with words will prove an asset or liability (or both) on the world stage. Already, foreign leaders are adjusting, however haltingly, to the Trump Era. “We don't have to take each word that Mr. Trump said publicly literally,” an adviser to Japan's prime minister observed recently. In a world in which Trump is taken seriously but not literally, his call with Sharif might not signal that he's going to broker peace in Kashmir or become the first U. S. president to visit Pakistan in a decade. Instead, it could be a sign that he is going to approach relations with Pakistan and India more as a transactional businessman than a traditional American president, looking to strike deals rather than adhere to past precedent. As the Russia expert Fiona Hill recently told me, “I tend to look at Trump as a   mogul. You look at a building and say, ‘I'm just going to tear that down and build up something new.' He's not exactly Mr. Preservationist. ” Similarly, Trump's public demands that NATO members spend more on defense, or risk losing U. S. military protection in the event of Russian aggression, have been criticized as undermining the deterrence mechanism that has helped maintain peace in Europe for seven decades —  the understanding that an attack on one member of the alliance will be considered an attack on all members. But since the U. S. election, NATO's   has joined Trump in calling for increased European defense spending and EU leaders have announced plans to do just that. In making his demands, in wondering aloud, Trump is poised to achieve what his   predecessors in the White House never could: a NATO that is less dependent on U. S. military power. Uncertainty and challenges to convention won't necessarily make the world more dangerous. But they may not make it safer either. One of the key questions of Trump's presidency will be whether the benefits of unpredictability outweigh its costs."
59930,82013,The Pirelli Calendar Shows Fashion Trying to Catch Up,Atlantic,Sophie Gilbert,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"The Pirelli Calendar was created in 1962, when an enterprising advertising executive in London, Derek Forsyth, was pondering ways to boost sales for an Italian tire company. At the time, “girlie” calendars featuring women in various states of undress were popular among mechanics and car manufacturers. Forsyth's idea was to class the format up, bringing fashion models and respected photographers together to produce an artier advertisement for the Pirelli brand. The Pirelli calendar became a hit, unexpectedly uniting the worlds of auto manufacturing and high fashion. But it also became a way for photographers to break new artistic ground, free of edicts from magazine editors or clothing companies. The calendar's goal (after selling tires, naturally) was to capture shifting cultural trends. “‘The Cal,'” Pirelli explains on its site, “aspired to be a sign of changing times. ” This year's calendar, shot by Peter Lindbergh, presents itself as a similarly aspirational and inspirational work. Lindbergh photographed 14 Hollywood actresses (and one Russian academic, presumably for diplomatic reasons) most of whom are over 40. He captured them wearing minimal hair and makeup, in an artistic decision he described as “a cry against the terror of perfection and youth. ” Lindbergh's images are striking: His unretouched models, including Helen Mirren (71) and Julianne Moore (55) radiate poise, confidence, and peace with their physical selves. But the muted fanfare they've received mostly signals how much fashion as an industry —  from the Pirelli Calendar to Vogue —  has fallen behind when it comes to breaking new ground for women. Rather than trailblazing new standards for beauty, the 2017 calendar is a sign that institutions that were once at the forefront of new trends and movements are now struggling to catch up. One symbol of the industry's recent conservatism is Ashley Graham. The      model has been in the business for more than 15 years, and has appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated and in campaigns for Nordstrom, Macy's, Bloomingdale's, and Liz Claiborne. She's the official face of Lane Bryant lingerie. In November, she was honored with a Barbie doll in her image. This week she was announced as the January cover star of British Vogue. That it's taken this long for fashion's most prestigious title to put a   model on its cover —  for Vogue to catch up with Liz Claiborne —  is a sign of how dramatically the cultural zeitgeist has changed. (American Vogue has never featured a   model on its cover, although Italian Vogue featured the models Robyn Lawley, Tara Lynn, and Candice Huffine on its cover in 2011.) It also points at how the internet is redefining standards of beauty more quickly than might ever have been imagined. In 1966, an image from Pirelli's calendar of a woman wearing underwear was deemed so racy at the time that the Vatican complained to the Italian brand. In 1971, Francis Giacobetti included topless women in the calendar for the first time. Although his images seem like dubious representations of female empowerment in retrospect, at the time they were emblematic of changing attitudes about sexuality. While in the first half of the 20th century, eroticism was rarely explicit in fashion, in the 1960s, it became “a playful way of flaunting new moral codes that mocked the hypocrisy of the Establishment,” Rebecca Arnold writes in Fashion, Desire, and Morality. In rejecting the oppression of morality, sexualized images were “a refreshing alternative to the controlled grooming of 1950s couture. ” In 1972, Sarah Moon became the first female photographer to shoot the Pirelli Calendar, and her concept was light years away from Giacobetti's headless, hypersexualized women. Once again, the Pirelli Calendar was seeking to distinguish itself by subverting expectations about sexuality, right at the vanguard of   feminism. In 1987, Terence Donovan returned to shoot his second calendar for the company, choosing to use only black models. At the time, only two black women had ever appeared on the cover of British Vogue. Since the '90s, though, the Pirelli Calendar has mostly reflected an industry still mired in restrictive, eurocentric ideas about what beautiful women look like, and who they should appeal to. Between 1990 and 2015, only two women were hired as photographers, Annie Leibovitz and Inez van Lamsweerde. Meanwhile, movements to broaden the fashion industry's standards of beauty seemed to stall. In 2014, 22 percent of the models in NY Fashion Week were women of color. As body positivity movements gained traction with campaigns like #AskHerMore and #EffYourBeautyStandards, fashion magazines and houses seemed increasingly at odds with public perceptions about beauty. But in 2016, the calendar (once again) made a dramatic shift. Shot by Annie Leibovitz, it featured women chosen for their accomplishments rather than their physical appearance. All were fully clothed with the exception of the comedian Amy Schumer, who posed in her underwear, and the tennis star Serena Williams, seen from behind in an image that expressed her physical power. Many of the other models —  Agnes Gund, Fran Lebowitz, Patti Smith —  were over 60. Pirelli seemed to be recognizing increasing awareness, especially among young women, that standards propagated by the industry tend to be not just unrealistic, but sluggish to respond to their readers' changing demographics. “The Pirelli pivot seems to give real substance to the theory that we are at a flexion point in the public objectification of female sexuality,” Vanessa Friedman wrote in The NY Times. The question, Friedman wondered, was whether Pirelli's decision to dramatically shake up its format was “an example of calculated exploitation of a social trend, a clever attempt to profit from the spirit of the age or a more permanent commitment to change. ” Whichever it was, it was undoubtedly a savvy marketing strategy. The costs of producing each Pirelli Calendar have been estimated at around $2 million, versus the $300 to $350 million in free advertising that the calendar offers the brand. The more consequential the changes to the calendar, the more publicity for Pirelli. But the 2017 calendar, in showing beautiful women without makeup, clambers aboard a train that's very much in motion. In early 2014, after the actress Kim Novak was criticized for her barefaced appearance at the Academy Awards, a number of   users began posting images of themselves without makeup in protest. This makeshift movement somehow turned into #nomakeupselfie, a hashtag encouraging women to post   pictures of themselves online while donating money to Cancer Research, a British charity. The campaign raised £8 million in six days. Meanwhile, in a Lennyletter article earlier this year titled “Time to Uncover,” the singer Alicia Keys announced that she was eschewing makeup after becoming frustrated with “how much women are brainwashed into feeling like we have to be skinny, or sexy, or desirable, or perfect. ” She concluded it by writing, “I don't want to cover up anymore. Not my face, not my mind, not my soul, not my thoughts, not my dreams, not my struggles, not my emotional growth. Nothing. ” After the essay was published, a number of public figures posted their own   photos, and when Keys appeared on The Today Show, her interviewers, Tamron Hall and Al Roker, removed their own makeup live on air. In furthering Keys's message —  that women should be appreciated for all aspects of their selves, not merely their physical appearances —  Pirelli is hoping a movement that's long been felt on social media and among women themselves can turn into good branding, even for a company that's historically benefitted from the promotion of impossible beauty ideals. It's an institution acknowledging that many women reject   benchmarks for what they should be aspiring to. So while Lindbergh's images of Lupita N'yongo, Charlotte Rampling, Nicole Kidman, and Zhang Ziyi capture a sea change that's very much ongoing, they're also a sign that in recent years, fashion as an industry has played a very small part in revolutionizing the way women see themselves."
59931,82014,Always Shine's Sobering Female Rivalry,Atlantic,David Sims,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Sophia Takal's new film Always Shine is an effective, tense psychological thriller with deceptively low stakes: the fate of a friendship between two actresses, played by Caitlin Fitzgerald and Mackenzie Davis. Beth (Fitzgerald) is more pliant and flirty, jovial at auditions, and seems to be booking many more roles than Anna (Davis) who is far blunter and more eager to call out gender discrimination in their line of work. Things between Beth and Anna begin to disintegrate as they take a weekend vacation together. Takal turns their   conversations into a thrill ride, questioning the ways women perform for each other, and the people around them, in an oppressively sexist industry. Always Shine, which is in limited release now and debuts on VOD Friday, is the latest project in a career year for Davis, who (unlike her character) is one of Hollywood's most intriguing new stars. Curiously enough, her biggest roles in 2016 —  in Always Shine, the AMC tech drama Halt and Catch Fire, and the new season of Netflix's Black Mirror —  involve tumultuous but layered female friendships, a   theme in mainstream pop culture. In October, Davis appeared in “San Junipero,” the most widely praised installment of the third season of Black Mirror, as the awkward, lovelorn Yorkie. The rare Black Mirror episode to present a slightly hopeful take on the future of technology, “San Junipero” saw Yorkie navigating a virtual world in search of love, then struggling to reconcile her new connection with the   Kelly (Gugu  ) with her much more circumscribed lifestyle in the real world. Black Mirror's ‘San Junipero' is the Standout of the Season, Also hinging on a complex relationship between two women is Halt and Catch Fire, which aired its brilliant third season this year. Davis's first major role was playing the lovable and deeply frustrating programmer Cameron Howe, who attempts to navigate the burgeoning tech scene of the '80s —  and all of its institutional sexism —  with her business partner Donna (Kerry Bishé). Their relationship has its share of conflicts, though they don't arise over a man, or some manufactured twist in the women's love lives. Instead, Halt and Catch Fire takes care to make their differences of opinion feel organic, rooted in their wider views of the world. “There's nobody getting knifed,” Davis told me. “It's people breaking your trust, small moments becoming a huge deal. ” A much more   work, Always Shine puts an edgier spin on a similar dynamic —  an intense female friendship —  with a script drawn from   experience. “[The film's  ] Sophia Takal is extremely open . .. about her vulnerabilities and her demons, her competitiveness, her jealousy, things she feels insecure about,” Davis said. “It felt embarrassing how much I connected to [the script]. I felt like someone was portraying me in a very honest way. ” The movie has the same nightmarish feel as Ingmar Bergman's Persona, or David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, in which the identities of both female leads begin to meld as their personal rivalry grows. Takal's script builds its psychological tension around the anxieties Beth and Anna perceive in each other she plays with, and subverts, the appearances actresses often have to maintain as they try to break into the film industry. “The sort of poisonous female friendship that's depicted in Always Shine, it's not the cause of the movie. It's the result of an environment that tells women that they're supposed to be a certain way or they have failed,” Davis said. “They're constantly trying to fit themselves into smaller, tighter, more perfect boxes. And when they see somebody doing it effortlessly, it's this indictment against them for not doing it the right way. And I have absolutely had that experience, and I knew Sophia had. ” As with so much art of the moment, it's hard not to draw parallels to the election. For Davis, the ideas about gender and social expectations that undergird Always Shine were magnified in media coverage of the former presidential candidate, Clinton. “She's been criticized her entire public life for being too much or not enough in any direction, and there's no place she can land where it's just silent,” Davis said of the critiques Clinton received for her image, including how much or how little she was smiling. “There are thousands of politicians that don't have to receive the level of . .. vitriol that she does. ” In Always Shine, the effort to project the right image becomes a dark competition. As Beth and Anna vie for attention both from Hollywood executives and from the patrons of a local bar near their weekend getaway, their interactions become malicious. “I think it's cool to make [their dynamic] as active and dangerous as Sophia makes it, instead of this purely internal experience of trying to adjust and exercise in a different way,” Davis said. “There are so many   things for women, and finding that narrow groove in which it's okay for you to exist, is going to cause someone to explode. And this movie is about that explosion. ” Throughout her burgeoning career, Davis has been unafraid to reckon with those kinds of explosion and their aftermath —  and Always Shine is one of her boldest achievements yet."
59932,82015,The Playground Where Babies Learn to Talk,Atlantic,Emily DeRuy,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"OAKLAND, Calif. —  At first, the playground at Officer Willie Wilkins Park looks pretty standard. There's a slide to skid down, ramps to climb up, bridges to cross, and nooks to investigate. But there's also something relatively unusual: words, and lots of them. Mixed in among the bright primary colors of the structure are white panels plastered with whimsical illustrations and phrases like “let's talk about the sunshine” and “let's talk about food. ” They're not a random addition the panels are a deliberate attempt to foster early language and brain development in babies and toddlers. The park sits in the eastern part of the city, in a neighborhood with high poverty rates and low educational attainment. Studies suggest that a   “word gap” exists between   and   children: Poor children hear, understand, and use fewer words, which can have   negative consequences. Babies who hear fewer words are less likely to do well in school and kids who drop out of school are less likely to be healthy adults. In the last several years, initiatives small and large have emerged that are aimed at shrinking these language disparities and providing parents, particularly those without resources, tools to engage meaningfully with their babies. Often, these programs have been implemented at hospitals and clinics (which is happening in Oakland, too) where trusted adults like doctors and nurses deliver messages about the importance of talking with babies. And playground developers say they've always tried to foster learning. But using informal playtime to address the inequality specifically and in a concerted,   way is a relatively new idea. This park with its conversation prompts and emphasis on talking opened just several months ago. (The playground itself existed previously, but just as a typical play structure.) It's a project of Too Small to Fail, a joint initiative of the ClintonFoundation and the Opportunity Institute that is also supported by local nonprofits. (The Atlantic's Next America Early Childhood project receives funding from the   Foundation, which also provides grants to Too Small to Fail.) The basic idea is that parents and other caregivers can use the panels (they're   so that parents who aren't literate themselves can still participate) to spark conversations with their kids while they play. The panels, developed with the help of Goodby Silverstein, the ad agency behind the ubiquitous “got milk?” campaign, don't get in the way of more traditional    play. But they're also accessible and located near seats, so that adults don't have to squeeze through   tunnels or scramble up ladders to see them. “We know this kind of interaction can really make a difference,” said Kara Dukakis, the   of Too Small to Fail, during a recent visit to the park around 10 a. m. on a chilly Tuesday morning. Of course, most parents know they are supposed to talk and interact with their kids, and the vast majority do on a regular basis. But, Dukakis said, some are looking for guidance on what to say and how to say it. Where a parent might typically only participate in a child's park experience by saying “Stay where I can see you” or “Don't climb so high,” the hope is that the panels will prompt a parent to see playtime as a time for    conversation, also. The prompts are intentionally   so that one parent (or brother or grandmother or babysitter) might see the “let's talk about food” panel and ask a child about the color and shape of the grapes she's holding, while another might ask his kids whether they'd prefer green beans or squash as a side at dinner. Some of the signs are in Spanish, since the neighborhood has shifted heavily Latino over the years. They encourage parents to engage with their kids in whatever language they are most comfortable using —  it's not English that matters, but the number and breadth of words in any language. Another panel prompts parents to talk about feelings, an attempt to help kids understand and process their emotions. The goal is to meet children and their caregivers where they already are, in places like parks and grocery stores and laundromats, and to show them how they can work talking and singing and reading into activities they already do, not to create more work for families where parents are often juggling several jobs with childrearing. Carla Keener, a senior administrator at First 5 Alameda County, an early partner of Too Small to Fail's work in Oakland, pointed out that “some parents feel vulnerable reading or talking or singing. ” Placing the prompts in a park and making them accessible to everyone hopefully signals to parents, including fathers who may be less likely to encounter similar prompts at a doctor's visit or in a grocery store (other tactics the campaign is utilizing) that “it's okay” to rely on the prompts for guidance, she said. Parents, Keener added, need to hear the positive message that they are vital, capable teachers, which isn't necessarily common in this part of town. The prompts are meant to empower parents and reinforce positive behavior (in this case talking, reading, and singing with their children) not to be judgmental or preachy. “Play is the great equalizer for everyone,” said John McConkey of Landscape Structures, which helped build the playground. “It's easy for the parents to participate and interact. It doesn't feel so prescriptive or institutional. We're having fun. We're making things up as we go. The use of a play environment lets people just relax and have fun, and they don't realize they're really learning and educating they're just having fun. ” There will soon be around 30 such playgrounds across the country. They're designed to reflect the surrounding communities, so that a structure in a farming town might have panels that prompt conversations about animals and crops. Several Head Start facilities, the federally backed   program, have them. And Landscape Structures is interested in incorporating panels into playgrounds beyond those it develops with Too Small to Fail. It's too early to tell exactly what the impact of the panels will be, but Dukakis and others say they want to see parents engaging with children early and often. Recent research suggests that similar interventions (signs in supermarkets prompting parents to interact with children, such as a picture of a carton of milk and a cow with the phrase “Where does milk come from? ”) increase the amount and quality of conversation, particularly for   families.   children are more likely to hear directives, such as “Don't touch that!” or “Get the milk!” where   children are more likely to be engaged in conversations —  about milk coming from cows, for instance. The signage in the grocery store seemed to prompt families in a   neighborhood to engage in the types of conversations more typically heard in   neighborhoods. It's possible evaluations will show the panels in the park prompt positive increases in dialogue, too. Some researchers have questioned the power of   initiatives and suggested that they might sound nice, but don't do enough to address poverty, a lack of parental leave, and other issues. Yet proponents point out that talking and reading with kids is never a bad thing, and the initiatives can be part of a larger focus on early childhood. Too many people still think of young children as “blobs” or “blank slates” that acquire knowledge later, Keener said, when, in fact, significant and fundamental brain development happens in the first few years of life. “I think people are still throwing away those first three, first five years,” she said. “That's such a rich, fertile time. ” In a few years, she's hoping the campaign will help improve the percentage of children prepared to succeed in kindergarten. According to a 2015 study of kindergarten readiness in the Oakland Unified School District, just 43 percent of Oakland students were “fully ready” for school, meaning they were able to identify shapes and colors, and to regulate their emotions and exhibit  . There is clearly work to do. There's also room to grow when it comes to prompting adults and the children they care for to actually use the panels. During that 10 a. m. visit to the park, the playground was deserted. On a return trip around 3 p. m. just after school let out for the day, a few families cut through the park, but only two stopped to play. One woman with three young children sat on a bench and ate a snack while her children clambered up the structure, ignoring the panels. Another, who did not want to give her name, observed her two young girls as they played on a different structure a few yards away that does not have the talking prompts. Do they ever play on the other one? No, she said, not usually, because it's smaller and doesn't have swings. What does she think of the panels with writing? A lot of kids who play here can't read yet, she said, so they don't really make sense. What does she think about the idea that they're actually aimed at adults and not so much at the kids? It's interesting, she said, but she usually sits on the bench. Keener isn't surprised by those reactions or too discouraged by them either. The panels have only been in place a few months, she pointed out, and “behavior change takes time. ” And the panels at the park aren't going to magically end the word gap, but they're part of a broad effort to reach children and families where they are. Too Small to Fail is working with the local children's hospital, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland, too, and families might also see subtle messaging at bus stops, on billboards, and in local   facilities where kids spend idle time. The idea, Keener said, is to normalize positive   interactions. It's also, she added, an important way to symbolically say to the neighborhood, “we don't give up on any community. ” Susan Greenwald, the director of community partnership programs at the hospital, which has worked on the campaign, compared the overall initiative to major   efforts like the “back to sleep” campaign to end sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or smoking cessation. “It's like raising consciousness,” she said, with a simple, straightforward message: talk, read, and sing with your baby."

59934,82017,"November: A Good, but Not Perfect, Jobs Report",Atlantic,Bourree Lam,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"After a year of solid —  if at times uneven —  job growth, 2016 looks like it will close on an economic high note. On Friday morning, the Labor Department reported that the the unemployment rate dropped to 4. 6 percent —  the lowest since before the recession. The U. S. economy added 178, 000 jobs in November, meeting the expectations of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal who anticipated that 180, 000 jobs added. The numbers are once again indicative of steady economic growth, but there's less positive news mixed into the report as well: While the number of jobs added and the unemployment rate bode well for the state of the economy, economists have been looking for wage growth and an increase in   participation this year, both of which would have indicated that the labor market is not just growing, but strengthening. A tightening labor market would produce better pay for American workers and allow those who dropped out of the workforce during the recession to return to work. In November, both of those numbers were down. For wages, some improvement has happened: In recent months, average hourly earnings reached a high of $25. 92, compared with  $24. 76 in January of this year. October's wage growth, at 2. 8 percent, was the strongest reading since the recession. But in November, average hourly earnings disappointingly fell 3 cents, to $25. 89, following a   increase in October and an   increase in September. This slowdown, which was somewhat expected, brings the overall wage growth in the past 12 months to 2. 5 percent. But that rate has been fairly constant throughout 2016, which is a positive sign.   participation ticked down slightly to 62. 7 percent, near a   low. The root cause of declining participation remains disputed, but there are several reasons why this number may not have improved as economists hoped. The first is related to demographics: Older Baby Boomers are dropping out of the workforce by retiring. Another more dreaded factor is that the number of discouraged workers —  Americans who've lost jobs but aren't returning to the labor market to look for work —  climbed back up to 591, 000 in November, after hitting a low in October. Yet another piece of this economic mystery is related to questions about gender and work: Economists still don't have a good handle on why   men aren't looking for work, and whether rising childcare costs is the reason women are dropping out of the labor market. Next year,   participation figures will remain a major focus, as economists hope that the economy can at least stem —  if not reverse —  the decline. This jobs report is the last before the Federal Reserve's final meeting of the year. The U. S. central bank has yet to raise interest rates in 2016, most likely due to the lack of inflation throughout the year, but the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been hinting at a December rate hike for the past few months. While the Fed left interest rates unchanged at its November meeting, the recently released minutes from that meeting indicated that most FOMC members thought “it could well become appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate relatively soon” as long as U. S. economic indicators continue to hold the current course. Many analysts believe that a solid jobs report, such as this one, ensures a rate hike before the year's out. Overall, 2016 has been a good year for the U. S. labor market. The American economy has been adding jobs for 74 consecutive months, and there's evidence that it can continue to gain strength in 2017.

In the same month, the EPA and the United National Highway Traffic Safety Administration enacted a rule that limits the carbon dioxide emissions from   vehicles like trucks and tractors. In a few months, these regulations could vanish, along with over 100 others designed to protect the health, safety, and welfare of Americans. To an extent, regulations are necessary. Laws like the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Occupational Safety and Health Act, and many others have been instrumental in improving health, saving lives, and protecting the environment. These rules are multiplying. Their opponents argue that they limit businesses, stifle innovation, add red tape, and cost jobs. Their defenders say that they boost efficiency, create employment in new sectors, and are moral imperatives regardless of costs. It is clear where   Trump stands. “The monstrosity that is the Federal Government with its pages and pages of rules and regulations has been a disaster for the American economy and job growth,” he said during his campaign. Come January, he will have the power to take on that perceived monster. As has been widely reported, a Trump administration can easily repeal regulations that were enacted by federal agencies in the final months of the Obama administration. But with the help of a few key new bills that are currently making their way through Congress, he could also thwart the very infrastructure of   policy making, transforming it from a process that's merely frustrating into one that's also futile. In 1996, under the guidance of Newt Gingrich, Congress passed the Congressional Review Act (CRA). It allows them to issue a “resolution of disapproval” that repeals rules issued by independent agencies like the EPA or FDA, or even by the Executive Branch. And it makes the process very fast, immunizing it against delaying tactics like filibusters. It sounds powerful, but there are two catches. First, the rules must have been enacted within the last 60 session days of the Senate. Second, the resolution must pass both houses of Congress and be signed by the President. And since no President would willingly negate their own regulations, the CRA is typically an impotent device. It only becomes powerful under a very particular set of circumstances —  when an incoming President wants to negate their predecessor's recent works, and when their party controls both houses of Congress. That's what happened in March 2001, when George W. Bush repealed a Clinton regulation that protected workers from ergonomic injuries —  the only time in history when the CRA has been successfully used. And it's what might happen when Trump gets inaugurated in January. He'll walk into the Oval Office with a   House and Senate behind him, allowing him to shoot down any significant regulation that Obama passed after  . The list includes the FDA's ban on chemicals in antibacterial soaps. It includes EPA rules on methane and ozone emissions, formaldehyde levels in wood products, and efficiency standards for heavy vehicles. It includes rules on drilling for Arctic oil, managing wastewater from fracking, and protecting elephants from poaching. “There'll be strong incentive for the Republicans to go after as many regulations as they can,” says Amit Narang, a regulatory policy advocate at Public Citizen. They could also do so en masse. On November 17, the House of Representatives passed the Midnight Rules Relief Act —  an amendment to the CRA, which allows Congress to disapprove of many regulations in one fell swoop. (The amendment is still awaiting Senate approal.) Even without the amendment, the consequences of the existing CRA could be severe. Once a rule is repealed, the CRA stops agencies from issuing another that's “substantially the same,” unless they're specifically authorized to do so by Congress. “The CRA is like a nuclear bomb,” says Narang. “It not only kills a regulation but leaves a radioactive legacy. ” The CRA kills regulations in the past. Other bills could stop the regulations of the future from ever becoming law at all. The most prominent of these, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act, is something of a spiritual opposite to the CRA. If it passes, it would mean that any major regulation —  those with economic costs of more than $100 million —  must be approved by both chambers of Congress within a   window. Its proponents have billed it as a way for Congress to claw back some of the   authority that they say the President has wielded too freely. But critics say that the Act would allow Congress to block important legislation by simply doing nothing. “It would slow progress on all fronts, but on environmental policy, where there is such unified Republican antipathy, it would almost certainly result in a total freeze,” write David Roberts and Brad Plumer at Vox. As it is, making regulations isn't easy. Agencies have to recruit scientific experts, do research, compile evidence, go through peer review, face pushbacks from industry, and give the public many chances to comment. At any time, they could be sued or challenged in court. The REINS Act would allow Congress to discard all that empiricism for what amounts to a downvote. “It substitutes a political judgement for all the analysis and public process,” says Rosenberg. “You'd just have a popularity contest. ” Wendy Wagner, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin adds that the Act would encourage industry lobbyists to circumvent the regulatory process by directly targeting members of Congress. “It lets the richest parties know that they have yet another bite at the apple,” she says. That may not be a bad thing, says Susan Dudley, director of the George Washington Regulatory Studies Center. “If people don't like the decisions, they can vote out the guys who voted for it out,” she says. “Right now, Congress has the best of both worlds. They can pass sweeping legislation but then delegate the details to regulatory agencies. If their constituents don't like it, they can stomp their feet and say regulatory agencies have gone rogue. The REINS Act might make our elected representatives more accountable. ” “That's a great idea if it were 1789,” counters Wagner. “Now, the rules are often 100 pages long. To imagine that all members of Congress have the time or energy to fully read or understand them is simply not credible. ” Even if Congress were to seriously consider every rule on the cards, that would equate to almost a day of extra floor time per week —  an unmanageable workload at a time of historically low productivity.   That said, there's no guarantee that REINS will happen. Its most recent incarnation, proposed in January 2015, passed in the House and now awaits Senate approval. All past iterations have died at that point, even at times when the Republicans controlled the Senate with a greater majority than they'll enjoy in 2017. (“[The] proposal must be seen as an exercise in political theater,” wrote Ronald Levin from the Washington School of Law, just last year.) But the REINS Act will find a champion in Trump. Even though signing it represents a surrender of executive power, he has already promised to do so, and to “work hard to get it passed. ” REINS is far from the only threat to    . There are others, all bearing respectable titles, and all cloaked in principles that scientists themselves fight for. Take the Secret Science Reform Act, which was passed by the House in February 2015, and was sponsored by Lamar Smith who chairs the Committee on Science, Space and Technology. It would stop the EPA from developing rules unless all the information they used was “publicly available online in a manner that is sufficient for independent analysis and substantial reproduction of research results. ” That sounds great! For years, scientists have been trumpeting the value of free publications, of openness in methods and results, and of efforts to improve reproducibility. But the Act's focus on reproducibility could be used to ignore   epidemiological studies that are impractical to duplicate, or on   events like oil spills. The call for openness is also problematic. When the EPA creates public health regulations, for examples, it often relies on studies that use medical records, which are confidential and cannot be legally released. “It's a ” says Michael Halpern, deputy director of the Center for Science and Democracy. “You have to release all the data before you put the rule forward, but you can't release all the data. ” The cumulative effect of these acts would be to “gut the scientific foundation of many of our landmark health and public safety laws, like the Clean Air Act,” says Halpern. “They're not going after the laws directly but going after how the government can use science to fulfill those laws. ” If all this happens, it will be more than just a war on regulation. It will be a war on expertise itself, on the role of science in informing American society. That society, incidentally, is generally supportive of regulations. Both Democrat and Republican voters say that the government should play a major role in ensuring safe food and medicine, protecting the environment, and setting workplace standards. Two in three people support the Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon emissions, and three in five say that stricter environmental protections are worth the economic costs. Trump clearly disagrees. He has appointed committed deregulators to key positions climate skeptic Myron Ebell, for example, is leading the transition team for the EPA. And in a YouTube video, released 21st November, he said that upon entering the Oval Office, he “will formulate a rule that says that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. ” “So important,” he added. Other countries have related systems, but with important differences. The UK runs a misleadingly named “one in, three out” rule, where the costs of any new regulation must be offset by changing existing ones to save three times that amount. But the National Audit Office concluded that in enshrining that rule, the government hadn't properly assessed either the costs of existing regulations or the benefits of deregulation. Meanwhile, Canada has a    policy, but one that explicitly excludes any protections to health, safety, or the environment. There is no sign that Trump will push for such exceptions. His blanket approach “doesn't make sense,” says Narang. “The decisions won't be made on science, but on whether you can find two rules to get rid of. ” Dudley argues that the policy might encourage   to review existing regulations more frequently. “The scientific method is that you have a hypothesis, test it, and then revise it based on data,” she says. “But we never go back and test regulations. The incentives aren't there for evaluation, so that could be an advantage of    . ” Still, she argues that the policy may be unworkable, since removing a regulation typically takes as much time as creating a new one. Indeed, creating regulations is already a tortuously slow process. After the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded in April 2010 —  an obvious and   disaster —  it took five years to improve safety requirements for the blowout preventers that are meant to avert such explosions. Under REINS and similar bills, that span of time would be even longer —  perhaps infinitely so. “I wouldn't say regulations are perfect but we want them to be based in science, and to come from really strong evidence,” says Andrew Rosenberg, Director of the Center for Science and Democracy. “There may be a wholesale turning away from that science to this narrative of ‘regulations are bad. '”"
59936,82019,"The Dark Omen of Those Dow 19,000 Hats",Atlantic,Adrienne LaFrance,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"So Trump was elected and the financial world didn't fall apart. Not yet anyway. In fact, the markets are soaring. The SP 500 and Nasdaq have hit record highs in the weeks since the presidential election. The Dow Industrial Average closed above 19, 000 for the first time ever last week —  a milestone that some traders helpfully broadcast via novelty headwear. Dow baseball caps are a tradition at the NY Stock Exchange —  one that goes back nearly two decades. Some may still wear them in earnest, but I find they're best appreciated as a wearable form of gallows humor. Back in March 1999, as the Dow approached the 10, 000 mark for the first time, NY Stock Exchange officials ordered thousands of dark blue baseball caps with “Dow 10, 000” stitched across the front. It was an auspicious moment for the U. S. economy —  and one that seemed to match the broader cultural buoyancy at the dawning of a new millennium. Even outside of financial circles, Americans were captivated by the Dow as it approached the   mark. “It is the millennial feeling of Dow 10, 000 —  rather than any intrinsic interest in stocks or even money —  that has caught the attention of some NYers,” The NY Times reported in 1999. That “millennial feeling” was one of enormous optimism about the future. The USA was in year 17 of a bull market, the best economy in a generation. There was a sense that investing had been democratized —  by a gangbusters market that made it seem easy for anyone to rake in money, but also by the fledgling internet (and   online platforms like  ) that made trading possible for the every person (at least in theory) without the help of a fancy broker. It had taken just four years for the Dow to rocket from 4, 000 to 10, 000, and the SP 500's annual return during that time was a stupefying 28 percent. (That's quite high. Typically, the annual return hovers around 10 percent, on average.) The people who could afford to invest anything in the first place were giddy with the promise of ongoing prosperity, a trajectory that “Dow 10, 000” came to represent. (Approaching the milestone was not without its jittery moments: On three occasions in March 1999 the Dow crossed the 10, 000 threshold during trading but fell back down below the marker before the closing bell. At one point, the blue caps were “hauled onto the trading floor. .. only to be dragged off again when final calculations showed that the index was three points under the magic number,” the Times wrote in 1999.) Finally, on March 29, 1999, it happened. The Dow closed above 10, 000. And when it did, Rudy Giuliani, who was then the mayor of NY City, and Richard Grasso, the NYSE chairman at the time, tossed armfuls of the specially made baseball caps to jubilant traders cheering on the floor. “They rained them down on everybody,” Bernie McSherry, a longtime market watcher who was on the floor at the time told The Wall Street Journal a decade later. “That 10, 000 number was just something that was beyond the imagination for a long time. ” And then, it wasn't. Just five weeks later, the Dow toppled 11, 000. A headline in the Times practically shrugged at the news: “Another Record For the Dow. (Ho Hum). ” There's nothing magic about the Dow hitting 10, 000 —  or 11, 000, or 15, 000, or 19, 000 for that matter. The number is just a calculation based on the sum of stocks from 30 major companies like   General Electric, Johnson  Johnson, Nike, and Walt Disney. Yet reaching Dow milestones has long held a psychological significance among traders. Looking back, 10, 000 still stands out as a particularly meaningful turning point. “The Dow at 10, 000 is not only a testament to the profound economic change that has swept the U. S. over the last two decades,” The Los Angeles Times wrote in 1999, “but also a reflection of how many millions of Americans pinned their financial hopes to the stock market. ” “Ten thousand is kind of scary,” J. P. Sipp, a lawyer from Staten Island, told The NY Times in 1999. “I have a feeling that things can't stay this prosperous much longer. ” He was right. First, the dotcom bubble burst. Then, the housing market crashed. (And between those two economic catastrophes,   happened.) Over a period of about eight years —  from March 2000 to September 2008 —  that “millennial feeling” of American optimism didn't just fade, it evaporated. Traders didn't ditch the baseball hats entirely, but they did modify them to match the dark mood of a new economic and cultural reality. I like the approach favored by the trader Mark Feeley, who transformed his “Dow 10, 000” cap into a “Dow 8, 000” cap in 2002: It took more than seven years for the Dow record to creep up from 11, 000 to 12, 000, a milestone reached in 2006. The Dow first crossed the 14, 000 mark in 2007. After that, it cratered to near 6, 000 in 2009. With fits and starts, the market bounced back. In 2013, when the Dow crossed the 15, 000 mark, the celebratory hats returned. Some may still wear them in earnest, but I find they're best appreciated as a wearable form of gallows humor. In 2016, Dow milestone hats are a throwback to a simpler time, and a reminder that the Dow —  even at new heights —  isn't what it used to be, as plenty of market trackers will argue. In postwar America, when “everyone's income tended to move in the same direction,” as the economics reporter Adam Davidson  wrote in a 2012 essay, the Dow was a solid indicator of the nation's economic health. But even by the time the Dow was teetering toward the 10, 000 mark in the late 1990s, it was mostly a game in which a few investors could make fortunes. The     market peaks of the 1990s “hid a historic fracturing,” Davidson wrote. “One lucky group, enriched in part by the instant wealth of the bubble, saw its income grow faster than ever while the middle and lower classes' share of national income was declining. ” Within two decades' time, those same dynamics would result in a hat of their own: an    red cap emblazoned with yet another dream of prosperity, one that promises to make America great again."
59937,82020,François Hollande's Legacy,Atlantic,Yasmeen Serhan,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"When President François Hollande announced Thursday that he would not be seeking reelection in next year's presidential contest, he began first by outlining all the ways in which France has progressed since he took office in May 2012. It's for his successes —   from reducing unemployment to legalizing   marriage —   that the    Socialist president would likely want to be remembered. But such achievements won't define his presidency, at least not alone. While he could be remembered as one of only two Socialist politicians to ever be elected to the French presidency (the other was François Mitterrand) he could also go down in history as being the least popular French president since World War II, hobbled by a 4 percent approval rating, campaign pledges that weren't delivered, and a stream of deadly terrorist attacks that hit France seemingly at will over two years. Dr. David Lees, a researcher on French politics at Warwick University in the U. K. told me that while it's often expected that presidents lose popularity over the course of their term, the reason Hollande's satisfaction rating dropped so low could be because he didn't deliver the promises he made on the campaign trail. “Change, or le changement, was the explicit title of his campaign,” Lees said. “He was there to be real change in the Socialist way, to introduce meaningful,   reform. But he was also there to be real change from Nicolas Sarkozy and his ostentatious, extravagant lifestyle —  to be more of a “Monsieur Normal. ” In many ways, Hollande did bring change. Early in his term, he introduced a 75 percent tax on companies paying salaries of more than 1 million euros. As one of Hollande's flagship campaign promises, the passage of the “millionaire's tax” in December 2013 was a political victory for the Socialist government. And though it led to the   departure of Gérard Depardieu, the French actor who in opting to avoid being taxed bid adieu to his French citizenship and moved to Belgium (he has since become Russian) the majority of French people favored the reform. Socially, Hollande achieved another major campaign promise when in May 2013 his government approved a law allowing   couples to marry and adopt children, putting France well ahead of many other Western countries. “It seemed as though he were trying to help ordinary people,” Lees said of Hollande's early years. Not all of Hollande's reforms were received as warmly. In his effort to address the effects of the 2008 financial crisis, Hollande oversaw the passage of two highly unpopular economic reforms. The first, dubbed the “Macron Law” after its chief architect Emmanuel Macron, the former economy minister and current independent presidential candidate, was passed in July 2015 in an effort to boost economic growth, and included measures permitting businesses to open some Sundays of the year, as well as allow companies and workers to negotiate more flexible pay and working hours. The second round of reforms, which were imposed by decree in July, aimed to make it easier for businesses to employ people and gave employers more leeway to negotiate hours, wages, and time off —  reforms that were met with widespread protests. “He failed to put more money in the pockets of ordinary people, and that's really what you expect from a Socialist president,” Lees said. But perhaps the most memorable aspects of Hollande's presidency will be not his policy decision, but the events that were seemingly out of his control. Several   terrorist attacks on French soil plunged the country into a state of emergency it has yet to emerge from. They began in January 2015 with the deadly attack on Charlie Hebdo, the French satirical magazine, and ended, most recently, with the attack on Bastille Day (July 14) in Nice. In between, there were stabbings, beheadings, and a   attack in Paris in November 2015 that killed 130 people. In all, more than 200 people were killed in all the attacks. “Every time he appeared to respond to the attacks, there was never any sense that the Socialist government really knew what he was doing,” Lees said. “There wasn't a clear plan of action —  a sense that we're going to look at the issue of integration, the issue of how Islam is taught in French schools, or how we can try and improve things with regard to making sure that immigrants from across the world feel welcome in France. It was in many ways the opposite. ” Indeed, it was his call following the Paris attacks to strip convicted terrorists holding dual citizenship of their French nationality that Hollande identified as his “sole regret” in his public address Thursday, a move he said thought would unite the people, but instead “divided us. ” Even Hollande's promise of appearing as being “Monsieur Normal” faded following numerous revelations into his personal life. In January 2014, the president was revealed to be having an affair with Julie Gayet, the French actress, after Closer magazine published photos of the French president waiting outside the actress's apartment on a scooter, donning a motorcycle helmet. Though his approval rating paradoxically rose by two points after the allegations were made, only to plummet again thereafter, the tryst lumped him in with past presidents like Sarkozy and Mitterand, both of whom had    . Ultimately, Hollande's decision to remove himself from contention for the Socialist nomination could help save the Socialist party, which some polls projected could come in at a disqualifying fourth place behind Macron in the first round of next year's presidential contest. Hollande stepping down opens the door for his prime minister, Manuel Valls, to run to succeed him at the head of the Socialist ticket, but whether or not he stepped down soon enough for Valls to run in next month's primary is unclear. Should Valls decide to run, he'll have to declare his candidacy before December 15. Regardless of how next year's election plays, Lees said Hollande will likely be remembered for le changement that never came. “He could have been brilliant,”” Lees said. “He could have been really, really good. ”"
59938,82021,Reading Literature Won't Give You Superpowers ,Atlantic,Joseph Frankel ,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"“Reading,” according to the writer Joyce Carol Oates, “is the sole means by which we slip, involuntarily, often helplessly, into another's skin. ” The idea that literature orients readers to the thoughts and feelings of others goes back at least as far as Aristotle, but only recently have psychologists tried testing it in the lab. In 2013, a widely publicized study in the journal Science by David Kidd and Emmanuele Castano of the New School suggested that reading “literary” short stories immediately improved participants' abilities to read the facial expressions, and thus the emotional states, of other people. Several media outlets (The Atlantic included) ran with the idea, embellishing it with headlines like For Better Social Skills, Scientists Recommend a Little Chekhov. Now, a recent study   by Thalia Goldstein of Pace University in The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology calls those results into question. The original experiments called for participants to read one of six texts and then take the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) in which people are made to look at photographs of actors' eyes and select one of four states of mind the picture conveys. A raised brow could be a sign of panic, or a glaring eye a signal of anger. The number of correct answers is meant to measure theory of mind —  the ability to attribute “the full range of mental states” that motivate action. “It's a poor tool,” Rebecca Saxe, an MIT cognitive neuroscientist who studies theory of mind, said. But “it is the only measure that we currently have . .. which is why everybody uses it. ” And no matter what the RMET's weaknesses, both studies used it, and so the fact that they found different results is significant, Saxe said. Though Goldstein's group didn't replicate the more famous finding of the original study, they did find a common result: People who were lifelong readers of fiction (measured by the number of author names they could recognize) had significantly higher scores on the RMET. “But this is a correlation” —  not a causation! —  “and it falls under all the caveats that we need to put on a correlational finding,” Goldstein added. A lifetime of reading might make people better at imagining other people's thoughts and emotions, or those who are more in tune with other people's states of minds might be drawn to reading fiction in the first place. Or, a completely unrelated variable might explain the correlation. Along with raising objections from the authors of the original study, this newer paper is a reminder of the way reporting can reshape scientific ideas. Most popular coverage of the original study talked about this work in terms of  “empathy,” but the researchers themselves say that's not quite the same thing as theory of mind. “The terminology here is definitely a little mushy,” Goldstein told me. “People in the field would be the first to admit that. ” According to Goldstein, the finer distinction between theory of mind and ‘cognitive empathy' —  the capacity to imagine rather than share another person's feelings —  is another fuzzy point in the field.   When I spoke to Kidd and Castano, they told me that they believe Goldstein's group failed to weed out research subjects who spent too little time reading each story from their study. Because participants took an online survey through Amazon's Mechanical Turk, there is the risk that some simply clicked through the stories or kept the window open on their screen rather than sitting through the experiment, they said. (Goldstein declined to respond to a request for the   data of her group's participants). Still, several of the authors on Goldstein's study came from other labs that independently found the same negative finding, and weren't planning on publishing it until they found out Goldstein's group was submitting their study for publication. As a result, their group brings a much larger sample size to the table. This body of research runs into an   stumbling block that continues to dog those who study literature: What —  if anything —  makes a text “literary?” The “literary” stories in Kidd and Castano's experiment were cobbled together from the  . Henry Prize stories as well as finalists for the National Book Award. Goldstein's group used the same stories in their experiment (in order to replicate the original study) noting that the line between literary and popular fiction is “fuzzy and dynamic. ” “It's a hornet's nest, that question,” said Arnold Weinstein, a professor of comparative literature at Brown University. What gets to be called “literary” changes over time along with shifting ideas of social and political values, he said. Weinstein pointed to the controversy around Donna Tartt's novel The Goldfinch as an example. After it won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, many critics complained the book wasn't “serious” enough to merit the award. It's still an open question why psychologists, the media, and laypeople alike are so interested in the possible benefits of reading fiction. As Weinstein said, those both in and outside of the humanities have ascribed moral benefits to literature and art as “a rescue operation” for these disciplines at a time when their worth is under scrutiny. It's hard not to see arguments that literature might make people more empathetic, more moral, or more socially adept as a corrective to the perceived lack of “return on investment” when it comes to the arts. “I don't hope or believe that social psychology is needed to justify the humanities,” Kidd told me. But in a culture where science is sometimes treated with more gravity than the humanities, this research can be used to do exactly that. In a recent piece for The Atlantic, a high school English teacher leans on psychological studies of a similar strain to strengthen his argument that students are emotionally enriched by reading fiction. Even if literature fostered a stronger sense of theory of mind, or even empathy, Weinstein remains skeptical of what that would mean: “People used to comment that the people who ran the concentration camps probably knew Goethe and Schiller by heart,” he told me. While literature does produce “a kind of empathy,” he says, “the social uses and ramifications of that are extremely open to question. ” As the psychologist Paul Bloom writes, the benefits of empathy are sometimes seen as “too obvious for justification,” too easily conflated with the ideas of compassion, morality, and kindness. To Bloom, empathy is instead an emotional resource that has its right place and time —  whether it does any good or fills a need depends on the context. Among the many calls to empathy after the election, some have aptly pointed out that empathy (both by psychology's definition, along with the other values of the   that get attached to the word) is a   street. Calling on one side to empathize with the other, while probably not a bad thing, is just one example of the limits of relying on an overly idealized vision of what empathy can achieve.   There are many things literature can ‘do.' It can give voice to perspectives that are often silenced, offer refuge, and allow readers “try on” the lives of others. But this is slow work that depends so much on social circumstance. No reader, writer, or book exists in a vacuum. Trying to reduce the process of reading to a snapshot task leaves out some of this context. Perhaps to really understand what happens in the messy, intimate process of reading, looking at individual relationships between readers and stories may be more worthwhile than examining literature as a generalizable stimulus. While psychological research may someday offer another enriching perspective on reading fiction —  Goldstein mentioned the possibility of looking at how readers respond to texts over time —  these relationships may be too nuanced, or have too many variables, to be fully described by studies like this, let alone the popular coverage that recasts them."
59939,82022,How Gold Went From Godly to Gaudy,Atlantic,Kimberly Chrisman-Campbell,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"For a   populist hero, the optics were jarring. During his recent 60 Minutes interview, Trump perched on a   gilded Louis XV chair —  just one of the many   objects the   surrounds himself with, from his plane to his apocryphal toilet. Indeed, critics and designers alike have wondered if he will turn the White House into the Gold House —  a replica of one of his defunct casinos or his Trump Tower penthouse. Gold has always been the color of absolute power and those who aspire to it, as a sumptuous new exhibition at The Frick Collection illustrates. Pierre Gouthière: Virtuoso Gilder at the French Court (on view until February 19) has been in the works for five years, though the curator Charlotte Vignon told me that, as of the November 8 election, “the timing is right” to reexamine the aesthetics and politics of gold décor. As a symbol of wealth, power, and eternity, gold inspired centuries of bloody wars and dangerous mining endeavors. But in more recent history, its meaning has become more complex: Its association with dictators, celebrities, and artists has also transformed it into a sign of excess, corruption, and cultural domination. Because of its high cost and its unearthly beauty, gold has always had a strong association with royalty. In ancient Egypt, gold was reserved for deities and Pharaohs, who were considered to be gods among men. The biblical Book of Kings describes how “all the household articles in the palace” of King Solomon were pure gold. The “household” part is key: Any ruler can have a gold crown, but performing quotidian tasks such as eating, sleeping, sitting, and, especially, defecating on gold takes luxury to a whole new level. The modern history of gold décor begins with King Louis XIV, who revived the ancient practice of gilding, or applying a thin gold veneer to objects. In addition to beautifying, gilding protects against corrosion, and, in some cases, has even enabled objects to pass for solid gold. But unlike pure gold or delicate gilt plaster or wood, gilt metals —  particular bronzes —  are durable materials, making them suitable for objects that need to function as well as shine, like clocks. Gold and gilding were crucial to enhancing Louis's image as the   Sun King —  an Apollo bringing light to an unenlightened world. The King of Couture, Upon assuming absolute power in 1661, Louis began transforming a humble brick hunting lodge in the swamps of Versailles into the greatest palace in Europe. To fill its 700 rooms, he appointed a furniture czar, explaining that “there is nothing that indicates more clearly the magnificence of great princes than their superb palaces and their precious furniture. ” Versailles became a showplace for the French furniture industry's finest examples of gilded wood and bronze. Far from being cold and static, their gleaming surfaces danced in candlelight and firelight, maximizing available illumination with the help of with priceless   mirrors and   chandeliers, an effect that the art historian Mimi Hellman called “the aesthetics of the glint” in the book Paris: Life and Luxury in the 18th Century. It was a look so unique, so   that it granted the king a kind of material immortality. “You haven't seen anything if you haven't seen the pomp of Versailles,” the Vicomte de Chateaubriand remarked in his memoirs after a visit to the palace in the 1780s. “Louis XIV is still there. ” Commoners, too, sought to distinguish themselves in the eyes of posterity by collecting gilt bronzes, as the   journalist   Mercier wryly observed in his Tableau de Paris: “Every man may tell himself, during his lifetime: These bronzes and pictures which have cost me so much, and which I hide from curious eyes, will serve as evidence, after my death, for judgment of my tastes. ” If Louis XIV promoted the art of gilding, Pierre Gouthière perfected it in the   century. According to legend, his gilt bronzes imitated gold so perfectly that   herself was fooled. Scholars are still debating whether these   objects were intended to deceive, or considered prestigious in their own right. Vignon argued that what gilt bronze lacked in intrinsic value it made up for in skilled and costly labor. Sculpting models, which were then cast, chased, gilded, and polished, was a   and technically challenging process. “At that time, these objects were more than just trappings of power,” Vignon told me. “They were cutting edge, they were original, they were interesting —  like the latest Apple phone. ” In 1767, Gouthière was appointed gilder to King Louis XV. His work was so heavily in demand that he managed to extract commissions from both of the rival factions at court, united respectively around the king's mistress, Madame Du Barry, and his     . The Frick exhibition reunites a monogrammed gilt bronze window knob that Gouthière made for the Du Barry's Salon en    at Louveciennes with   Fragonard's series The Progress of Love, painted for the same room. But, as Vignon pointed out, “when the painter Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun wrote about her visit to Louveciennes 20 years later, it wasn't the paintings she remembered it was the chimneypieces and the gold locks on the doors. ” That is, objects crafted by Gouthière. When did gold become gaudy? The work of Gouthière and his contemporaries was considered modern and tasteful, not garish and   . “When you read the descriptions of Gouthière's mounts in catalogues of the time, they talked about taste and elegance,” Vignon told me, adding that these merchants were not just trying to justify Gouthière's high prices, but also celebrating his mastery of his craft. Louis XVI acquired several examples of Gouthière's work for the national art collection, in recognition of their lasting value. He could not have known that the rich culture of craftsmanship and patronage that produced them was about to disappear forever. Rather than going out of style, the taste for all that glitters became frozen in time with the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789. “[Gold] became a cliché, very soon after the Revolution,” Vignon said. “These objects became symbolic of a time of absolute power and an elitist society —  so much so that it ended in a bloody revolution. It makes sense that people looking for absolute power would continue to associate themselves with that kind of interior. ” Indeed, the gilded “Louis Style” became part of the decorative vocabulary of   imperialism and   despotism, as regimes of questionable legitimacy sought to bolster their cultural and political authority through elaborate visual propaganda. (In 2011, The Telegraph dubbed the look “Dictator Chic. ”) Saddam Hussein built dozens of grandiose palaces of marble, crystal, and gold leaf, which Vanity Fair cheekily compared to Trump's similarly decorated properties. People have been quick to point out that Muammar Gaddafi, too, shared Trump's taste in gilded chairs. But it's not just dictators and despots who adhere to the gold standard even the Elysée Palace, the official residence of the President of the French Republic, is filled with   gilded furniture today. “It seems to be a huge paradox about the representation of power,” said Vignon, who was born in Paris. “French power is still expressed in the language of ancien régime!” In popular culture, entertainers like Elvis “The King” Presley and Liberace, the “King of Bling,” used the power of gold to project an air of royalty, untouchable and otherworldly. Elvis's 141 gold records paled beside his     piano, his   Cadillac, and his $10, 000 gold lamé suit. Liberace, too, had a gold disco ball of a suit to match his glittery gold Bradley. And the artist Jeff Koons chose   gilded porcelain as the medium for his deliberately kitschy   statue of Michael Jackson, the “King of Pop,” and his chimp, Bubbles. Fittingly, the piece was displayed in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles in 2008. The    vibe of the 1980s —  when Trump Tower was built —  brought a fresh revival of the ornate   style, epitomized in fashion by designers like Christian Lacroix, John Galliano, and Vivienne Westwood and in interiors by Angelo Donghia, Trump's decorator. It's an aesthetic Trump has clung to in his homes and hotels, even as fashion has moved on to minimalism and industrialism and beyond. “I think Trump is using objects like that to express power, but without taste and refinement,” Vignon said. In the 18th century, she added, gold furnishings “were not only luxury objects. They were also an expression of   craftsmanship. When it is not new and it is only an expression of power, it's not interesting. ” Of course, tackiness is in the eye of the beholder one man's Versailles is another man's Graceland. But men (and women) who would be the Sun King should remember the cautionary tale of another king, the mythical Midas who greedily wished that everything he touched would turn to gold. Trump, for his part, is aware of the story: His father once bragged about his son that “everything he touches turns to gold,” and Trump has made that boast his brand, even titling one of his books The Midas Touch. Of course, the fictional King Midas came to realize that his golden gift was actually a curse. (Elvis came to a similar conclusion about his beloved gold Cadillac, putting it into storage because it was so impractical to drive.) In Ovid's version of the story, Midas begs the gods to take back his power, only to get saddled with a pair of ass's ears instead. In Aristotle's version, Midas dies of starvation. In Nathaniel Hawthorne's telling, Midas accidentally turns his beloved daughter into a gold statue. But it was Gouthière, the man with the Midas touch, who gave the legend its most chilling twist he once designed a vase with handles fashioned from the golden visage of Midas himself."
59940,82023,What Is the Future of the Office for Civil Rights?,Atlantic,Melinda D. Anderson,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"In the days after the presidential election, news outlets and  thousands of educators reported increases in harassment, bullying, and intimidation of students based on race, ethnicity, religion, and gender identity. While schools and colleges are on the frontline in confronting these incidents, one mechanism that for more than 35 years has served to curtail such actions is the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) within the U. S. Department of Education. The federal agency's mission is “to ensure equal access to education,” and it's charged with enforcing laws that prohibit discrimination against marginalized populations —  including students of color, religious and gender minorities, and students with disabilities. In recent years OCR has issued guidance to states and local school districts on their legal obligation to meet the educational needs of transgender students, students with ADHD, and youth in juvenile justice facilities the   unit also tracks how well public schools and districts nationwide measure up on equity in learning opportunities. As one president wraps up his term and another takes the reigns, some have speculated on what a Trump administration and Education   Betsy DeVos foretell for the   branch given indications that they plan to downsize the department. With many unknowns still in play, The Atlantic invited voices in education representing divergent viewpoints to offer their outlook and prognosis on the Education Department's   arm. The responses, via email, have been edited for clarity and length. Melinda D. Anderson: It would seem that the fundamental work of the current OCR —  whether focused on sexual harassment and violence, racial bullying, transgender discrimination, or other efforts —  is providing equitable learning environments. Could this work look different in the new administration and a   Department of Education? If so, how? Thomas J. Gentzel, the executive director of the National School Boards Association[Though] the fundamental work of OCR is enforcing   laws in education, it is the job of school districts to provide equitable learning environments and, ultimately, to balance all of the competing interests so that all students have safe environments in which to learn. NSBA has been concerned about executive overreach through the issuance of guidance [and] will continue to urge the incoming administration to exercise restraint in such an approach to achieving its educational objectives. Dan Losen, the director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at UCLA's Civil Rights ProjectA major question is to what extent a Trump [administration] will seek to unleash the forces of the far right and yield OCR [and the Department of Justice] as hammers for its agenda, versus dramatically diminishing the federal role in education by substantially cutting OCR's budget and reducing OCR's footprint. The latter entails allowing those [far right] forces to go unchecked at the state and local levels [where] they clearly have power and influence   …     [it's] like the difference between aggressive and passive aggressive, but [both] mean a big difference in the lives of children. I predict a lot more bullying, much less sensitivity, and blatant bigotry being tolerated [at schools and campuses. ]Robert Shibley, the executive director of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, an advocacy group focused on free speech in academia, and the author of Twisting Title IXThe fundamental work of OCR is to enforce the   laws over which it has been given jurisdiction by Congress, as well as duly enacted regulations based on those laws. I suspect that most of OCR's work will remain largely unchanged, but an agency's interpretation of laws and regulations is bound to change somewhat with a change of political control. Consensus won't be possible on every controversial issue, but OCR's efforts to fight discrimination are severely hobbled from the start if stakeholders don't even have the sense that they have been given a fair hearing, as they weren't with the April 4, 2011 [letter to colleges, universities, and schools] mandating that institutions use the preponderance of the evidence standard in   hearings. Harper Jean Tobin, the director of policy for the Washington, D. C.  National Center for Transgender EqualityOCR's mission will not change. How effective it is in carrying out that mission will depend in large part on the resources provided by Congress and the leadership provided by the president and his appointees. Unfortunately, the  's nominee for secretary of education and other members of his leadership team have shown an indifference or hostility to   enforcement in general, and hostility to certain communities in particular, including LGBT communities. Anderson: What do you predict as the biggest change —  either in approach or execution —  as the Department of Education's   arm transitions from the Obama era? Gentzel: Not much is known about the incoming administration's agenda for education   …     [however,] the nation's school boards will advocate for equity and excellence in public education, as well as oppose privatization schemes that drain public dollars from our public schools. Losen: Assuming DeVos and Senator Jeff Sessions [for attorney general] are confirmed, the biggest change will be that a Trump administration will ignore blatant   violations   …     seek changes that will add to segregated schools, and allow bullying of discrete and insular minority groups of children. From a   perspective, we can hope that what looks like a tidal wave peters out before it hits land, but we must prepare for the [impact]   …     This will be much, much worse than the prior Republican administrations who at least gave lip service to basic   issues. We will see a true crisis in U. S. civil rights and not just in education. Shibley: I don't have any special knowledge of how OCR's policies might change [but] I hope and recommend that the new OCR leadership withdraw the preponderance mandate, replace its unconstitutionally broad definition of sexual harassment with one that is in accord with Supreme Court case law, and recommit itself to going through proper notice and comment rulemaking procedures so that the interests of all concerned parties are actually taken into account. Tobin: That depends greatly on the direction taken by the Secretary of Education and other appointees, funding from Congress, and rulings from the courts. There could be both a tremendous   in   work in general and an abandonment of students' civil rights in certain areas, or even reversing course and advocating against students' civil rights in certain areas. Anderson: What is the overriding message the federal government should be sending to states, school districts, and schools regarding civil rights in educational programs and activities? Gentzel: The federal government should carry out its obligations to enforce federal civil rights in schools, and look to states and local school boards as partners in determining local solutions to address the [ultimate] needs of students. Losen: That enforcing civil rights is not a   game, but that we are all better off when our system of public education promotes equity in opportunity and justice for all. If the   applied to be a school superintendent, based on his words and his history of actions —  including refusing to rent apartments to black tenants, making racist statements about a sitting judge, operating a fraudulent school, and boasting of sexual assault —  no school board in America would hire him. Shibley: OCR's overriding message should be that unlawful discrimination will not be permitted in programs over which it has jurisdiction that OCR will continually work to ensure that it provides clear, legally sound guidance on how to obey those laws without unduly violating institutional freedoms and that institutions reasonably suspected of violating federal law should expect an uncompromisingly thorough, fair, and impartial investigation. Tobin: The federal government should provide educators with meaningful guidance on how to comply with the law in areas where educators have a lot of questions. It should reflect the best practices in education so that educators around the country can learn from them. It should be urging schools to do right by their students —  to protect their safety, their dignity, and their ability to fully participate in school —  and showing them how. It should stand consistently for the principle that every student matters and is equal in dignity, [with an equal] chance to learn. OCR has a very strong record in recent years of doing just that."
59941,82024," Ranked: After Castro, What the World's Eccentric Presidents Are Wearing",Atlantic,Matt Peterson,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Fidel Castro's passing brings to a close an important period in world history: the era of bold fashion choices by world leaders. From his cigars and uniforms to his    love of tracksuits, Castro knew how to project a brash image. But with Muammar Qaddafi departed, and Mao suits long since replaced by Western business wear, the geopolitical world has entered a period of sartorial blandness. Even Obama was willing to put on a silly shirt for the annual APEC summit. #MAGA hats notwithstanding, it's hard to imagine Trump following in his footsteps. For that matter, when have you seen Trump without a tie or a golf shirt? And yet, a few stalwarts are hanging on to their eccentricities. Here are some of the world leaders who remain committed to their affectations. 5. Salva Kiir. Where did George W. Bush leave his greatest mark on the world? In fashion, at least, the answer is South Sudan. The U. S. president reportedly gave a black Stetson to Kiir back in 2006, and the South Sudanese president has rarely been photographed without a cowboy hat on since. Ranked: World Leaders With the Best Nicknames, 4. Alexander Lukashenko. The man known as Europe's last dictator dresses as you would largely expect from a   apparatchik: sharkskin suits, greatcoats, military uniforms. But he has one favored accessory: his teenage son Kolya, who is rumored to be in line for succession. The two often appear in public in matching outfits. Suits? Yep. Military uniforms? You bet. Kolya has even been spotted with the true dictator's accessory: a golden gun. Maybe this one isn't so funny. 3. Robert Mugabe. Zimbabwe's    is a creature of the Castro era, and it shows. He has been known to show up to rallies with clothes displaying own face, a feat not even Trump has attempted yet. He has inspired his own fashion line in Zimbabwe. And he knows how to be an iconoclast: He stood out as the one leader not wearing the group outfit at an   summit last year. If you're going to rule forever, you might as well do it your own way. 2. Kim Jong Un. North Korea's dictator has so many visual tics it's hard to pick just one. There is his penchant for pinstripe suits, his fedoras, his desire that his countrymen share his hairstyle, or his brief flirtation with hipster glasses. South Korean media even speculated that he fractured his ankles wearing heels to make him look taller. But if there is one Kimism that has remained constant, it's the pants. For reasons as yet unexplained, he wears his trousers tailored long and wide, a choice most apparent when he's pictured sitting. Let's just be grateful he hasn't picked up any fashion tips from Dennis Rodman. 1. Nicolas Maduro. As his country disintegrates around him, Venezuela's president has attempted to drape himself in national symbols, literally. Channeling his popular predecessor, Hugo Chavez, Maduro frequently wears a jacket in the colors of the Venezuelan flag. He even tried to outflank his political opponents' fashion choices, accusing opposition leader Henrique Capriles of having stolen the   cap that became Capriles' trademark. Once, Maduro made a pilgrimage to Cuba for Castro's birthday. What did he bring for a gift? A track suit. Viva la revolucion!

Sasha survived the Nineties too. In December 1991, just months before he was born, the Soviet flag came down over the Kremlin and the Russian tricolor went up, ushering in the decade that hangs like a bad omen in the contemporary Russian psyche. The expectation that Russians would start living like their prosperous Western counterparts gave way to a painful reality: It would be a hard slog to turn a command economy into a market one, to make a democracy out of a society that had lived under absolute monarchy and totalitarianism for centuries. ” * * * Which Language Uses the Most Sounds? Click 5 Times for the AnswerBryant Rousseau | The NY Times“With five distinct kinds of clicks, multiple tones and strident vowels —  vocalized with a quick choking sound —  the Taa language, spoken by a few thousand people in Botswana and Namibia, is believed by most linguists to have the largest sound inventory of any tongue in the world. The exact count differs among scholars. Studies commonly cite more than 100 consonants, and some say there are as many as 164 consonants and 44 vowels. English, by comparison, has about 45 sounds at its disposal, total. ” * * * Inside the Country Where Rapping About the President Can Mean DeathMonica Mark | Buzzfeed“‘The situation in Gambia is crazy, especially if you come from an environment where you are free,' said Cham, wearing his usual baseball cap over his crown of spiky locs. ‘You can't even have a conversation and say the president's name out loud without somebody becoming scared. You have to use codes to say the president's name.' That president, Yahya Jammeh, has ruled with an iron fist for 22 years. Gambians go to the polls on Thursday, but for the first time, they will have a credible opposition to choose from. Gambia has had only two presidents since independence in 1965, so the election raises the possibility of a third one finally being voted in. And for thousands like Cham who've fled the regime, the results could decide whether they can finally return home. ” * * * First Brexit Then Trump. Is Italy Next for the West's Populist Wave?

Renzi, the telegenic, youthful leader of the   Democratic party (PD) has placed his authority behind proposals to limit the powers of the senate, Italy's second chamber. His plan involves cutting the number of senators from 315 to 100, all of whom would be appointed —  rather than elected, as at present —  and restricting their power to influence legislation. ” * * * North Korean Volcano Provides Rare Chance for Scientific CollaborationRae Ellen Bichell | NPR“In 2011, when North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il died, the state news agency reported that Mount Paektu took on a supernatural glow, and that at its summit, Heaven Lake shook with cracking ice. Those reports were pretty unscientific. But several years earlier, between 2002 and 2005, Mount Paektu had experienced a swarm of little earthquakes. That wasn't a good sign, because the   mountain straddling the border with China is not merely the subject of paintings and patriotic songs —  it's also a huge volcano. And little earthquakes can be a sign that, deep under the mountain, molten magma is starting to swirl. ” * * * How Fidel Castro Was at the Heart of Middle East PoliticsIshaan Tharoor | The Washington Post“Though he ruled a small island nation thousands of miles from North Africa, Castro was a titan of   geopolitics and an inspirational figure for many societies emerging from the yoke of European colonialism. Not long after his armed revolution won power in Cuba in 1959, Castro's envoys met with Algerian rebels locked in a bitter liberation war against France. In the years prior, Cuban intellectuals chafing under a   dictatorship had looked on with admiration at the Algerian struggle. The respect was mutual: While in a French prison, Ahmed Ben Bella, the socialist who later became Algeria's first president, claimed he followed reports of the unlikely victories of Castro's guerrillas. ”"
59943,82026,How the Economics of Journalism Explains 2016's Information Bubbles,Atlantic,Joe Pinsker,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Despite frequent criticism from the   and despite drawing historically low levels of trust from the public, the media —  or at least parts of it —  actually did quite well in serving the public good during the   to this year's election. That's the view of Jay Hamilton, a professor of communication at Stanford and the director of the school's journalism program, who says that throughout the campaign, enterprising national reporters (particularly those at The NY Times and The Washington Post) were consistently turning out stories with new information that was relevant to voters. But Hamilton, whose recent book Democracy's Detectives is about the market for investigative journalism, is not as sanguine about the performance of much of the media industry in the past year. As reporting at large national publications has gotten ever more   —  and as these publications have amassed an increasing share of reporting awards as a result —  jobs at regional outlets that aren't based in prosperous coastal cities have been drying up, limiting those papers' ability to scrutinize local politicians and organizations. (Hamilton also counts Facebook among “the category of media institutions that failed us” for its lack of response to the viral circulation of blatantly inaccurate articles during the campaign.) An economist by training, Hamilton thinks about these developments in part as a product of the way that many media organizations make money online. I talked to him recently about the incentives that news outlets have for digging up new (and true) information, and how those incentives have changed in the past century and a half. The interview that follows has been edited and condensed for the sake of clarity. Joe Pinsker: Given what you know about the history of the media industry, do you think that Trump could have gotten elected with the media infrastructure of 10 years ago? 50 years ago? Jay Hamilton: That's an interesting question, because if we went back 50 years ago, the   question was, ”Why is the media so conservative?” Newspapers were predominantly endorsing Republican candidates. I think it would have been interesting with them as gatekeepers —  there are so many things that Trump has said that wouldn't make it into the newspapers because of language. As for 10 years ago or 15 years ago, I talked with Marty Kaiser, who's the former editor of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, about this year's election coverage. He said if you look at the newspapers in the Midwest, 15 years ago they would have had the resources to do many more “What are the voters thinking?” stories. They would have fanned out across the state and talked to people. In Wisconsin, there are 72 counties, so they would have talked to the Democratic county chairman and the Republican county chairman, and they would have perhaps recognized the type of economic issues that may have been driving some of the decisions in those areas. We're in a world where, in the last 10 years, 40 percent of newspaper jobs have disappeared, and they have not disappeared evenly across the USA. Jim Tankersley has done great work that shows that media jobs are actually increasing in D. C. and L. A. but they're decreasing substantially in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and Minneapolis. If you go back to the 1990s, there were people like Barlett and Steele, who got two Pulitzer Prizes at The Philadelphia Inquirer for writing about D. C. issues from a Pennsylvania perspective. They did that series, “America: What Went Wrong,” linking up change in economic policy with what's going on on the factory floor. But all of that has disappeared. People at the metro dailies, the radius of what they write about has become much more restricted. I used to think of that as a local or state problem, but if we're keeping score through the electoral college, our failure to understand what was going on in Wisconsin or Michigan led people to be very surprised. Pinsker: One argument that I have heard is that national news organizations “missed the story” on parts of the Trump coalition because their staffs are concentrated in the same large coastal cities. What do you make of that claim? Hamilton: I got my Ph. D. in economics from Harvard in the 1980s, and when we looked at international trade, we kept score with the Pareto principle, and we would say, “This is a good move for society if the pie gets bigger, if winners could compensate losers. ” But the key assumption there is, “if winners could compensate losers. ” When running that kind of   analysis, jobs are not a consideration, because you assume that people go to their   alternative use of their time. If you take that framework, that wouldn't be very helpful if you didn't also ask the question, “If you're 55 and out of work in West Virginia, what's the specific connection between the policies being proposed and your life?” I think it's not enough to drive through and say, “There are opioids here. ” It's a deeper thing about making that connection between policies and people's lives, and then understanding how people could use their vote as an expression of anger and frustration. Pinsker: In the attempts to arrive at that kind of understanding, what kinds of stories are likely to get told and which ones get ignored? Hamilton: I think there are five incentives that lead information to be created. “Pay me” —  that's the subscription model. “I want to sell your attention to somebody else” —  that's advertising. “I want to change how you think about the world” —  that's nonprofit. “I want your vote” —  that's partisan. And “I just want to talk” —  that's expression. All of those incentives are biased against telling the stories of   people. They're not subscribers, their attention is worth less to advertisers, they vote in lower numbers, and in some cases they're not linked up to broadband, so you're not hearing their voices on the internet. And they're definitely not donors to nonprofits. So there's a bias against telling stories from their perspective. Pinsker: I know that you're a fan of journalists' using computing to help them do their job. What opportunities do you think it offers for solving some of these problems you've mentioned with local reporting? Hamilton: There are two things that are possible that I like to look at. One is  : lowering the cost of discovering stories with better use of data and algorithms. One of the problems with local   stories is that you're not sure there's a story. If you go to a sports event, you know there's going to be a story. If you go to a   meeting, it's a jump ball —  you have no idea. I think that using algorithms to discover stories is a way to lower the cost. It's almost like electronic tip generation. Open Secrets, the data website, has something called the Anomaly Tracker. Their anomalies are things like, “Show me legislators who have sponsored a bill that is only being lobbied for by one company. ” Or, “Show me legislators who have 50 percent or more of their contributions coming from out of state. ” Derek Willis, when he was at The NY Times, used to have an alert any time there was a vote in Congress after midnight. As I used to tell my kids, nothing good happens after midnight. He had that programmed. On the demand side, to me, the dream would be a site that knows you so well that it can tell you a story in a personalized or engaging way. It knows what you've read, knows that you know the distinction between Sunni and Shia, knows that you like video and documents. If there were a site that knew you as well as Amazon, it'd allow for product differentiation not in terms of dialing up or down political bias like cable channels do but in terms of offering you what you're most interested in, in the dimensions that work for you. You might be more likely to engage with a story about public policy if a site could personalize the story by localizing the examples, building on your likely knowledge based on prior reading or watching, and giving you a graph instead of several anecdotes if you had demonstrated a facility with and interest in data. We're seeing glimmers of that, but to me, once you have that product differentiation, you can charge, and people would pay for it. Pinsker: Another thing that people have focused on after the election is how easy it is for people to surround themselves with information that supports their worldview. Can you give me a sense of how much of a departure from history this represents? Hamilton: In the 1850s and 1860s, we had a partisan press, and the words “Democrat” and “Republican” were in the names of the outlets. In the 1870s, you had the very expensive   presses invented, which could print thousands of papers per hour, and it became very important for publications to have a very large circulation, because you could spread the cost of that printing press across many people. At the same time, you started the evolution of national brands, thanks to railroads, and advertisers wanted to be able to deal with one large paper rather than four small ones in the city. So, starting in the 1870s and going through the 1900s, you had this evolution of objectivity as a commercial product. Papers became independent, they took “Democrat” and “Republican” out of the title, and it made business sense to try to speak about politics in a more nonpartisan way. If you move forward to the cable world or now especially the internet, you see a drop in fixed cost. Think about it in terms of the internet: It's very cheap to have a website, so you can now target a smaller niche, a more partisan niche. So, high fixed costs gave us objectivity and nonpartisanship low fixed costs now give us back a world of partisanship. You no longer need an expensive press and trucking system to reach the world. You also don't need a highly developed reputation built over time through a track record and expensive reporting to draw readers in. With the “fake news” generated in the 2016 election, individuals could make up stories, post them online, and see them circulate rapidly through the Facebook ecosystem. In the past, many advertisers would shy away from appearing next to demonstrably false content since it would undermine their brand with the broader public. For the fake stories that went viral on Facebook, it is hard to even know which advertisers appeared next to the false stories because the impressions are ephemeral and because the ads can be targeted so that individuals see different products depending on their demographics and past web use. Pinsker: Given that system of costs, what do you think would need to change in order to pop information bubbles, or at least enlarge them? Hamilton: That's one of the things that's interesting about  . If you look at somebody like Bill Adair at Duke, the creator of Politifact, his dream is to have a   database and if you have a smart TV, you could have an app so that when an ad comes on or when a program is being played and a statement comes up, it tells you, “That was true,” or “That's false. ” And we're seeing glimmers of that, with Google experimenting with a tag that appears next to stories in your search results that have been  . In a world where we're getting closer to   transcription and checking that against previous   I think it's going to be easier to see what's right and what's wrong. Pinsker: It's a cool idea to have a     bot superimposed on your TV, but wouldn't most people just turn it off if they had it? Isn't it more comfortable not to have that? Hamilton: It depends. I think that's a great empirical question, because if you have it on, you get to see the person that you detest —  you get to see their falsehoods as well as those of your candidate. I think that's an interesting race, about whose truth you want to know. But still, yes, there's always going to be this problem of the market for truth, which relates back to rational ignorance. If I believed my car ran on sand, I wouldn't be able to drive. But if I believed that Obama was born in Kenya, I might not pay a price. In fact, I might get   or even run for president. So that's always going to be there, that battle between our information demand as audience members and our information demand as voters. But I do think that computation holds some potential there. Pinsker: In terms of the industry's current economics and resources, what do you think the media is particularly   for in covering Trump's presidency, and what do you think it's particularly poorly suited for? Hamilton: I think it's   for covering the watchdog function of how policy is made and what the backgrounds are of the people who are coming in, because that's something they've done before. And then, after missing the local story in the Rust Belt states, I think hopefully people will learn from that. I think that hopefully they won't only go back four years from now. It would be very interesting to check back in and see how the lives are changing or not with the folks who are essential to his election. "
59944,82027,Where Clinton Fell Short,Atlantic,Andrew McGill,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"It now seems likely that Clinton will get fewer votes than Obama did in 2012. More distressingly for Democrats, she fared worse in   cities that anchor swing states, including Detroit, Cleveland, and Milwaukee. To critics on the left, that's evidence of a campaign that dragged its feet, and a candidate who took her base for granted. Her defeat, in their minds, was an unforced error. How Trump Could Wage a War on Scientific Expertise, But the numbers show something different. There's no question Clinton faltered in some Democratic cities, but the gaps between her haul and Obama's in those locations were modest. The vast majority of her deficit came instead from counties that Obama lost in 2012: They didn't like him, but they really hated her. As of Thursday, ballot counts collected by the Atlas of U. S. Presidential Elections show Clinton received fewer votes than Obama did in 87 percent of U. S. counties. That sounds worse than it really is. Some of those counties are pretty small, and the remaining 11 percent include a few megacities, such as Los Angeles and Chicago. Let's put it another way: Accounting for population density, she scored worse than Obama in areas that are home to roughly half the people who voted this year, and scored the same or better than Obama with the other half. Where did she fare the worst? Line them up, and it doesn't look good —  they're a bevy of heavily Democratic counties. With the exception of Macomb and Suffolk, Clinton still won all these counties. She just didn't win them as decisively as Obama did. That hurt her: Counties, unlike most states, are not    and every vote counts toward the statewide total that determines who wins the electors. Clinton needed to run up the score in Democratic centers as high as she could to counter Trump's overwhelming lead among rural voters. When she went to the liberal well, they didn't give her the votes. But they didn't cost her the election, either. Among the 2, 700 counties where Clinton got fewer votes than Obama did in 2012, she still held her own in most of the places her predecessor won, winning many of them and picking up 90 percent of his votes in the process. All told, she ended up with a 1. 8 million vote deficit compared with Obama in these communities. That seems like a lot. But that wasn't her big problem. It's in the regions Obama lost that Clinton felt the most pain. In red counties, she received only 84 percent of the president's votes in 2012, finishing 2. 1 million behind. Even if Clinton matched Obama in turnout for every county he won that year, that wouldn't erase her deep disadvantage in conservative areas that the president himself couldn't clinch. Granted, things get a bit tricky in the swing states. In Wisconsin, Ohio, and Michigan, if Clinton had matched 2012's turnout in   counties, she might have been able to pull out victories. But these states didn't necessarily see Democrats stay home on Election Day. Rather, it seems likely that many Obama voters flipped to Trump. And Clinton's critics miss an important point: She actually performed better than Obama did in nearly 400 counties. Some of these places are quite hefty,  . Here's where she exceeded her predecessor the most: Clinton killed it in California (which still has 600, 000 ballots left to count, many of which will probably go Democratic, given the state's blue status). And she performed very well, compared with Obama, in many of the country's major population centers. If you factor in these successes, Clinton's net turnout actually tops Obama's in the areas that went Democratic four years ago. In the end, she beat Obama's take by 120, 000 among those counties, with gains in the coasts canceling her   losses in the Rust Belt. That's not a weak showing. “Democrats did better this time in places that were already blue  and did worse in places that were already red,” said Barry Burden, a   professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. “It sort of is a battle of the many versus the few. You add up those smaller rural places, and they were enough to swamp the bigger urban areas, and even suburban counties. ” Unfortunately for Democrats, Clinton won in all the wrong places. Her strong showing in diverse, dense counties will have a place in history. But because of the Electoral College, her surpluses in California didn't help her compensate for deficiencies in Michigan. And because she was so deeply unpopular in conservative communities, her net turnout will still fall below Obama's. There's also the insurgent popularity of Trump himself, who gained 1. 5 million voters over Romney. Some of them were Democrats. So Clinton won the popular vote, but she lost the election she didn't top her predecessor's total, despite heavy turnout from places that liked him the most. Democrats will have to figure out how to capitalize on her successes —  while at the same time avoiding her defeats —  come 2020."
59945,82028,Will the Far-Right Triumph in Austria?,Atlantic,Krishnadev Calamur,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Austrians will vote Sunday in an election that could propel the far right to the country's highest office for the first time since World War II. The vote is a rerun of an election in May that was won by the tiniest of margins by Alexander Van der Bellen, the    independent candidate backed by the Green Party, who defeated Norbert Hofer, the    presidential candidate of the   Freedom Party. Hofer had been favored to win, but Van der Bellen triumphed by 31, 026 votes, or 0. 6 percentage points. His victory was attributed to the 750, 000 postal votes that were cast in the election. Two weeks later, the Freedom Party, citing a “massive number of irregularities and mistakes,” said it would appeal the result. It alleged that postal ballots in 94 out of Austria's 117 districts were opened before rules permitted their unsealing, and that they were counted by people who weren't authorized to do so. In July, Austria's Constitutional Court upheld that appeal and annulled the result. The court found that though rules had been broken in a way that could have influenced the results, there was no proof the vote count was manipulated. The election was rescheduled for October 2, but the vote was postponed when it was discovered in September that the glue on the postal ballots wasn't sticking. A new date was fixed for the election: Sunday, December 4. Polls show a tight race this time around, too. Austria hasn't had a president since July 8, when Heinz Fischer stepped down. Although the post is largely ceremonial, it does serve some important purposes: It can influence the formation of a new government and even move to dismiss an existing government. That's where a Hofer victory can be pivotal. The Freedom Party is ahead in most polls for the parliamentary elections, which must be held before the end of 2018. If it wins, the   will have a hold on Austria's political system, upending the control that the   and   have had on the country since the end of World War II. But the consequences could stretch beyond Austria. The old European political order, founded on the ruins of war and based on open borders and free trade, is under threat from a       alliance stretching through the continent. Indeed, Hungary, which borders Austria, has its own   leader Netherlands may get its own, as well and there is a slim possibility next year that a   president emerges in France and a far slimmer one that a   chancellor emerges in Germany. Trump's election victory in the U. S. has also boosted the Freedom Party. Hofer told the The NY Times that Trump's victory has “loosened” the stigma in Austria against voting for his party, which was founded in the 1950s by former Nazis. Indeed, writing in the Times this week, Robert Misik, a journalist and author, noted that the Freedom Party is “a potential role model for the new European right. ” But, as Misik and the polls point out, Van der Bellen still has a chance. Last week he posted on Facebook an appeal from an    woman identified only as Gertrude. The woman, a resident of Vienna, said she was a Holocaust survivor, and compared the political tone in Austria to conditions faced by Jews under the Nazis.   “The thing that bothers me the most is the denigration of others, the attempt to bring out people's most base feelings instead of their decency,” she said. “I have seen this once before . .. and it hurts and scares me. ” The video has garnered more than 3. 2 million views, and has galvanized Austria's left. Another motivating factor for the left: Trump's victory in the U. S. Thousands of volunteers have turned out for Van der Bellen. But the retired professor of economics has his own detractors. He is seen as a divisive figure because of his views on a   Europe that should accommodated migrants, and because he quit the   Social Democrats and joined the Greens in the 1990s. Indeed, ahead of his victory in the May election, Van der Bellen, the child of a Russian father and an Estonian mother who had fled Stalin's purges, pleaded with voters: “I ask all those who don't like me but perhaps like Hofer even less to vote for me. ” Austrians will let the world know Sunday whom they dislike less."
59946,82029,Why Obamacare Might Not Die So Quickly,Atlantic,Russell Berman,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Updated on December 2 at 1:30 p. m.  Don't be so quick to kiss Obamacare goodbye. Yes, the election of Trump and Republican majorities in Congress will in all likelihood signal the death knell for the Affordable Care Act —  eventually. But as Republicans confront the complexity in policy and politics of replacing the law, they are leaning toward a strategy that would actually leave it on the books for as many as three more years. Conservatives in the House have been touting the plan since the first days after the election, and it was confirmed by Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the   Republican, in an interview with Politico. It goes like this: The House and Senate would repeal most, though not all, of Obamacare with simple majority votes in January as soon as Trump takes office, but they would set the date of enactment starting in 2019 or even 2020. The delay would allow for a   transition for the health insurance market, and it would buy time for Republicans to coalesce around a replacement package and —  they hope —  persuade at least eight Senate Democrats to cross party lines, break a filibuster, and pass it into law. This is a potentially perilous strategy for several reasons, each of which illustrate why overhauling an industry that comprises   of the American economy is an enormously difficult task. The Politics of Repeal Itself, The Affordable Care Act has been unpopular for most of its brief existence, but the idea of repealing it has always been even less popular. That continues to be the case even after the November election. A poll released Thursday by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that just    Americans support full repeal. Another 17 percent want the law scaled back, while a higher percentage want lawmakers to either make no changes or expand it. An often overlooked dynamic in health care polling is that a big part of the opposition to Obamacare has come from people who believe it did not go far enough to begin with. Those same people think repealing it entirely would make the system worse. Tom Price's Healthcare Agenda, So Republicans will be going against public opinion when they vote to scrap the law early next year. But they will do so anyway because their conservative base demands it, and because they will never be as unified as they are in the immediate, heady aftermath of their electoral victory. Still, there is no guarantee that Republicans will even have enough votes to repeal most of Obamacare without a replacement ready. The party's majority is comfortable in the House, but not the Senate. The Republicans is likely to have 52 Senate seats come January, assuming its nominee, John Neely Kennedy, wins a runoff election in   Louisiana later this month. A budget procedure known as reconciliation allows Republicans to repeal most of the law with a simple majority —  50 votes plus the vice president. Some consumer protections, including the ban on insurers discriminating based on   conditions, would likely have to stay in place. Can they pass it with such a slim margin? Probably, but there are already two question marks. One is Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the centrist Republican who voted against repeal in late 2015. The bill she opposed then is likely to be similar if not the exact same one that comes up in January. Asked on Thursday how she might vote if the measure came up again, Collins did not answer directly. Instead, she issued a   statement on the law that made no mention of repeal. “Under the incoming administration, Republicans and Democrats have a new opportunity to fix Obamacare, and there is a lot to fix,” she said. Collins cited the problem of rising premiums but also noted the   provisions of Obamacare that, she said, “enjoy widespread support. ” Many of my colleagues have ideas about ways to reform health care, myself included.  I look forward to evaluating all legislative reform proposals introduced in the new Congress to increase the availability of affordable, quality health care for millions of Americans. A spokeswoman for Collins, Annie Clark, followed up after this article was published to note that the Maine senator had voted against the repeal bill in 2015 because it also defunded Planned Parenthood. “Senator Collins has long supported the effort to repeal and replace,” Clark said. She added that Collins would have to see the specifics of the repeal bill next year before deciding how to vote on it. The other potential problem is Senator Lamar Alexander, who as chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, will have a lot to say about the repeal effort. Alexander voted for repeal last year, but in recent days he has made clear that he prefers a different strategy for ending the ACA: “replace and then repeal. ” Explaining his position, Alexander cited Trump's interview on 60 Minutes, where he promised there would be no gap between the exit of Obamacare and the arrival of its replacement. In a statement on Thursday, he said he wanted repeal to occur in stages: Immediately in January, Congress and the administration can begin to repeal Obamacare and provide relief from the Obamacare emergency. And as   Trump has said, Congress should replace and repeal at the same time, which requires figuring out how to replace it before fully repealing it. To avoid the historic mistakes of Obamacare, that replacement should be implemented    to minimize disruptions and make sure the changes in the system work well. Conservatives especially know that a comprehensive health care solution —  even a Republican one —  for a country of 320 million people in 50 states won't work. The Problems With Delay, In theory, the delayed death strategy seems reasonable, even responsible. Republicans don't want to throw 20 million people off their health insurance if they can avoid it, and even the most ardent critics of the Affordable Care Act understand that a transition period is needed. “That gives us time to put the replacement in place and not just strip the rug out from under people,” said Representative Steve King of Iowa, who has been fighting Obamacare since its inception. “We need to give people confidence that we're planning for that. ” In practice, however, delay could be a disaster. Insurers have already been leaving the Obamacare exchanges, leading to fewer options and   plans for shoppers. Repealing the law could cause a further exodus long before the measure takes effect. As Robert Laszewski, the president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates, told Vox's Sarah Kliff: “The problem is when you have an insurance market, and the new administration declares it DOA, it will go into death throes. ” Laszewski and other industry experts have said that Congress could mitigate the fallout by temporarily increasing subsidies for insurance companies, but that is exactly the kind of policy that Republicans derided as a “bailout” and successfully killed a couple of years ago. The Challenge of a Replacement, There's a reason the Republicans hasn't been able to agree on a single, comprehensive legislative alternative to Obamacare in the last six years: Conservatives are divided on the details, health policy is incredibly complex, and the plans they have come up with will be difficult to sell to the public —  especially once Democrats start highlighting the many people who will lose Medicaid coverage or face higher costs as a result. Recall that Democrats only barely passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010 when they had 59 seats in the Senate, or seven more than the Republicans will control next year. Republicans, including Trump, have said for example that they want to keep the popular provisions of Obamacare covering people with preexisting conditions and adult children included in their parents' plans. But those consumer protections only work economically in tandem with the many other policies embedded in the Affordable Care Act that allow insurance companies to pay for sick people while still making a profit. One of those is the mandate that all individuals buy insurance, which Republicans will surely ax. Politically, Republicans need the delay, because unless they get really creative with the budget reconciliation process, they will require 60 Senate votes —  not 51 —  to pass a new health law. That means they'll need a group of Democrats to join them, and party leaders believe, or at least hope, that the passage of time will create the political conditions for bipartisanship. The thinking goes: Obama will be long out of office, and Democrats will have come to grips with the demise of the Affordable Care Act. Moreover, Republicans would use the urgency of a deadline for protecting millions from losing insurance as a cudgel to force Democrats to cooperate. “The blame will fall on the people who didn't want to do anything,” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters this week. Maybe. If Republicans set the deadline at the end of 2018, they would try to pressure the handful of Democrats who represent red states and face difficult reelection races to side with them. Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota are all prime targets. Or the Republicans could wait three years and bank on the likelihood that Republicans will expand their majority in the midterm elections. But the politics could just as easily go the other way: Democrats who have struggled to defend Obamacare for years will now be on the offensive, running ads against the Republican proposal. If Republicans can't get the votes for a new law, they will face pressure themselves to extend provisions of Obamacare that are set to expire in order to save constituents from losing insurance or subsidies that help them pay for it. The Affordable Care Act won't survive in its current form long past Trump's inauguration. As my colleague Vann R. Newkirk II explained, the law gives the secretary of health and human services broad administrative powers, and Trump's nominee, Representative Tom Price, is a leading conservative critic in the House. Even without immediate legislation, he could make regulatory decisions that undermine the law, such as declining to promote the insurance exchanges and the website through which people enroll in them. But Price can't kill off Obamacare himself, and the law's ultimate demise might be farther off than people think."
59947,82030,Keith Ellison and the Battle for the Democrats,Atlantic,David A. Graham,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"Deciding who will chair a political party probably isn't the most effective place to fight for the soul of that party. Did Reince Priebus or any of the people who supported his run for Republican National Committee chair foresee president Trump? But DNC chair is the slot that's open now, so that's where Democrat are hashing out their differences. Almost all of the pressures on and contradictions within the party can be projected onto Keith Ellison, the U. S. representative from Minnesota, who announced his bid for the spot shortly after the disastrous election for Democrats. That follows several years of disastrous cycles for the party —  despite Obama's two terms, Democrats have been pummeled at the state and national levels —  and the party stewardship of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, which is widely viewed as shiftless and failed. With the Democratic field for 2020 diffuse and enigmatic, the chairmanship is one place to fight the battle. Nancy Pelosi Wins Another Term as Democratic Leader  The central disagreement within the Democrats is being described as a debate between economic populism and identity politics, which were supposedly represented by the Bernie Sanders and Clinton campaigns, though that gloss is so simplistic as to be misleading. And of course that's also not really the question: It's less about which approach to pursue, than how to reconcile those two strains. The Democrats can't afford to abandon the espousal of minority rights, but as the presidential race showed, it also faces difficulties winning a presidential race without appealing to white   voters. There's also a generational struggle, between the aging, typically more centrist wing of the party and a younger, more liberal wing. Ellison, who at 53 is part of the younger guard, sits at an interesting intersection for these issues. On the one hand, as a black man and one of two Muslims in the House, he can't really avoid identity politics. (This is also the refrain from people of color, queer people, and others during the debate: We didn't choose identity politics we have no choice but to live them.) But Ellison is also an economic progressive and the   of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and he was an early and fervent endorser of Sanders' presidential bid, back in the days when Sanders was struggling to gain supporters of color. (In a moment that has gone viral, he also predicted that Trump could win the nomination when few others believed it.) Ellison has already collected an hefty list of endorsements, ranging from     Democrats —  like outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and his presumptive successor, Chuck Schumer —  as well as leaders of the party's progressive wing, including Senator Elizabeth Warren and Sanders. On Thursday, he released a platform for his run for DNC chair, which emphasizes a “focus on working people,” putting “accountability and inclusion” not far behind it. But the leading bullet points are about the    work of building grassroots support and revitalizing a party whose local parties have been battered. In a speech last week, Sanders criticized what he portrayed as a myopic focus on identity issues among Democrats. “It's not good enough for someone to say, ‘I'm a woman! Vote for me! '” he said. “No, that's not good enough. What we need is a woman who has the guts to stand up to Wall Street, to the insurance companies, to the drug companies, to the fossil fuel industry. ” The Vermont senator wasn't saying it wasn't important to have women and people of color in leadership he was saying it was insufficient. Ellison has tried to reconcile these two ideas in a slightly smoother fashion. “It's about the money. A lot has been made about the white working class. I think we'd better take a look at the working class of all colors,” he said on the Keepin' It 1600 podcast. For many young liberals and leftists, Ellison's attempt to fuse these ideas may look like the future of the Democrats, fluent in both identity issues and progressive economics. But the biggest impediment to Ellison winning might be his past. Critics are focusing on statements he made, particularly involving Israel and Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam. Ellison has said he was never a member of the Nation, but he was involved with the group, including helping to organize a Minnesota delegation to the 1995 Million Man March. He also defended Farrakhan, an open  . He has also been critical of Israeli policy toward Palestinians. These statements have been known for a while, and Ellison has apologized for them in the past. He said he should have looked into Farrakhan more closely and disavowed the leader once he had, and during his run for chair he has said that he supports the Democrats positions in favor of Israel and its right to   for a   solution, and against the    Movement. For the most part, that seemed to satisfy the Jewish left. The progressive group J Street backed Ellison, and so did Schumer, a stalwart defender of Israel. The   League issued a long, carefully worded statement, basically saying that Ellison needed to be very clear about distancing himself from past comments but that they took him at his word. On Thursday, CNN published a report detailing more of Ellison's past statements. One episode involved a speech by Stokely Carmichael, the   leader, at the University of Minnesota. The university's president criticized Carmichael, then going by the name Kwame Ture, for suggesting collaboration between Nazis and Zionists. Ellison, in turn, defended Carmichael and his right to speak on campus: “The University's position appears to be this: Political Zionism is   no matter what dubious circumstances Israel was founded under no matter what the Zionists do to the Palestinians and no matter what wicked regimes Israel allies itself with —  like South Africa. This position is untenable. ” That comment upset conservatives, although many on the right have spent the last year warning that liberal students trying to bar controversial speakers from college campuses posed a threat to free speech. In addition, a tape emerged that is apparently of Ellison speaking in 2010, complaining that U. S. policy in the Middle East was too focused on Israel. “The USA foreign policy in the Middle East is governed by what is good or bad through a country of 7 million people,” he says in the tape. “A region of 350 million all turns on a country of 7 million. Does that make sense? Is that logic?” In response, the ADL changed its mind. “Rep. Ellison's remarks are both deeply disturbing and disqualifying,” CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement. His words imply that U. S. foreign policy is based on religiously or national   special interests rather than simply on America's best interests” and added that they “raised the specter” of myths about Jewish control of the government. Ellison responded in an open letter that the audio had been “selectively edited and taken out of context” and restated his support for Israel. Will this be enough to derail Ellison? It's likely that younger Democrats as a whole, which is to say the party's base going forward, are less concerned than the ADL. They tend to be less tied to Israel and more friendly to Palestinians, while Louis Farrakhan is a dim and distant figure, assuming they have any idea who he is, or what the Nation of Islam stands for. (The very oldest Millennials were 14 at the time of the Million Man March.) Schumer, meanwhile, has not changed his mind. ”I stand by Rep. Ellison for DNC chair,” he said in an emailed statement. “We have discussed his views on Israel at length, and while I disagree with some of his past positions, I saw him orchestrate one of the most   platforms in decades by successfully persuading other skeptical committee members to adopt such a strong platform. As C‎hair of the DNC he has committed to continuing to uphold that platform and to convince others that they support it as well. ” Is there anything Ellison could say to redeem himself in the eyes of critics for these comments, and if so, what it would be? Even if he can find those words, or even if the current controversy is not enough to stop him, Ellison still won't have a totally clear path to the chairmanship. For one, there's more than one vision for changing the party, and Ellison may still focus too much on identity issues for some Democrats' tastes —  he's also still a long way from the lunchpail economic liberalism of Tim Ryan, the Northeast Ohio congressman who unsuccessfully challenged Nancy Pelosi for the Democratic House leadership this week. Meanwhile, the Democratic establishment still carries some punch, as demonstrated by both Clinton's nomination and Pelosi's reelection as leader. Obama loyalists are also said to be uneasy about Ellison and seeking alternative candidates. Ellison could represent one future for the Democrats, but the current leaders aren't necessarily ready to accept relegation to the past."
59948,82031,How Airlines Decide What Counts as a Near Miss,Atlantic,Richard Korman,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"One morning last April, a Delta Airlines passenger jet stormed down a runway at Atlanta's   International Airport, hitting 138 mph. It was about to leave for Miami when an   controller realized he had given the plane clearance to cross the path of another jet that had just landed. He hurriedly told the pilot to abort takeoff, which jolted the passengers and risked damaging the aircraft. Fortunately, there was plenty of runway left for the plane to stop. What happened that day became one of thousands of incidents captured each year in commercial aviation's multilayered incident and accident reporting system. The apologetic   controller filed a report to the U. S. Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, which decided it wasn't a potentially disastrous   and graded it a C, for no danger. Reports like these, which can be matched with technical information on speed and altitude automatically transmitted from aircraft, are submitted under agreements between the FAA, airline operators, service companies, and unions. Many are made anonymously. Like   analysts scrutinizing a constant river of messages, airline and FAA safety experts work to head off disasters by searching for trends in these incident reports. By any index, the system has saved lives and money the most recent commercial aviation fatality occurred in 2009, when a regional jet crashed outside of Buffalo, N. Y. But recently,   safety incidents at U. S. airports have been on the rise: As the Wall Street Journal reported this week, hazardous “runway incursions” jumped 25 percent this fiscal year, increasing for a third year in a row. There are questions about whether the FAA and airlines are learning all they can. Predictive safety depends on faithful reporting of these incidents, which the FAA defines, in essence, as unexpected mishaps: incidents that could affect safe operations and that involve no serious injury or substantial aircraft damage. Yet there's no clear line between what does and doesn't meet this definition. Publicly, only abbreviated summaries are posted for most incidents, and others get longer accounts scrubbed of some details. Much of what happens in the skies and on the runways, therefore, stays in the skies and on the runways. The safety of flying depends in part on how much data the aviation industry decides to collect —  and on what mishaps it determines are truly dangerous. * * * Safety experts have known the value of   tracking and   analysis in preventing tragedy since at least 1931, when engineer Herbert William Heinrich theorized in Industrial Accident Prevention: A Scientific Approach that there were 300   for every 29 accidents and every one serious accident or fatality. In Heinrich's model, the   incidents are the bottom of a pyramid, the accidents are the next level up, and the fatal accidents are at the top. Few now take the ratio literally, but the study of precursor events, aided by the processing power of computers and data mining, has helped to revolutionize safety management. In commercial aviation, separate reporting programs exist for airlines, air controllers, pilots, and technicians. The thousands of confessions, complaints, and other electronic data that roll in each quarter detail faux pas big and small, such as a clipped wing on a taxiway, or an unusually turbulent stretch that shakes up the passengers and crew. The FAA sees anonymity in this reporting as key. “We certainly would not get the transparency and type of data without the anonymity,” says Peggy Gilligan, the organization's associate administrator of aviation safety. The closest analogy in    life to such anonymous or   data collection would be if every time you accidentally blew through a   or   another driver on the freeway, you filed a report with your insurer without having to worry about your rate going up or policy renewal being turned down. Recently, I spent a few days wading through what is publicly available via the Aviation Safety Reporting System, where anonymous reports are organized by types of calamities. I read about how one crew of a Boeing 757 forgot to lower the wing flaps for a daytime landing because their attention was diverted by the crew of a plane ahead who said there was a coyote at the edge of the runway. In another report, the weary pilots of a regional jet on a   journey landed at an airport without permission. “These kinds of schedules are ridiculous.   …     [I]n hindsight I'm grateful nothing else happened,” a crew member wrote. Another database, the FAA   Data System, which is operated by NASA on behalf of the FAA, has a different look and feel and lacks these unedited crew narratives. You can still spot the   about the Atlanta airport runway incursion involving the two Delta flights, but the database's advantage is perspective it shows that there were a dozen runway incursions at Atlanta's   International Airport in 2015, most neither close nor very dangerous. * * * Recently, a team of scholars that wanted to know if the FAA and airlines were learning from all of their recorded incidents turned to the FAA   Data System and yet another database, the National Transportation Safety Board's aviation accident database. The National Transportation Safety Board investigates incidents and accidents to make safety recommendations to the FAA, and the FAA has become increasingly cooperative in sharing   safety information with the organization. In an article in the journal Risk Analysis, the researchers lauded the FAA and the industry's accomplishments of recent years. But when they compared prior accident and   data from 64 airlines over a   stretch, from 1990 to 2007, they found that airlines learn mostly from incidents that conjure the memory of a prior accident. And that could lead pilots and controllers and mechanics to slip into a frame of mind where they routinize   and   adjustments, a natural human tendency toward “the normalization of deviance,” the researchers wrote. “It's the ones that don't scare you that we want the most attention on,” says Robin L. Dillon —  Merrill, a professor at Georgetown University and one of the paper's three  . The researchers write in the study: the “prior   where risks were taken without negative consequence, deter any search for new routines” and “often reinforce dangerous behavior. ” The reaction to the journal article from Mark Millam, a vice president at the Flight Safety Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for aviation safety, was typical of multiple experts I spoke to about this study. He conceded that the paper was “an interesting statistical analysis,” but he also had trouble accepting any of the conclusions, because airlines and the FAA have so much data that isn't made public. (The FAA did not reply in detail to what is in the study, and pointed to their successes in safety as well as incident reporting.)   and her   relied on the FAA   Data System, so the study was based on FAA definitions of   alone. That includes, for example, bird strikes near airports. The FAA considers bird strikes “valuable safety information” that could affect aircraft design or   control near airports, but they usually don't trigger engine failure or other damage that could cause a crash or force a dangerous emergency landing. * * *   certainly acknowledges that classifying events as   is a delicate matter. She believes that the best way to define and use   is as an infrequent alarm or warning signal. Set the criteria too low, she warns, and there is the danger that incident will be so common that they are ignored as pesky nuisances. There are other perspectives. One is that the relentless collection of data the past two decades has reached a point of diminishing return. After a while, says Shawn Pruchnicki, a former pilot and faculty member at the Ohio State University Center for Aviation Studies, “everyone assumes more data is better, but more isn't better. ” Pruchnicki, like others who take what's called a   approach, believes in nurturing a culture that copes with and manages suddenly hazardous situations. Obsession with data, he says, is part of an obsession with rules, and long prescriptive rules are confining. An aborted takeoff, such as the one in April in Atlanta, may not be the culmination of mistakes, but a symbol of a resilient and flexible system. “It's all about understanding how the system responds to unfavorable events, how we respond, not the nitty gritty details. ” However carefully   are categorized,   and her   suggest commercial aviation make incident reporting even easier than it is and collect even more reports on even smaller and less obvious incidents. So how far should this go? If a pilot swerves or changes altitude suddenly to avoid a   collision, or needs to hit the brakes and abort a   and in neither instance breeches the required separation between aircraft, and no one is hurt and nothing damaged except the peace of mind of the passengers, does that automatically qualify as an incident? “If something is shaking the passengers up, I believe it should be further investigated,” says   —  even if it's ultimately not classified as an incident. “Unless the passengers are shaken up by everything,” she adds."

","David Sneddon, then a    Brigham Young University student, disappeared in August 2004 while hiking in China's Yunnan Province. When Chinese police and the U. S. Embassy could not find him, China said Sneddon likely fell to his death in Tiger Leaping Gorge    a theory his parents did not believe plausible. Sneddon's family claims on a website devoted to the search for him that they believe Sneddon was kidnapped by North Korea and is being held hostage there. The claim appears to have stemmed from information gathered over the years and recent comments from Choi   head of South Korea's Abductees' Family Union. On Wednesday, a Japanese news source reported that Sneddon was abducted by agents of the North Korean government and whisked away some 2, 500 miles from the Chinese province where he vanished. Yahoo News Japan also reported that Sneddon became an English tutor to Kim   the dictatorial leader of North Korea, and is now believed to have a wife and two children. The news outlet, which cited South Korea's Abductees' Family Union for the information, said Sneddon lives in Pyongyang, where he teaches English.  Sneddon's parents said they believe their son was taken by the North Korean regime for training purposes because of his fluency in Korean, according to the Deseret News.  Sneddon, who grew up in Nebraska, served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints in South Korea, the newspaper reported. His mother, Kathleen Sneddon, told the paper that the report about her son being in North Korea ”doesn't surprise me at all.” ”We just knew in our heart that he was alive, so we had to keep fighting,” she said, according to the paper. The newspaper also reported that the State Department announced Wednesday it has launched an investigation into Sneddon's disappearance.  The reported investigation comes after members of Utah's congressional delegation asked lawmakers in Washington to probe whether Sneddon had been abducted by North Korea. The province where Sneddon disappeared is in the far southwest corner of China, bordering Vietnam, Laos and Burma. When Sneddon's father and two brothers traveled to China to retrace his footsteps, they encountered a dozen eyewitnesses who saw and interacted with Sneddon before he disappeared more than 70 miles beyond the gorge.  Sneddon's family said they have renewed hope in their son's case, while also noting the number of people believed to have been abducted by the regime. ”One young man from Utah is a sad and woeful story. But when you look at the total number. ..” Roy Sneddon, David's father, told the Deseret News. ”Pray for the people of North Korea that their lives will change.”"

","  A   54 percent of American voters feel the U. S. is less safe today than it was before   according to the latest Fox News national poll. Voters also think:   A major terrorist attack is likely in the near future.   Last year's U. S.  agreement on Iran's nuclear program made the U. S. less safe.   The $400 million the U. S. paid Iran after American prisoners were released was ransom.   Terrorism is one of the most important issues facing the country.  The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage →   Clinton can do a better job handling the issue of terrorism than Trump. Here are the details behind those findings: Most voters, 80 percent, think it's at least somewhat likely a major attack “causing large numbers of American lives to be lost” will happen in the near future. Moreover, 37 percent feel it's “very likely” an attack will happen soon.  While that's down from the high of 43 percent in 2007, it's up from 24 percent who felt that way in 2011 (the last time this question was asked on a Fox News Poll). Some 54 percent think the USA is less safe now than before the September 11 attacks.    percent say the country is safer.  Last year, it was   percent (March 2015).  This is a fairly recent shift.  Prior to September 2014, more voters than not said the country was safer. CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS, Almost all Republicans (91 percent) and most independents (84 percent) think a major attack is likely soon.  Fewer Democrats, although still a majority, agree (67 percent).  Similarly, 52 percent of Democrats think the country is safer today, while 55 percent of independents and 70 percent of Republicans feel the opposite. By a   percent margin, voters trust Clinton over Trump to do a better job handling the issue of terrorism.  Earlier this month the candidates were tied on the issue, while voters trusted Trump over Clinton by 12 points in May (  percent).   “You might think that since people increasingly feel less safe than before   that this would be reflected in job ratings for Obama and, as a result, Clinton, as his preferred successor. But that isn't the case,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Republican pollster Daron Shaw.  “Obama's approval rating is at a high point for his second term    and voters see Clinton as the best candidate to handle terrorism.  That should really concern Trump. ” Since May, trust in Clinton to handle terrorism is up 13 points among both Democrats and independents, and up 3 points among Republicans. The issue of terrorism is second only to the economy when voters prioritize problems facing the country.  Thirty percent say the economy is the top issue, while 18 percent cite terrorism, and 10 percent say education.  Here's the rest of the list:  health care (8 percent) the federal deficit and race relations (6 percent each) foreign policy, climate change, and immigration (4 percent each) and drug addiction (2 percent). Earlier this month, the economy and terrorism were tied (22 percent each).  Current ratings are more in line with those from April, when 32 percent put the economy on top and 15 percent said terrorism. Meanwhile, 54 percent of voters think last year's nuclear deal with Iran has made the U. S. less safe.  Republicans (76 percent) are much more likely than independents (59 percent) and Democrats (30 percent) to feel that way.  The U. S. agreement with Iran lifts sanctions for 10 years in exchange for Iran curtailing its pursuit of a nuclear program over that time period. One in three voters (31 percent) thinks the deal has made the U. S. safer    a slight improvement over 26 percent a year ago (September 2015).  The poll also asks about the White House's position that the $400 million dollars the U. S. recently paid Iran was not a ransom payment for the release of American prisoners.  Voters disagree: by a   percent margin, they say it was ransom. Obama has had a net positive job rating for most of 2016, and that trend continues:  54 percent of voters approve of the job he's doing, while 43 percent disapprove.   This is Obama's highest approval rating since May 2011, soon after U. S. forces killed Usama bin Laden (  percent).  Earlier this month, it was   percent (July   2, 2016). The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1, 011 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw  Company Research (R) from August   2016.

","Kicking off the address in Cincinnati, Ohio, by invoking his campaign slogan, “America First,” Trump tried to settle any doubts about his support for the Armed Forces. He called for a     missile defense, a “total reform” of the Veterans Affairs Department and a policy of “peace through strength. ” “Nobody will be able to compete with us,” Trump said. His Democratic opponent a day earlier sought to deliver a hawkish message, calling the U. S. an “exceptional nation” and accusing Trump of thinking that approach is ”insulting to the rest of the world.” In his address, Trump renewed his call for an end to the “era of  . ” But he made clear that this approach does not mean letting down the country's guard. “These next four years, I will be uncompromising in the defense of the USA and our friends and our good allies.

See Latest Coverage → Trump spoke after a whirlwind day on the campaign trail Wednesday, when he flew down to Mexico City for a surprise meeting with President Enrique Pena Nieto, and then returned to the U. S. to deliver a detailed immigration policy speech in Phoenix. He vowed anew Wednesday night to build a southern border wall and create a deportation force to remove millions of illegal immigrants from the country. He stopped short, though, of calling for all illegal immigrants to be removed, stressing that immigration agents would focus on removing “criminal aliens. ” He reiterated Thursday that, “We are going to defend our border” and called for changing immigration screening procedures. At the top of the speech, Trump also called for ensuring American values are taught in school.   ”We will stop apologizing for America. And we will start celebrating America,” he said.  Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden hammered Trump during a campaign stop in Ohio with Clinton, casting him as an enemy of the little guy. “My biggest problem with Trump   …     is not his cockamamie policies.  It's the way he treats people,” Biden said, noting the Republican nominee made the phrase “you're fired' famous. Clinton running mate Tim Kaine, campaigning in New Hampshire, also said Trump “choked” during his meeting in Mexico by failing to discuss his demands that Mexico pay for a border wall with the country's president.  Clinton, who has an edge in many state and national polls, has been aggressively courting Republicans and independents who won't vote for Trump but are still discomfited by her campaign. On Wednesday, she stressed to the American Legion her experience on the Senate Armed Services Committee and as secretary of state and noted her role in advising Obama on the raid that killed Usama bin Laden, saying she was ”deeply honored” to take part. Offering insight into her foreign policy, Clinton said ”we can't cozy up to dictators, we have to stand up to them. We can't contain ISIS, we must defeat them and we will.” Clinton also promised to invest in the military and support veterans, pledging not to privatize the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs. She said the USA must modernize the military and embrace new tactics, noting that the country should ”treat cyberattacks just like any other attacks” and respond through economic, diplomatic and military means.

","That's according to the latest Fox News Poll. It's tough to say who stinks more.  A large   minority says both Clinton and Trump are “terrible” candidates.  Voters dislike each    and say they are dishonest and lack empathy.   Only 35 percent say Trump is honest and trustworthy, barely better than the 31 percent who say Clinton is.   Less than half of voters say “cares about people like me” fits Clinton (47 percent) and Trump (37 percent).

Sixty percent think Trump is “hiding something” in his tax returns.  By comparison, 44 percent say Clinton set up a private email server to “hide things. ”    percent say she did so for convenience.        percent of voters think it's likely the Clintons were selling influence to foreign contributors who made donations to the ClintonFoundation.  Even 43 percent of Democrats believe that.    By a   margin, more think it is fair for Clinton to call Trump a racist (46 percent) than it is for Trump to call Clinton a bigot (27 percent).

","  The State Department agreed Thursday to turn over all the planning schedules from Clinton's time serving as secretary of state to The Associated Press by   in an abrupt reversal from U. S. government lawyers' warning last week that hundreds of pages would not be released until after the presidential election. The decision will make available all of Clinton's    schedules before the presidential election. Those planning documents offer a detailed look at Clinton's daily routine during her   tenure as secretary of state between 2009 and 2013. The State Department provided the AP some of the Democratic presidential nominee's official calendars from her time at the department, but some of those calendars had been edited after her events and, in some cases, names of those who met with her had been omitted. The department has so far released about half of her more complete daily schedules. ”As stated in today's court filing, the Department had no objection to shifting its resources as long as its overall processing burden was not increased,” State Department Spokesperson John Kirby said in a statement. ”Consequently, the Department plans to complete its production of former Secretary Clinton's schedules not later than October 17. ”   The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage → The new agreement Thursday was drawn up after government lawyers told the AP last week that the department expected to release the last of the detailed daily schedules around Dec. 30, weeks after the election. The AP had objected to the delays. The daily schedules drew attention last week after the AP reviewed the two years of schedules released so far, plus Clinton's official calendars. From those, the AP determined that more than half the people who Clinton met or spoke with  —   outside of members of the U. S. or foreign governments  —   had donated to the ClintonFoundation either personally or through companies or groups. The AP's review focused on Clinton's discretionary contacts with outside interests and excluded her meetings or calls with federal officials or foreign government representatives, because those contacts were part of her regular diplomatic obligations. Clinton has said the AP's analysis was flawed because it did not account fully for all meetings and phone calls during her entire term as secretary. She also said the analysis should have included meetings with federal employees and foreign diplomats. The State Department's decision Thursday to turn over all of the   daily schedules by Oct. 17 means it will have to triple its pace of producing 600 pages a month. That production schedule was ordered last January by U. S. District Court Judge Richard Leon. The AP first asked for all Clinton's calendars in 2010 and again in 2013 under the U. S. Freedom of Information Act, but the State Department did not release them. After further delays, the AP sued the State Department in federal court in March 2015 to obtain the planning materials and other records, leading to Leon's order.

See Latest Coverage → “The trip led to the successful release of two American journalists who were being held in North Korea,” Urena said. “This request turned out to be unnecessary and the trip was able to occur without diplomatic passports. ” But Judicial Watch noted that federal law “strictly limits” such passports to certain individuals, including Foreign Service officers and those “having diplomatic status or comparable status because he or she is traveling abroad to carry out diplomatic duties on behalf of the U. S. Government. ” Their family members and government contractors also are eligible. “The idea that the State Department would even consider a diplomatic passport for ClintonFoundation executives is beyond belief,” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement. Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin also said the request was related to freeing the journalists. “Judicial Watch is now attacking State Department officials and the 42nd President of the USA for rescuing two American journalists from North Korea,” Schwerin said in a written statement. “This is a new low even for this   organization that has been going after the Clintons since the 1990s. ” The State Department referred Fox News back to the federal regulations, saying they could not comment on individual cases.  Judicial Watch said the new documents include 37 email exchanges not in the original 30, 000 handed over to the State Department. The Judicial Watch release comes on the heels of another release earlier this week between Band and Abedin. In that exchange of emails    released as part of a public records lawsuit filed by the conservative group Citizens United    Band suggested individuals from companies that had donated to the foundation be included at a State Department lunch with   President Hu Jintao scheduled for January 2011, according to ABC News.

","  The Romanian hacker who first exposed Clinton's use of personal email for government business was sentenced by a federal judge Thursday to 52 months in prison    and in a surprising development, Romanian authorities now want the    “Guccifer,” who continues to cooperate with U. S. investigators, sent home ”right away.” The hacker, whose real name is Marcel Lehel Lazar, breached the AOL account of longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal in 2013, and posted online the Clintonemail. com address. It was this revelation that ultimately led to the identification of Clinton's personal account and multiple servers, where sensitive government records were transmitted along with personal communications and ClintonFoundation business. Lazar, looking alert and with neatly trimmed hair, appeared in the Alexandria, Va. courtroom for the   hearing before U. S. District Judge James C. Cacheris. Prosecutors said the hacker took responsibility for his actions but showed no remorse for accessing the private online accounts of at least 100 Americans, and causing the public release of their information.   His   victims include Dorothy Bush Koch, the sister of former President George W. Bush former StateSecretary Colin Powell and Blumenthal, among others. After breaching Powell's account, Lazar said he identified Blumenthal in the contact list and successfully targeted him. Court documents filed Monday by the government say by ”the defendant's own estimate, his quote 'success rate' at gaining entry into private accounts was only   percent of his attempts.” Lazar said he used a   system to show which accounts were successfully breached. “From what I remember I was using red for accounts I hacked, orange for the ones I could hack, and green for the ones I tried to hack and was not able to,” he said, according to a heavily redacted FBI interview released by the court on Monday. Lazar is not a programmer, but appears to have a strong understanding of social networks and did extensive research on his targets, using publicly available biographical information, a cell phone and an old computer to successfully guess security questions to reset the account passwords. In May, he pleaded guilty to two counts of a   indictment  —   one involving the breach of Powell's personal account the other involving the account of a former member of the Joint Chiefs of Staffs. The Blumenthal hack is not connected to either charge. His public defender, Shannon Quill, asked for a more lenient sentence of 36 months, arguing he did not profit from the crimes. Quill said the separation from his family, including a young daughter, has been hard. Further, she indicated the Romanians now want him back to finish his   sentence there, which he'd been serving in his home country before his extradition to the U. S. That sentence is connected to the same series of hacks. His attorney indicated he could be sent back in the coming weeks, though a timeframe was not clear. Together with the sentence in the U. S. Quill said this would amount to ”a total global sentence of 10 years.” Cacheris, though, pressed both sides on how a transfer to Romania might work. The judge and lawyers for both sides all noted that Lazar continues to cooperate with U. S. investigators, though court filings did not provide detail beyond the hacker's efforts to recover the personal information of his victims and close security loopholes connected to their accounts.   The heavily redacted 2014 FBI interview also said Lazar claimed “since June the CIA knew where I lived, a fact I found out from the press, when the CIA chief paid visits to Romania and Russia, where he obtained my IP addresses. ”  Lazar was extradited to the U. S. in late March after considerable time, effort and expense by the U. S. government. There was no mention in court of Guccifer's claims earlier this year to NBC and Fox News that he had successfully breached Clinton's server on a handful of occasions. ”For me, it was easy . .. easy for me, for everybody,” Lazar told Fox News from his Alexandria jail in May, claiming he used Blumenthal's account as a stepping stone to the Clinton server.  In July, when asked by Congress about this claim, FBI Director James Comey said Guccifer lied about the breach. When Comey recommended against criminal charges for Clinton and her aides, over the use of multiple personal servers for government business, he emphasized that members of Clinton's inner circle were hacked, suggesting the personal server was vulnerable. ”We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial email accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account,” he said. Fox News met with Guccifer at the Alexandria detention center earlier this year, and conducted interviews by phone. Fox News has pending requests to interview Guccifer as part of its ongoing reporting of the Clinton email case and recent breaches of political committees by   cyber militias. The targeting of the U. S. electoral process was noted by Cacheris in court. Guccifer told Fox News he always used Russian proxy servers for his attacks. Fox News also has an outstanding FOIA request with the U. S. Marshals for Lazar's mug shot. At the close of the hearing, Lazar was remanded to the Marshals' custody.

Police reports show investigators believe alcohol and speed could be factors. The reckless murder charges involve the girls' deaths, Cross said, and the assault charges stem from injuries suffered by the girls' father, Pernell James of Brent, who was driving, and his female friend, Shontel Cutts. Halsell is free on bond. A lawyer representing him, James Sturdivant, declined comment on the indictment. The girls' relatives filed two civil lawsuits blaming Halsell for the deaths. Halsell's attorneys have filed a document in one of those cases saying the driver of the car carrying the girls failed to yield and contributed to the wreck. The girls' father told investigators he was driving about 65 mph on U. S. 82 when a car traveling ”at a very high rate of speed” struck his Ford Fiesta from the rear, crushing the Ford and sending it tumbling across the road, court documents state. A sworn statement by a state trooper said Halsell was driving a rental car at the time and told officers he thought he was on Interstate   not U. S. 82. Troopers said the girls were ejected. Halsell was driving to his native Louisiana to pick up his son at the time of the crash and was so intoxicated that he asked to see the victims' bodies, the trooper's statement said. The girls lived with their mother in Houston and their father, Pernell James of Brent, was returning home from Texas with them and a woman for a summertime visit, according to Brent Mayor Dennis Stripling. Court documents do not indicate that Halsell mentioned his career to officers, and a trooper spokesman has said authorities didn't realize he was a former astronaut until they saw news reports about the case. An online biography by NASA said Halsell's career with the space agency included five shuttle flights starting in 1994. He spent more than 1, 250 hours in space, serving as commander on three shuttle missions and pilot on two others. After the space shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003, Halsell helped lead NASA's    effort. He retired in 2006 and worked for at least two aerospace companies afterward, including ATK Launch Systems, Utah, according to his NASA biography."

","  With the 20th anniversary approaching in less than four months, Boulder, Colorado Police Chief Greg Testa released a video statement Thursday saying the department remains focused on the investigation into the death of JonBenet Ramsey. Ramsey was 6 years old when she was found dead in the basement of her family's home on the day after Christmas 1996. Her mother Patsy Ramsey called 911 to say her daughter was missing and a ransom note was found. Her father John Ramsey found her body. An autopsy declared she died of strangulation. “We have not and will not give up,” Testa said. “We remain focused on this investigation and finding justice for JonBenet. ” John and Patsy Ramsey constantly maintained they had nothing to do with the death even after they were the focus of a grand jury that first convened in September 1998. It was later revealed the grand jury decided to indict John and Patsy Ramsey, but   County District Attorney Alex Hunter did not sign the indictment, which was sealed for several years. Hunter said there was not enough evidence to file charges. In 2008,   County District Attorney Mary Lacy said DNA uncovered in the case had a “genetic profile (that) belongs to a male and does not belong to anyone in the Ramsey family. ” No member of the Ramsey family, including brother Burke Ramsey, were considered suspects, Lacy said. No charges have been filed in the case."

","“This is the future    the border is a very dangerous place,” an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) official told FoxNews. com, citing the threat of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) snipers,   missiles and terrorist tunnels. “Sending unmanned vehicles to do these patrols means that troops lives' are not at risk. ” Working with Israeli defense specialist Elbit Systems, IDF has equipped Ford   pickup trucks with specialized remote driving technology. The trucks, dubbed Border Protector Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) are also fitted with four driving cameras and a   observation camera to help operators identify threats. At the moment, the vehicles are unarmed. UGV testing began in July 2015 and the trucks became operational in February. Currently, each vehicle is driven by an operator in a remote control room using a steering wheel, joystick and pedals. In the next few months, the Israeli Army aims to deploy the UGVs   with the vehicle driving toward a map coordinate set by its operator. The trucks, however, will still need their operators to guide them around any obstacles in their path.   the trucks will need less human intervention. “In the future, we will have the capability of fully autonomous driving,” the IDF official added, noting that the UGVs will autonomously navigate any obstacles in their path. Troops can also drive the UGVs traditionally from the driver's seat. IDF declined to reveal how many UGVs are in operation or the exact timeframe for autonomous operation. Plans are also in place to add a weapon to the vehicle. “We think at the beginning of next year, we will get a machine gun on the vehicle that will be operated from a control room  —   the machine gun will not be autonomous,” said the IDF official. The UGV replaces the   Guardium vehicle that was deployed by Israeli forces in 2009. “The Guardium was unable to navigate obstacles by itself, but the UGV will be able to,” explained the official. The Israeli Army wants to eventually deploy the UGVs on Israel's other borders with Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Israel is not the only country looking to harness autonomous military vehicles. The U. S. Army, for example, recently tested driverless vehicle technology in Michigan. The Army's Tank Automotive Research and Development Center (TARDEC) also showcased one of its autonomous vehicles at the Detroit Auto Show earlier this year.

","  Physicians have separated a pair of conjoined twin girls who were born connected at the liver and, in a rare surgical case, at the heart, after completing a risky procedure made possible by   printing. In the operation, physicians at University of Florida Health Shands Children's Hospital had to avoid damaging the critical veins in both babies' hearts, as they were joined at the atrium —   the upper chamber where the blood enters the organ —   lead surgeon Dr. Mark Bleiweis said in a news release. “In the world, there have not been many successful separations with a cardiac connection,” Bleiweis, chief of pediatric and congenital cardiovascular surgery at UF health, said in the release. “It became a very challenging planning process for us, and, ultimately, a challenging separation. ” According to UF Health, conjoined twins occur in about one in 200, 000 live births, and survival of twins born connected at the heart is extremely rare. Often in these cases, doctors decide not to do separation surgery. Overall, only about 5 to 25 percent of conjoined twins survive. The twins at hand, named only as Scarlett and Savannah in the release, were born with a   connection, meaning they each had their own complete set of organs, but they were attached at not only the heart, but also the liver, the diaphragm and the sternum. Dr. Jennifer   director of the fetal cardiac program at Shands, began studying the twins' physiology while their mother, named only as Jacquelyn in the release, was 21 weeks pregnant. Jacquelyn said when she learned her twins were conjoined at 20 weeks pregnant, her previous doctor told her the babies likely would not survive. “We went in to find the sex of one baby and found out not only were they twins, but they were conjoined and weren't going to make it,” Jacquelyn said in the release. “Many opinions later, we found Dr.   and she told us not only were our twins going to live, but they thought they could separate them. ”   and her team produced what they said appeared to be the first   printed conjoined twin heart to help the surgical team plan and practice for the operation. “When I saw the heart structures and liver structures in utero, I had a feeling that we could separate them, but I had to examine the anatomy more closely and consult with my cardiology colleagues at the UF Health Congenital Heart Center,”   said in the release. “I was able to give them hope, yet at the same time, I told them I was cautiously optimistic.   …     We are very fortunate that this was a success. ” Dr. Saleem Islam, chief of the division of pediatric surgery in the UF College of Medicine, used an intraoperative ultrasound to navigate separation of the newborns' single large, fused liver. The technology helped Islam and his team identify parts of the liver where large blood vessels were absent. In a   to   surgery, four surgeons and two anesthesiologists, as well as a team of imaging specialists, multiple nurses and an ancillary staff successfully separated the infants. According to the release, physicians wrapped the twins with tubing and electrical wiring, and to be able to tell them apart, they wrapped orange tape on one of the twins and blue tape on the other. After their babies have undergone more than a dozen surgeries each, Jacquelyn and her partner Mark are preparing to bring them home. “I know that Mark and Jackie were told by many not to pursue this because it was daunting, and it could not and would not be successful,” Bleiweis said in the release. “Nothing gives us greater satisfaction than seeing the two twins separated, and to see both parents holding their twins. ”  "

","Trump's lawyers argued Thursday that Stein should not be allowed to seek the recount because she was not “aggrieved” as the potential miscount could not conceivably have cost her the election. They also argued that Stein waited so late to file her recount petition, which the candidate filed Wednesday, that it will be impossible to finish by the Dec. 13 deadline. “Stein, in fact, finished no higher than fourth in any state where she appeared on the ballot. Yet despite being just a blip on the electoral radar, Stein has now commandeered Michigan's electoral process,” they wrote in their filing. ”[The law] has never been understood to permit challenges by   (and thus not aggrieved) candidates like Stein,” the argued. The objections from Trump's team suspends the planned Friday start of the recount until next week. A recount is already underway in Wisconsin, and Stein is also pushing for a   statewide recount in Pennsylvania. Trump won Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in the election  —   all states that pollsters had predicted would go to Trump's Democratic rival Clinton. Michigan's Attorney General Bill Schuette, a Republican, backed the Trump campaign's arguments Friday, and asked the state Supreme Court to block the recount. Stein blasted what she called Trump's “cynical efforts to delay the recount and create unnecessary costs for taxpayers,” which she called “shameful and outrageous. ” Stein has argued, without any evidence, that irregularities in the vote suggests there could have been a cyberattack on voting machines that tampered with the vote. She says the only way to be sure is to verify the vote through a recount. Experts cast doubt on the efficacy of the recounts, saying that it was unlikely they would flip anything close to the number of votes to change the outcome in any of the states in question. ”This is certainly not Bush v. Gore,” Mike Haas, Wisconsin's chief elections administrator, told The Associated Press. The Wisconsin recount was estimated to cost about $3. 9 million. Stein paid $973, 250 for the requested recount in Michigan. Michigan's Republican secretary of state, Ruth Johnson, has said a recount could cost $5 million total.

","Key members of the Trump and Clinton presidential campaigns exchanged sharp words at a Harvard University forum Thursday, with Democratic staffers accusing their counterparts of cultivating white supremacists. TRUMP REPORTEDLY 'FURIOUS' ABOUT CONWAY'S COMMENTS ON ROMNEY, ”The platform that they gave to white supremacists, to white nationalists, is a very, very important moment in our history,” Clinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri told Trump's team. The charge prompted a furious response from Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. “Do you think I ran a campaign where white supremacists had a platform?” Conway shot back. “You did, Kellyanne. You did,” an emotional Palmieri responded. The exchange was one of several tense moments during the traditionally cordial   review hosted at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. TRUMP CHOOSES OBAMACARE CRITIC TO REVAMP HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, Conway was still seething Friday, in an appearance on ”Fox  Friends” during which she was asked if the Clinton staffers were ”sore losers.” ”I do think some people are stuck in the permanent campaign and not really past the anger, grief and denial stages and into the acceptance stages,” Conway said. ”But that's okay, because we won.” At the event, Conway bristled during a    period when someone attending the forum noted the Southern Poverty Law Center had collected reports of nearly 1, 000   incidents from almost every state since the election. She said Trump has called for an end to such incidents, and she labeled the   center an ”  group.”  Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook placed the blame for his candidate's defeat on FBI Director James Comey, who sent letters to Congress in the waning days of the campaign related to his agency's examination of Clinton's email accounts. Without those letters, Mook said, Clinton would have won. He called the focus on Clinton's emails during the campaign one of the ”most   overhyped,   stories in the history of American politics.” Mook also blamed another set of emails for Clinton's loss, namely the slow release of apparently hacked Democratic messages in the final weeks of the race.  The U. S. government has said Russia was responsible for hacking at least some of the emails released by WikiLeaks, including those from the private account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. ”We cannot have foreign aggressors intervening in our elections,” Mook said. Asked about the reports of   hacking, which Russia has dismissed, Conway said, ”We just don't know it to be true.” When the discussion turned to campaign tactics, Conway said one key move that helped Trump was the decision to stop looking at national polls and instead focus on state polls, particularly in swing states. ”When I came onboard [as campaign manager in August] we never did another national poll,” she said.  Conway added that a mistake made by the Clinton campaign was assuming the 2016 electorate would resemble the 2012 electorate, which gave Democratic Obama a second term, when it was closer to the 2014 midterm electorate, which handed big gains to Republicans in Congress. She also credited Vermont U. S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Democratic primary challenger, for helping ”soften up” Clinton and paving the way for Trump's victory. She said political observers who predicted the race would go to Clinton ”ignored the phenomenon known as Bernie Sanders.” Another key to Trump's win, Conway said, was Clinton herself. ”I said to Mr. Trump, 'You're running against one of the most joyless presidential candidates in history,'” Conway said. ”'Why don't we find a way to be the happy warrior? '” Mook conceded that the Clinton campaign failed to perform as well as it should have among groups that were key to Obama's two victories, including suburban women and young voters, some of whom he said were drawn to   candidates. Conway essentially agreed, saying Clinton was unable to hold together the Obama coalition. She said the question wasn't whether voters were ready to elect a woman to the White House but whether they were ready to elect this particular woman. Another Clinton failing was in presuming that people who voted Democratic before would do so again, Conway said. But Mook said the Clinton campaign never took a win as a foregone conclusion. ”There were a lot of headwinds in this race,” he said. ”We were trying to make history.” Click for more from The Wall Street Journal.

","Trump made the surprise announcement about Mattis' appointment during a rally in Ohio Thursday night, calling him “the closest thing to General Patton that we have. ” Mattis —  known as “Mad Dog” and “Warrior Monk,” is a former   Marine Corps general who served more than 40 years in the military before he retired from his post as Commander of the U. S. Central Command in 2013 following reports that he was not in lockstep with Obama.  The appointment of the    Mattis has thus far received positive responses from current and former U. S. officials and lawmakers.  “Jim, as everyone knows, is a   tough Marine  —  but he is also quite cerebral in that he is contemplative, thoughtful, and studious,” Gen. Jack Keane, who withdrew himself from consideration for the post in Trump's Cabinet, told Fox News. “He is an excellent listener and he has extraordinary intellectual depth that will serve him well in making recommendations to the    concerning policy formulation and when  —  or not  —   to employ military force. ”  One retired Marine who served under Mattis told Fox News that the commander would prefer to “win without fighting. ”   “He is a proponent of understanding the mind of your enemy, because that is where the battle is won,” said retired Marine Officer Stan Coerr. “Gen. Mattis is the archetype of the warrior scholar  —  that's who we younger officers aspired to be. ” Coerr told Fox News that Mattis was an “on the ground, living in the dirt” commander, and a very deep thinker.  “He has said that he's never come across a situation he didn't know how to handle because he's always read about what he's seen,” Coerr recalled.  Retired Col. Chris Woodbridge, USMC, who served for the first time with Mattis in one of the first units deployed to Saudi Arabia when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, told Fox News that he recalled Mattis telling him and his fellow officers that they should spend as much time reading and studying the profession as they did in physical training.  “He has the ability, through his intellect and his force of personality  —  his social energy —  to put a sense of urgency into any organization,” Woodbridge said. “And if you don't have that depth of knowledge that you get from studying our military history like Gen. Mattis suggests, you're at a disadvantage. ”  But U. S. law says a Defense Secretary must have been out of uniform for at least seven years, and Mattis has only been retired for three, meaning he will need a waiver from Congress to be confirmed for the post.  The law is part of the 1947 National Security Act created at the inception of the Pentagon and the Department of Defense.  Lawrence Korb, the Assistant Secretary of Defense under the Reagan Administration, said that while he thinks Mattis is a “wonderful person,” there is “a reason we wrote this law. ”   “Gen. Mattis will give the   unfiltered advice  —   my worry is what filter he sees it through,” Korb told Fox News. “I want someone in the Pentagon who makes sure their military advice is not filtered by their career. ”   Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( ) also has raised concerns.  “While I deeply respect Gen. Mattis' service, I will oppose a waiver,” Gillibrand said in a statement. “Civilian control of our military is a fundamental principle of American democracy, and I will not vote for an exception to this rule. ”  But according to the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Mac Thornberry,   Mattis won't have trouble getting the waiver  —  and will be the first to do so since Gen. George S. Marshall.  “Gen. Mattis will enjoy wide support among Democrats and Republicans,” Gen. Keane told Fox News. “He will be a strong proponent for rebuilding the U. S. military which has been atrophying these last eight years. ”      "

","“He absolutely values loyalty, particularly to those who were with him through thick and thin,” said Rep. Chris Collins,  . Y. who became the first member of Congress to publicly support Trump when he announced his endorsement on February 24. “Those of us who stood firm in our support, many of those are being named to some of the top posts, but they also are extremely talented people,” he added. As one who stood with the real estate mogul through everything, Collins could have hoped for the position of his choice, but has opted to remain in Congress and act as an informal congressional liaison. “I made very clear that the right place for me at this stage in my life was in Congress,” Collins told Foxnews. com, adding they both agreed he would assume an informal role as a congressional liaison to the transition team. Another transition team member, Tennessee Republican Marsha Blackburn, agreed loyalty is an important consideration for a president who is making many of the decisions himself. “I see him as putting on a personal touch. This is not going to be a transition where the decisions are going to delegated. This is one where the leader of the team is going to be involved in choosing a team,” she told Foxnews. com. “He wants to build a team that can work together,” she added. The core supporters in Congress will be able to shape the administration by staffing   positions and   level posts, and could be key figures in setting the agenda in Congress. While critics scoff, John Hudak, a senior fellow of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, says having a loyal inner circle is critically important to any leader. “He most definitely is bringing in people who have been loyal to him, which is not always a negative. For any executive, having people who you can trust not to leak information and who can provide honest advice is a necessity,” Hudak told Foxnews. com, However, he added, “too much loyalty can be even more damaging if those loyalists are ‘yes' men who do not feel comfortable enough to stand up to you. ”  Hudak said Obama's administration provides a cautionary tale. While his cabinet was diverse, his inner circle were loyalists, like Valerie Jarrett, and “that created a bubble around him that proved to be harmful to him. ” Richard Johnson, chair of the Political Science department at Oklahoma City University agreed, telling Foxnews. com that “it is very common for a president to reward those who were loyal to him from the beginning, so it is not unusual that Trump is doing the same with his Cabinet and administration selections. ” Blackburn noted that loyalty to those who boarded the Trump train first has not prevented Trump from naming a fierce critic, South Carolina Gov Nikki Haley, to serve as United Nations representative and that former Republicans presidential candidate Mitt Romney remains in contention for secretary of state. Two other congressional supporters  —   Rep. Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo  —   have seen their stock rise since Trump's victory. While former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao was picked to head the Department of Transportation rather than Barletta, the fierce advocate for immigration reform clearly has the  's ear. “We talked. I've worked with the   throughout the campaign. He knows my background and, as a member of the Executive Transition Team, we talked about the importance of his ideas and moving them forward in Congress and making sure that the transition goes well, as a member of that team.  We talked about that, as I said, and some other things,” he told The Washington Post. Barletta advised the campaign on immigration and transportation issues, but is being eyed as the next secretary of labor. Pompeo was tapped to lead the Central Intelligence Agency.   "

","But when it comes to the left, then they abandon that strategy. There is no  . They are not alternative. Their mainstream is radical and out of the American mainstream on almost everything.  This was quite obvious as liberals bemoaned the death of Fidel Castro, a man his own daughter called “a tyrant. ” The Rev. Jesse Jackson, Sr. summed up years of devotion, recalling how, “the oppressed the world over joined Castro's cause of fighting for freedom  liberation. ”   TRUMP'S THREE GREATEST CHALLENGES, Some liberals distanced themselves from that love affair, though many have embraced   dictators from Stalin to Chavez. But, the left is even worse when it comes to policy, where it shows its true colors (red). On every major issue of the day, the left is unified. Taxes. Climate.   “free” college. Citizens United. Transgender    . ObamaCare. In each case and thousands more, the left wants more, bigger,   government. Liberals want higher taxes because they know how to spend your money better than you do    on what they want. They have turned climate science into a religion where disbelief is to be persecuted or even prosecuted.  Look at The NY Times' obsession with the topic and the bogus Paris “treaty” when staff interviewed Trump. And rather than examine the causes for spiking college costs, the left wants taxpayers to spend another $50 billion a year as the national debt nears $20 trillion. They also don't care that the Citizens United ruling let political opponents make a film about Clinton, that young girls might be forced to disrobe or shower next to men or that ObamaCare rates have skyrocketed. This is the essence of the liberal world view. The solution to every problem is bigger government.  If there are no regulations, then they are needed. If they exist, then there needs to be more and a   enforcement agency.  It's not a bug, it's a feature.  This is what we must start thinking of as the ” .” ”Alt,” not because they are out of the liberal mainstream. They aren't. Alternative because they are out of the mainstream of an America where 37 percent are conservative and 35 percent are moderate. Just 24 percent are liberal. Yet the most extreme of that 24 percent dominate our culture. Our TV, movies, music, plays and, yes, our news are controlled by those who   of America consider wildly out of step. The progressive,   agenda has conquered the traditional left's agenda. The   is everything bad the left claims about the right. It is extreme and doesn't want compromise. It wants to demonize or destroy opponents and intrude into every aspect of our lives.  Media outlets that bemoan Trump turning America to the right forget the   support a Socialist had running in the Democrat primary. Good,   liberalism has been replaced by a   radical brand. It's not just the policy positions. It's how the left enforces them. Opposing views are suppressed in any space liberals control    academia, Hollywood and media. Colleges and universities have become safe spaces for liberal thought while conservative speakers are regularly chased off campuses or harassed by rabid   protesters.  Hollywood spent a quarter century promoting Clinton for president and has already used nearly 30 TV shows to target the man who eventually defeated her.  Traditional media outlets accuse conservative websites of offering “fake” news but skip the rampant lunacy in places like The Huffington Post, Slate and, God help us, Salon. None of this is new. Liberals saw the Obama presidency as a chance to kill off conservativism and they used the tactics honed by brown shirts of the 1930s    including violence, vandalism and intimidation. They and their media allies then treat every such incident as the reincarnation of Gandhi. The   has been growing more publicly extreme since the arrival of Occupy Wall Street in 2011. Then, protesters vandalized, blocked traffic, intimidated and threatened police and set fires    all under the banner of “revolution. ” Even the   NY Times admitted Occupy Oakland had been a “riot. ” “Packs of protesters charged into businesses, overturning tables, shattering windows and smashing A. T. M. 's. ” When the Occupy protests were over, 7, 700 Occupiers had been arrested. Three were convicted “in a failed plot to bomb an Ohio bridge,” according to The Los Angeles Times. The rallying cry for Occupy, “We are the 99 percent,” can be traced directly back to   stalwarts like Vanity Fair, PBS and others. Liberals don't recall Occupy as criminal or dangerous. HuffPo's “Occupy Wall Street” page shows no evidence of any controversy, any violence. In fact, the site's page celebrates Occupiers with “10 Iconic Photos Of Occupy Wall Street, 3 Years Later” and a call to “Occupy Congress. ” Rich celebrities also supported the Occupiers    Yoko Ono, Russell Simmons and Alec Baldwin, to name just a few. Michael Moore wanted police to leave their posts and join the unrest like Egypt (which led to revolution). And the major media celebrated them almost as much. The   didn't end with the Occupy movement. It got worse. New groups appeared, embracing the aggressive tactics and a similar radical agenda, ranting “against the ravages of global capitalism. ” They rioted in Ferguson, based in part on false news reports about what Michael Brown allegedly said. “Hands Up, Don't Shoot” was born and we got more riots, more protests and more disruption. The actual phrase was never uttered, even The Washington Post and the Obama administration admit that.  It doesn't matter. The expression continues to be used throughout the left, as well as in major media from ABC to ESPN. In 2014, five St. Louis Rams players even held their hands up in a protest at a game. Their protest was based on a lie. The   didn't care. That protest has evolved and included the Black Friday, Ferguson, and ShutItDown protests, the Freddie Gray riot, Black Lives Matter and now the #NotMyPresident protests and riot. In the Freddie Gray riot alone, 130 police officers were injured, more than at any incident since  .  There was lots of ink in the   media to support the rioters, very little that even mentioned the injured police. The same thing happened when Black Lives Matter protesters injured 21 police in Minneapolis in July. Those weren't the only   unrest. Trump supporters were victims of similar assaults during the campaign. They were punched, attacked, egged and threatened. Major media blamed Trump by a factor of  .   media were worse. Liberal Prof. David Coates wrote in HuffPo to blame the right, saying the violence was all on angry Republicans, “an anger that has no parallel in and around the base of the Democrats. ” Classic misdirection. The   doesn't just use violence to enforce its will. It smears its opponents as racists and Nazis while journalists help them do it. Together they dredge up    comments from Sen. Jeff Sessions to say he's racist. Yet they ignore how liberals have helped kill 60 million mostly minority babies and never once accuse them of trying to genocide   and Hispanic communities. Only liberals are allowed to use ist words. When that doesn't work, the   turns to its deep bench of celebrities. We are flooded with climate change stories, many featuring Hollywood stars. Actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Woody Harrelson and director James Cameron are     climate scolds.  Liberal outlets never tell us about the carbon footprint of the   royal yacht DiCaprio rented. Or maybe how Harrelson had his vegan belt and shoes flown to France special. Cameron, for his part, owns a collection of motorcycles, cars, dirt bikes, a yacht, a helicopter    even a fleet of submarines. Yet he's a climate hero. None of that matters to either the   or the major media. But it matters to the rest of us.  The   is more than just a web of   liberal websites and pundits. It is the major media outlets and journalists who credential those sites and ideas. Some of Huffington Post's   readers are the very journalists who then claim neutrality on national issues. If this election didn't prove the traditional news media are devoted   nothing will.  Is there any doubt that The Times is just as   as Huffington Post? They share a common world view. They promote the same agendas. They mirror each other's disgust for things not liberal. So when Trump skewers Times liberals, he is taking on the massive creature that is the  .

","The trouble began over the Thanksgiving holiday when Reddit's CEO, Steve Huffman, secretly used his administrative access to the site to alter angry comments directed at him  —   changing the text of the comments to make them appear directed at Trump supporters on the site instead. After an uproar, Huffman admitted doing that and said “as the CEO, I shouldn't play such games, and it's all fixed now  …     I most assuredly won't do this again. ” But Wednesday, while issuing a further apology, Huffman announced that due to some “toxic” users, he would begin to censor all posts in a   section of the site (called “ ”) by limiting the ability of posts there to reach what many consider the “front page” of Reddit  —   where the posts get seen by a wider audience. REDDIT ADMINISTRATORS ACCUSED OF CENSORSHIP, Huffman added: “We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans. ” Reddit's “ ” community has more than 300, 000 users, who are known for being both enthusiastic and irreverent. In July, Trump visited the page and answered fans' questions there. Reddit and the company that owns it, Advance Publications, did not respond to requests for comment. Huffman also hinted that he may further target the Trump section of Reddit. Responding to a question Thursday about whether the new limits impacted anyone besides the “ ” community, he replied, “Right now, just them  …     Going forward, we'll just take away their toys specifically and move on. ” REDDIT UPDATES CONTENT POLICY, BANS A 'HANDFUL' OF GROUPS THAT EXIST 'SOLELY TO ANNOY' OTHERS, Many Reddit users welcomed their CEO's crackdown on the Trump section, with some saying he should go further. “'The_donald' is not something that should be on Reddit  …     It should be banned, along with all its members,” user “Tyler_Vakarian” wrote. The volunteer moderators who support and run the Trump section of Reddit told FoxNews. com through a spokesperson (user “PrinceCamelton”) that they were not surprised by the censorship given censorship by other social media CEOs such as Twitter's Jack Dorsey  —   but were surprised that Huffman had not apologized to the users of   for using his administrative access to falsely direct angry comments towards them. “Huffman has not directly issued our community an apology. Instead, he has the audacity to call us ‘toxic.' They are trying to control and push the radical   narrative that our country has turned away by electing Mr. Trump. ” ACTOR JAMES WOODS LEAVES TWITTER OVER   'CENSORSHIP' The moderators added that their section of Reddit does not allow either hateful comments or harassment. “We are not a toxic community. Huffman is trying to frame us as a community that harbors harassment. This couldn't be any further from the truth. We have let our community know multiple times that we do not support harassment. We've even been complimented by the Staff Coordinator of Reddit,” moderators from “ ” told FoxNews. com in an emailed statement. The moderators said that despite the limits imposed on them, they will continue spreading their   message on the site as long as they are allowed to. “We live in a phenomenal information age that makes it so easy to pass on information.

","Such is politics, but both men, whether they will admit or not, will indirectly depend on the other to preserve key components of their power and prestige. That is because of the unfolding drama to commence in Trump's first days in office: filling the current vacancy on the Supreme Court. It is one of the few times the highest levels of the three branches collide in a political fight that typically lasts only weeks, but whose effects can ripple for decades. A nominee is chosen by the president, then confirmed by the Senate. Once she or he takes the judicial oath, however, all bets are    now free to decide cases from any political or personal allegiance.   ”The judicial branch will be an important check in the next few years. And I think there might be conservative justices put on the bench who are more traditionally conservative and not as authoritarian perhaps as a Trump might be,” Elizabeth Wydra, president of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center said FoxNews. com. ”And they can serve as a check, especially if there are threats to constitutional structure.” Maybe that is what worries Trump and his conservative    they may believe Roberts has not been someone you can take for granted, and would vote a certain way every time. This despite the chief justice being nominated by President George W. Bush and having an   reliably conservative record. Replacing Scalia with another conservative will likely not shift the balance of the court and its shaky   majority in the short term. But the next    whether possibly Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Anthony Kennedy, or Stephen Breyer, all in their late 70s or    have the potential to be game changers. If and until then, having Roberts lead the conservative charge will be to Trump's advantage, regardless of the  's insults. The chief justice for his part has not responded to Trump, and given his steady,   leadership under both Republican and Democratic presidents, the    Roberts is unlikely to care much what is said about him personally. Life tenure on the bench gives you that security. Court of Public Opinion, But what colleagues close to Roberts say he does care about is political attacks on the court as an institution and its role as a fair arbiter of the rule of law. Credibility and legitimacy matter.  The ”chief,” as he is informally known around the court, has publicly stated his   efforts to forge consensus with his colleagues whenever possible, show respect for precedent, and to preserve the court's reputation. In a 2014 speech, he noted the ”partisan rancor” in Congress ”impedes their ability to carry out their functions. “I don't want this to spill over and affect us. That's not the way we do business.” The public mostly agrees. A Gallup poll in September found   of Americans surveyed have a great deal or fair amount of trust and confidence in the Supreme Court, far higher than the other two political branches. That number has remained roughly consistent the past five years.   But Trump has been more blunt, taking a   consistency when judging the judges. In particular, Roberts' dramatic 2012 deciding vote upholding the key funding provision of the Affordable Care    saving Obama's signature domestic achievement. Conservatives called it a calculated act of betrayal, a narrative Trump was all too eager to exploit on the campaign trail. ”Justice Roberts really let us down,” Trump said at a campaign rally last December. ”What he did with Obamacare was disgraceful, and I think he did that because he wanted to be popular inside the Beltway.” In other speeches, Trump used words like ”disappointment,” and a ”nightmare.” He has cited Scalia and Justice Clarence Thomas as his favorites. With that template, the new president has publicly named 21    all but one a state or federal    from whom he has vowed to select his Supreme Court nominee. Trump has promised that person will be a reliable conservative, someone opposed to abortion rights and ”very   Amendment.” Roberts Role, The Chief Justice of the United    that's the official    has administrative control over the entire federal judiciary and the 866 or so appeal and district court judges, along with bankruptcy and magistrate judges. So filling those   vacancies with conservatives in the Trump mold would ostensibly have the greatest influence on the broader rule of law. ”These are the courts that actually decide the vast majority of litigation in the USA,” Thomas Dupree, a former Bush 43 Justice Department official, and a top appellate attorney.  ”So when we look ahead to the next four, possibly eight years, Trump is going to have a massive impact on the judiciary.” Those judges would tackle    issues like executive power, immigration, environment, and criminal    and of course   social issues like abortion, marriage equality, and legalizing marijuana. And since the Supreme Court only takes up about   of the appeals presented to them for full review, the lower courts will largely determine whether significant parts of the Trump agenda survive judicial scrutiny. And since the high court gets the final    the president can only hope    and Kennedy to some    stick with fellow conservatives. Some liberal activists hold out tenuous hope Roberts takes a more active role as a ”swing”    now occupied almost exclusively by    but there is little immediate evidence he will drift left with abandon. Roberts wrote the dissent last year when the court struck down state laws banning   marriage. He said the   majority's    authored by    of a nationwide right guaranteed by equal protection and due process, was misguided. In language many social conservatives applauded, Roberts said the opinion was about political will, not legal judgment. “The court invalidates the marriage laws of more than half the states and orders the transformation of a social institution that has formed the basis of human society for millennia,” he said.  ”Just who do we think we are?” This past spring he was firmly in the conservative camp in two   cases: on the losing side when Texas' restrictions on abortion clinic access were tossed out as overly burdensome to women seeking the procedure and prevailing when Obama's executive action on immigration was blocked from going into effect. Political Football, Ten days before Scalia's death in February, Roberts was unusually candid making the case courts should have a limited role, resisting the temptation to be the final arbiter of issues great and small. And he offered a prescient warning of sorts of the effects a partisan fight over filling the pending and future Supreme Court vacancies can have. ”We don't work as Democrats or Republicans, and I think it's a very unfortunate perception that the public might get from the confirmation process,” he said. ”When you have a sharply political divisive hearing process, it increases the danger that whoever comes out of it will be viewed in those terms,” he said. Then Roberts indirectly addressed suggestions then roiling in the presidential primaries that he and the court were engaging in ”judicial activism'   the ultimate dis. ”If we uphold a particular political decision, that remains the decision of the political branches, and the fact that it may lead to criticism of us is often a mistake,” he said. ”We do have to be above or apart from the criticism because we, of course, make unpopular    very unpopular decisions.”   "

","The college in Amherst had lowered the U. S. flag to   after Election Day. The flag was found burned on Veterans Day, and the school chose to stop flying it  —   and any other flags  —   a week later. ”We understand that many who hold the flag as a powerful symbol of national ideals and their highest aspirations for the country    including members of our own community    felt hurt by our decisions, and that we deeply regret,” the college's president, Jonathan Lash, stated Friday. He added, ”We did not lower the flag to make a political statement. . ..

Last weekend, dozens of vets and other activists held American flags and chanted, ”U. S. A. ,” in a rally that organizers called a ”peaceful demonstration of freedom.” Mayor Domenic Sarno of nearby Springfield and others at the rally said the school's decision disrespected veterans and current military members. In video that aired Wednesday on ”The O'Reilly Factor,” Fox News' Jesse Watters confronted Lash, who refused to comment on the controversy at that time. ”Hampshire staff and faculty have led facilitated discussions, I have held multiple focus group sessions, and all of our students, faculty, and staff have been invited to contribute their opinions, questions, and perspectives about the U.

","The gustatory feat sets a record: It's the first invasive Burmese python (Python molurus bivittatus) caught with three deer in its gut, said study   author Scott Boback, an associate professor of biology at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania. The python probably attacked and ate the deer at different times over a   period, Boback said. That time span may seem long, but it's actually quite surprising that a snake would eat three enormous meals in a relatively short window, Boback told Live Science. [Photos: This Invasive Python Ate Three Wild Deer] ”If a python is capable of eating three deer in three months,” what else are they eating that we don't know about, he asked. ”We don't even know how many of them are out there [in the Everglades].” Burmese pythons are native to Southeast Asia, but for reasons still shrouded in mystery, they became established in the Everglades during the 1990s. The snakes can grow to be up to 18 feet long in the Everglades (and up to 26 feet long in Southeast Asia). They use their strong muscles to wrap around prey, obstructing their victims' blood flow until circulation stops. It's unclear how the python attacked the deer, but the snake may have hid in the water, waiting for the deer to stop for a drink. That would have left the deer within striking distance of the snake, Boback said. The 15.   female snake was almost done digesting its three massive meals when officials caught and euthanized it on June 3, 2013. A necropsy, or animal autopsy, revealed an empty stomach but intestines packed with poop. The fecal matter was immense: more than 14 lbs. or 13 percent of the snake's body mass  Boback said. Study   Teresa Hsu and Suzanne Peurach, scientists at the Smithsonian Institution, sieved through the excrement and found mats of fur and several undigested hooves, bones and teeth, indicating that the python had eaten   deer (Odocoileus virginianus)  —   and not just one, Boback said. It's no surprise that the fur, hooves and teeth were undigested, as pythons can't break down keratin or enamel, Boback said. However, they can digest bone, which would explain why the researchers found only fragments of bone in the dung, he said. The size and shape of the hooves  —   as well as the presence of a deciduous, or baby, tooth  —   indicated that the adult doe was at least 1 year old and about 99 lbs. one fawn was about 1 month old and 37 lbs. and the other fawn was about 2 weeks old and 29 lbs. the researchers wrote in the study. [In Images: Hungry Python Eats Porcupine Whole] Pythons are ravenous eaters, and they've been wreaking havoc on the Everglades ecosystem, Boback said. The hungry snakes hunt the region's native animals, including birds, mammals and at least one reptile  —   the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) the researchers wrote in the study. Although other Everglades studies have shown correlations between the presence of pythons and a drop in mammals  —   such as raccoons, opossums, bobcats and rabbits  —   the new report shows concrete evidence that pythons can eat more than one deer within a short period of time, Boback said. ”It just begs the question, 'How often are they eating these things? '” he said. The study was published in the November issue of the journal BioInvasions Records. Original article on Live Science ."

","It is perhaps unprecedented for a U. S. president or   to speak directly with a leader of Taiwan, a   island the U. S. broke diplomatic ties with in 1979. In first comments apparently meant to downplay the significance of the call, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Saturday that the contact between Taiwan's president and Trump was ”just a small trick by Taiwan” that he believed would not change U. S. policy toward China, according to Hong Kong's Phoenix TV. ”The   policy is the cornerstone of the healthy development of  . S. relations and we hope this political foundation will not be interfered with or damaged,” Wang was quoted as saying. Washington has pursued a   ”one China” policy since 1979, when it shifted diplomatic recognition of China from the government in Taiwan to the communist government on the mainland. Under that policy, the U. S. recognizes Beijing as representing China but retains unofficial ties with Taiwan. A statement from Trump's transition team said he spoke Friday with Taiwanese President Tsai   who offered her congratulations on his election win. Trump tweeted later that Tsai ”CALLED ME.” He also groused about the reaction to the call: ”Interesting how the U. S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.” The Taiwanese presidential office said Trump and Tsai discussed issues affecting Asia and the future of U. S. relations with Taiwan. ”The (Taiwanese) president is looking forward to strengthening bilateral interactions and contacts as well as setting up closer cooperative relations,” the statement said. Tsai also told Trump that she hoped the U. S. would support Taiwan in its participation in international affairs, the office said, in an apparent reference to China's efforts to isolate Taiwan from global institutions such as the United Nations. It said the two also discussed ”promoting domestic economic development and strengthening national defense” to improve the lives of ordinary people. Taiwan's presidential office spokesman Alex Huang said separately that Taiwan's relations with China and ”healthy”  . S. relations can proceed in parallel. ”There is no conflict (in that),” he told reporters in Taipei. The White House learned of the conversation after it had taken place, said a senior Obama administration official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive diplomatic relations involved. China's embassy in Washington and its foreign ministry and Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing did not respond to requests for comment. Friday's call is the starkest example yet of how Trump has flouted diplomatic conventions since he won the Nov. 8 election. He has apparently undertaken calls with foreign leaders without guidance customarily lent by the State Department, which oversees U. S. diplomacy. ”  Trump is just shooting from the hip, trying to take phone calls of congratulatory messages from leaders around the world without consideration for the implications,” said Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Glaser said such a call was ”completely unprecedented” or at least has never been known publicly. China is likely to be trying to identify whether this signals any intent on the part of Trump to alter   U. S. policy toward Taiwan, Glaser said. ”They will hope that this is a misstep, but I think privately, they will definitely seek to educate this incoming president and ensure that he understands the sensitivity of Taiwan,” she said. In particular, China would want to highlight to the incoming administration the risks involved in any form of signal from the USA that it supports strengthening a relationship with Taiwan under a president that Beijing views as   Glaser added. Last month, Trump had a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping during which Trump's office described him as saying he believed the two would have ”one of the strongest relationships for both countries.” Despite China's muted response Saturday, concern about Trump's policy toward China is growing, said Shi Yinhong of Renmin University in Beijing, one of China's   international relations scholars. ”In the mind of Chinese leaders, concerns are mounting about U. S. policy toward China” under Trump's administration, Shi said. Tsai was elected in January and took office in May. The traditional   policies of her party have strained relations with Beijing. The call with Trump could ”convince people in Taiwan that the island can establish good relations with the U. S. and encourage (Tsai) to continue to resist pressure from Beijing,” Shi said. Over the decades, the status of Taiwan has been one of the most sensitive issues in U. S.  relations. China regards Taiwan as part of its territory to be retaken by force, if necessary, if it seeks independence. It would regard any recognition of a Taiwanese leader as a head of state as unacceptable. Taiwan split from the Chinese mainland amid civil war in 1949. The U. S. policy acknowledges the Chinese view over sovereignty, but considers Taiwan's status as unsettled. The U. S. has legal commitments to help Taiwan maintain the ability to defend itself. Taiwan's official Central News Agency said Edwin Feulner, former president of the Heritage Foundation, a   conservative think tank, was a ”crucial figure” in setting up communication channels between the sides, leading to the call. Feulner could not immediately be reached to comment on the report, which cited anonymous sources. Feulner had met with Tsai in October when he led a delegation from the think tank on a trip to Taiwan, according to a release at the time from Taiwan's presidential office. That release says Tsai called Feulner a ”longtime friend to Taiwan” and conveyed her gratitude to his foundation for its support. Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said Trump's conversation does not signal any change to   U. S. policy on   issues. In Beijing, a U.

PHOTO SHOWS TENNESSEE FIREFIGHTERS CATCHING THEIR FIRST NAP IN 36 HOURS, ”I can't describe to you the feelings we have over this tragedy,” he said during a news conference with the governor and U. S. senators. Local officials, bowing to pressure from frustrated property owners, said they would allow people back into most parts of the city Friday morning. Residents have to pass through a checkpoint and must show some proof of ownership or residency, Gatlinburg City Manager Cindy Cameron Ogle said. DOWNPOURS TO RAISE FLASH FLOOD RISK FROM TEXAS TO ALABAMA, ”The city is not implying that private property is safe,” she said. ”People may encounter downed powerlines or other hazards.” Among those anxiously waiting to return was Tracy Mayberry. He and his wife,    son and five dogs have bounced between hotels since they were forced to evacuate their rental home Monday night. They were struggling to find a place to stay Thursday as many lodges began to discontinue the special rates for evacuees. ”It feels like Gatlinburg is more worried about how to rebuild than they are about their people,” he said. In nearby communities, there were signs of normalcy. In Pigeon Forge, the Comedy House rented an electronic billboard message that said it was open. A hotel flyer urged guests to check out the scenic Cades Cove loop: ”Take a drive and remember what you love about the Smokies!” Dollywood, the amusement park named after Parton, will reopen Friday afternoon after it was spared any damage. The Associated Press was allowed access into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park on Thursday. A forest of bare trees standing amid a scorched landscape could be seen along with fire crews sawing up a tree stump. In Gatlinburg, the center of the devastation, officials there hope to open the city's main roads to the public by Wednesday. Authorities searching the charred remains of homes and businesses said they expected to finish by nightfall Friday. Despite recent heavy rains, fire officials warned people shouldn't have a false sense of security because months of drought have left the ground  . Wildfires can rekindle, they said. The trouble began Monday when a wildfire, likely caused by a person, spread from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park into the Gatlinburg area as   winds toppled trees and power lines, blowing embers in all directions. ”We had trees going down everywhere, power lines, all those power lines were just like lighting a match because of the extreme drought conditions. So we went from nothing to over   structure fires in a matter of minutes. And that grew and that grew and that grew,” Gatlinburg Fire Chief Greg Miller said. More than 14, 000 residents and visitors in Gatlinburg were forced to evacuate, and the typically bustling tourist city has been shuttered ever since. Great Smoky Mountains National Park Superintendent Cassius Cash has said the fires were ”likely to be  ” but he has refused to elaborate, saying only that the investigation continues. Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are helping investigate the cause."

But what was actually said regarding a key tenet of the Republican nominee's campaign  —   that Mexico will pay for a controversial border wall  —   was in dispute after both men gave differing accounts. Appearing alongside Peña Nieto on Wednesday, Trump told reporters that he brought up his pledge to build a border wall, but that the two did not discuss who would pay for it. “Who pays for the wall?” Trump said. “We didn't discuss that. ” Hours later, however, Peña Nieto tweeted that they did indeed discuss payment and that he “made clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall. ” Al inicio de la conversaciÃ³n con Trump dejÃ"

","'Killer Robots By Air  …    ' '  …    And By Sea And By Land' 'CUPID'] A very, very small quadcopter, one inch in diameter can carry a   or   shaped charge. You can order them from a drone manufacturer in China. You can program the code to say: “Here are thousands of photographs of the kinds of things I want to target. ” A   shaped charge can punch a hole in nine millimeters of steel, so presumably you can also punch a hole in someone's head. You can fit about three million of those in a   . You can drive up   with three trucks and have 10 million weapons attacking NY City. They don't have to be very effective, only 5 or 10% of them have to find the target. There will be manufacturers producing millions of these weapons that people will be able to buy just like you can buy guns now, except millions of guns don't matter unless you have a million soldiers. You need only three guys to write the program and launch them. So you can just imagine that in many parts of the world humans will be hunted. They will be cowering underground in shelters and devising techniques so that they don't get detected. This is the   cloud of lethal autonomous weapons. They could be here in two to three years.  —   Stuart Russell, professor of computer science and engineering at the University of California Berkeley, Mary Wareham laughs a lot. It usually sounds the same regardless of the circumstance  —   like a mirthful giggle the blonde New Zealander can't suppress  —   but it bubbles up at the most varied moments. Wareham laughs when things are funny, she laughs when things are awkward, she laughs when she disagrees with you. And she laughs when things are truly unpleasant, like when you're talking to her about how humanity might soon be annihilated by killer robots and the world is doing nothing to stop it. One afternoon this spring at the United Nations in Geneva, I sat behind Wareham in a large     assembly room that hosted the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) a group of 121 countries that have signed the agreement to restrict weapons that “are considered to cause unnecessary or unjustifiable suffering to combatants or to affect civilians indiscriminately” —   in other words, weapons humanity deems too cruel to use in war. The UN moves at a glacial pace, but the CCW is even worse. There's no vote at the end of meetings instead, every contracting party needs to agree in order to get anything done. (Its last and only successful prohibitive weapons ban was in 1995.) It was the start of five days of meetings to discuss lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS): weapons that have the ability to independently select and engage targets, i. e. machines that can make the decision to kill humans, i. e. killer robots. The world slept through the advent of drone attacks. When it came to LAWS would we do the same? Yet it's important to get one thing clear: This isn't a conversation about drones. By now, drone warfare has been normalized  —   at least 10 countries have them.   cars are tested in fleets. Twenty years ago, a computer beat Garry Kasparov at chess and, more recently, another taught itself how to beat humans at Go, a Chinese game of strategy that doesn't rely as much on patterns and probability. In July, the Dallas police department sent a robot strapped with explosives to kill an active shooter following an attack on police officers during a protest. But with LAWS, unlike the Dallas robot, the human sets the parameters of the attack without actually knowing the specific target. The weapon goes out, looks for anything within those parameters, hones in, and detonates. Examples that don't sound entirely     are things like all enemy ships in the South China Sea, all military radars in X country, all enemy tanks on the plains of Europe. But scale it up, add   actors, and you can envision strange permutations: all power stations, all schools, all hospitals, all   males carrying weapons, all   males wearing baseball caps, those with brown hair. Use your imagination. While this sounds like the kind of horror you pay to see in theaters, killer robots will shortly be arriving at your front door for free courtesy of Russia, China, or the US, all of which are racing to develop them. “There are really no technological breakthroughs that are required,” Russell, the computer science professor, told me. “Every one of the component technology is available in some form commercially   …     It's really a matter of just how much resources are invested in it. ” LAWS are generally broken down into three categories. Most simply, there's humans in the loop  —   where the machine performs the task under human supervision, arriving at the target and waiting for permission to fire. Humans on the loop  —   where the machine gets to the place and takes out the target, but the human can override the system. And then, humans out of the loop  —   where the human releases the machine to perform a task and that's it  —   no supervision, no recall, no stop function. The debate happening at the UN is which of these to preemptively ban, if any at all. Wareham, the advocacy director of the Human Rights Watch arms division, is the coordinator of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, a coalition of 61 international NGOs, 12 of which had sent delegations to the CCW. Unlike drones, which entered the battlefield as surveillance technology and were weaponized later, the campaign is trying to ban LAWS before they happen. Wareham is the group's cruise director  —   moderating morning strategy meetings, writing memos, getting everyone to the right room at the right time, handling the press, and sending tweets from the @BanKillerRobots account. This year was the big one. The CCW was going to decide whether to go to the next level, to establish a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) which would then decide whether or not to draft a treaty. If they didn't move forward, the campaign was threatening to take the process “outside” —   to another forum, like the UN Human Rights Council or an   treaty written elsewhere. “Who gets an opportunity to work to try and prevent a disaster from happening before it happens? Because we can all see where this is going,” Wareham told me. “I know that this is a finite campaign  —   the world's going to change, very quickly, very soon, and we need to be ready for that. ” That morning, countries delivered statements on their positions. Algeria and Costa Rica announced their support for a ban. Wareham excitedly added them to what she and other campaigners refer to as “The List,” which includes Pakistan, Egypt, Cuba, Ecuador, Bolivia, Ghana, Palestine, Zimbabwe, and the Holy See  —   countries that probably don't have the technology to develop LAWS to begin with. All eyes were on Russia, which had given a vague statement suggesting they weren't interested. “They always leave us guessing,” Wareham told me when we broke for lunch, reminding me only one country needs to disagree to stall consensus. The cafe outside the assembly room looked out on the UN's verdant grounds. You could see placid Lake Geneva and the Alps in the distance. In the afternoon, country delegates settled into their seats to take notes or doze with their eyes open as experts flashed presentation slides. The two back rows were filled with civil society, many of whom were part of the campaign. During the QA, the representative from China, who is known for being somewhat of an oratorical wildcard, went on a lengthy ramble about artificial intelligence. Midway through, the room erupted in nervous laughter and Erin Hunt, program coordinator from Mines Action Canada, fired off a tweet: “And now the panel was asked if they are smarter than Stephen Hawking. Quite the afternoon at #CCWUN. ” (Over the next five days, Hunt would begin illustrating her tweets with GIFs of eye rolls, prancing puppies, and facepalms.) A few seats away, Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University in the UK, fidgeted waiting for his turn at the microphone. The founder of ICRAC, the International Committee for Robot Arms Control (pronounced  ) plays the part of the campaign's brilliant,   professor. With a bushy long white ponytail, he dresses in all black and is perpetually late or misplacing a crucial item  —   his cell phone or his jacket. In the row over, Jody Williams, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 for her work banning landmines, barely suppressed her irritation. Williams is the campaign's straight shooter  —   her favorite story is one in which she grabbed an American colonel around the throat for talking bullshit during a landmine cocktail reception. “If everyone spoke like I do, it would end up having a fist fight,” she said. Even the usually tactful Wareham stopped tweeting. “I didn't want to get too rude or angry. I don't think that helps especially when half the diplomats in that room are following the Twitter account,” she explained later and laughed. But passionate as they all were, could this group of devotees change the course of humanity? Or was this like the campaign against climate change  —   just sit back and watch the water levels rise while shaking your head in dismay? How do you take on a revolution in warfare? Why would any country actually ban a weapon they are convinced can win them a war? And maybe most urgently: With so many things plainly in front of us to be fearful of, how do you convince the world  —   quickly, because these things are already here  —   to be extra afraid of something we can't see for ourselves, all the while knowing that if you fail, machines could kill us all? One of the very real problems with attempting to preemptively ban LAWS is that they kind of already exist. Many countries have defensive systems with autonomous modes that can select and attack targets without human intervention  —   they recognize incoming fire and act to neutralize it. In most cases, humans can override the system, but they are designed for situations where things are happening too quickly for a human to actually veto the machine. The US has the Patriot air defense system to shoot down incoming missiles, aircraft, or drones, as well as the Aegis, the Navy's own   system on the high seas. Members of the campaign told me they do not have a problem with defensive weapons. The issue is offensive systems in part because they may target people  —   but the distinction is murky. For example, there's South Korea's   an autonomous stationary robot set up along the border of the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea that can kill those attempting to flee. The black swiveling box is armed with a 5.  machine gun and   grenade launcher. South Korea says the robot sends the signal back to the operator to fire, so there is a person behind every decision to use force, but there are many reports the robot has an automatic mode. Which mode is on at any given time? Who knows. Meanwhile, offensive systems already exist, too: Take Israel's Harpy and   Harop, which enter an area, hunt for enemy radar, and kamikaze into it, regardless of where they are set up. The Harpy is fully autonomous the Harop has a human on the loop mode. The campaign refers to these as “precursor weapons,” but that distinction is hazy on purpose  —   countries like the US didn't want to risk even mentioning existing technology (drones) so in order to have a conversation at the UN, everything that is already on the ground doesn't count. Militaries want LAWS for a variety of reasons  —   they're cheaper than training personnel. There's the added benefit of force multiplication and projection. Without humans, weapons can be sent to more dangerous areas without considering   casualties. Autonomous target selection allows for faster engagement and the weapon can go where the enemy can jam communications systems. Israel openly intends to move toward full autonomy as quickly as possible. Russia and China have also expressed little interest in a ban. The US is only a little less blunt. In 2012, the Department of Defense issued Directive 3000. 09, which says that LAWS will be designed to allow commanders and operators to exercise “appropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force. ” What “appropriate” really means, how much judgment, and in which part of the operation, the US has not defined. In January 2015, the DoD announced the Third Offset strategy. Since everyone has nuclear weapons and   precision weapons, Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work suggested emphasizing technology was the only way to keep America safe. With the DoD's blessing, the US military is racing ahead. Defense contractor Northrop Grumman's   is the first autonomous     aircraft. Currently in demos, it looks like something from Independence Day: The curved, grey winged pod takes off from a carrier ship, flies a preprogrammed mission, and returns. Last year, the   autonomously refueled in the air. In theory, that means except for maintenance, an   executing missions would never have to land. At an event at the Atlantic Council in May, Work said the US wasn't developing the Terminator. “I think more in terms of Iron Man  —   the ability of a machine to assist a human, where the human is still in control in all matters, but the machine makes the human much more powerful and much more capable,” he said. This is called centaur fighting or human —  machine teaming. Among the lauded new technologies is swarms  —   weapons moving in large formations with one controller somewhere far away on the ground clicking computer keys. Think hundreds of small drones moving as one, like a lethal flock of birds that would put Hitchcock's to shame, or an armada of ships. The weapons communicate with each other to accomplish the mission, in what is called collaborative autonomy. This is already happening  —   two years ago, a small fleet of ships sailed down the James River. In July, the Office of Naval Research tested 30 drones flying together off a small ship at sea that were able to break out of formation, perform a mission, and then regroup. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) which brought us the internet, has long been the epicenter of military innovation, but these days, civilian spheres are the ones making rapid advances. In July, Defense Secretary Ash Carter launched the Defense Innovation   Boston office (DIUx) designed to woo civilian tech companies into collaborating with the DoD. It already has a branch in Silicon Valley. Secretary Carter emphasized DIUx is requesting $72 billion from the budget for research and development for the next year alone promotional materials say the money will be used for handheld drones designed to fly indoors that can operate autonomously and map the environment without needing GPS. They also want   technology that can sift through millions of social media posts for specific images and aggregate those posts for “rapid awareness of extremist activity on the internet. ” (DIUx denied requests for interviews, as did the DoD, the Navy, DARPA, and the Pentagon. The US Air Force, Northrop Grumman, and Boston Dynamics, as well as a bunch of DARPA's subcontracting labs did not respond to emailed interview requests.) Not to be left behind, the UK is developing the Taranis, a supersonic stealth drone like the   except  . China, though a black box of military development, has tested the Sharp Sword, their own stealth combat drone attempting to reach supersonic speeds, and there's word of an    fighter, the Dark Sword, or Anjian, but it is not known how far along in development these are. The Chinese also have showcased pixelated camouflage for tanks, which look like they've come straight out of Minecraft. Russia has the Armata   tank with an unmanned   turret that spins 360 degrees. It currently requires three crew members, but the company has said they are planning to go to zero in the next few years. They also want to build a fully robotized unit with artificial intelligence as soon as possible. Israel is already moving in that direction they developed the Guardium to patrol borders. “Guardium is based on a unique algorithmic expert system that functions as a ‘brain' to allow   capabilities,” Israel's Aerospace Industries declares on its website. All of this is troubling, no matter the country. “I'm worried about the US as a driver  —   not what they are going to do with it, but the perception of what they are doing, and then the perception of other states that they have to keep up,” Heather Roff, a research scientist at Arizona State University and fellow at the New America Foundation, told me. “You couple that perception and you get arms races, and you get bad actors getting their technologies, that they don't give a shit about targeting civilians. ” And it's not just an international threat there is a growing concern about the use of robots in policing and crowd control. In August 2015, North Dakota passed a bill allowing the police to equip their drones with Tasers or rubber bullets. In Texas, a company began exhibiting the CUPID, a fully autonomous quadcopter compliant with the state's Stand Your Ground law  —   if someone illegally enters your property, it will ask them to leave, and if they don't, it can tase them and keep tasing them until the authorities arrive. “People will not worry about this until something really happens,” Sharkey told me. “I have no doubt that there will be autonomous crowd control, if we let it happen. ” But a ban at the CCW would apply only to warfare. Although tear gas is banned from military use, many countries' police, including the US's, use it regularly on their own people. Sharkey was particularly concerned about the sales of a Skunk Riot Control Copter in South Africa. The octacopter can fire 20 bullets per second from four paintball barrels, “stopping any crowd in its tracks,” according to the company website. The Skunk can be armed with pepper spray,   balls, or solid plastic balls, carrying 4, 000 bullets and “blinding lasers. ” It has a thermal camera as well as speakers. Sharkey told me demand is so high he's tracked the opening of two new factories producing the Skunk selling to various security services around the world. With killer robots, you don't have to go occupy physically a state anymore  —   you could aerially occupy it with surveillance. You don't need boots on the ground. I worry that if you did have something like aerial occupation and mass surveillance  —   sensors everywhere, your movements always being tracked, your data always being tracked, everything you say being tracked. That to me seems very  . I don't want to walk into a dystopian future of mass surveillance and authoritarianism. That's what I worry about, mostly, with autonomous technologies, because everyone is going to get so scared. It's more incentives for more surveillance, more monitoring. Overreliance on technology invites interesting ways of adapting to it from an adversary's perspective. So think of IEDs: cheap, lethal,  . No one saw it coming. So I wonder in a situation like this, where you have AIs doing all sorts of different things, systems in the sea, systems in the sky, how do you fight that? I worry it will breed way more terrorist activities. You can call them insurgents, you can call them terrorists, I don't care, when you realize that you can't ever fight the state    anymore, if people are pissed off, they'll find a way to vent that frustration, and they will probably take it out on people who are defenseless. Because that's what we see happening now.  —   Heather Roff, research scientist at Arizona State University, fellow at the New America Foundation and senior research fellow at Oxford, On the second morning of the conference, Wareham and I were walking into the building when she mentioned an Israeli Harop hit a bus full of Armenians in   a mountainous region that has been contested between Azerbaijan and Armenia. According to experts, Israel has sold the kamikaze   drone to at least five countries. “We're not saying it's a killer robot,” Wareham made sure to say, but since it is a system that has an autonomous mode that normally targets radars, how did it hit a bus? What mode was it on? Could it be reverse engineered to look for targets other than radars? Nobody was sure. When Wareham heard about the attack the night before, she started to think about how to document it. “Then I thought, Fuck, man, I'm putting on my   hat. This is not good,” she told me. “The   is when you can explain what happened and document the harm. ” One of the problems with lobbying for preemptively banning a weapon was that there were no casualties for the campaign to point to, to spur public action. The successful Ban Landmines and Ban Cluster Munitions campaigns Wareham had worked on previously hosted many events to bring attention to victims, including building a pyramid of shoes in front of the UN and erecting the Broken Chair, an almost    sculpture of a chair missing a leg that still stands there today. “So you guys have your first victims?” I asked. “I don't know  …    ” She trailed off. “I think because we are so nervous about getting the process going, and they are so nervous about existing systems, that we've been  …     but now we will start to get a lot done and start pointing out the contradictions like that. But if you start off like that you can't get anywhere. ” And indeed, getting this far was hard enough  —   it took almost a decade for the world to take killer robots seriously. Back in 2007, Sharkey was at a press conference when a journalist asked him about military robots. He didn't know anything about them. Sharkey thought he'd have a quick look online one night and stayed transfixed for half a year reading military road maps. He learned the US wanted to build   killer robots and imbue them with AI. “I was shocked and horrified,” he told me. In his first editorial on the subject in The Guardian, he wrote: “A robot could not pinpoint a weapon without pinpointing the person using it or even discriminate between weapons and  . I can imagine a little girl being zapped because she points her ice cream at a robot to share. ” He began speaking publicly, but little happened. Two years later, Sharkey launched ICRAC along with two other academics. They made public speeches, gave presentations, and wrote  . Nothing happened. “We could not have the international discussion going at all,” Sharkey told me. It was a fringe group of nutty professors. In 2010, Williams, the Nobel laureate, was researching extrajudicial execution when she read experts saying that drones were the Ford Model T of where weapons were going. She stumbled into her kitchen where her husband, Stephen Goose, the arms director of Human Rights Watch (HRW) was sitting. “When I learned about killer robots it's like, what the fuck are human beings thinking?” she told me. Goose is Wareham's boss. He met Williams while she was working with Wareham on banning landmines, and the two subsequently got together. They began informal talks on starting a new coalition. Wareham began reaching out to experts and other NGOs. By 2012, a handful of civil society groups had woken up to the problem ICRAC had been talking about. Everyone was watching the impact of armed drones, but their progeny would be much more terrifying. Wareham went to Sheffield to meet Sharkey at home. They spent four hours talking. Wareham wanted to find out more about ICRAC and let them know HRW was planning to campaign against fully autonomous weapons. HRW started working on a report with Harvard Law School's International Human Rights Clinic called “Losing Humanity: The Case Against Killer Robots. ” In order to deal with the seeming contradiction of banning weapons that don't yet exist but kind of do  —   or the issue where humans can in theory override the machine but the system is operating at such high speeds and in such complex ways that it's pretty much impossible for that to have any value  —   the report came up with a concept called “meaningful human control,” in which humans would have ultimate authority over the critical functions of weapons, which includes selection and engagement of targets. What “meaningful” means is still nebulous, but for the campaign, that would at least satisfy the issue of an accountability gap  —   that someone could be tried and punished for war crimes, because there would be a chain of command. In April 2013, the campaign officially launched in London. Taking care to say they appreciate technology, they brought a friendly robot to Parliament Square who handed out bumper stickers to tourists and the media: STOP KILLER ROBOTS in black text, white background, STOP in red, and a bull' . But when they went public, plenty of people, including myself, laughed  —   they seemed insane. Wareham remembers the first NY Times story to quote them: “I was squished in the article between the tea party and Code Pink. It was like they were like, let's interview all of the radical people, and I was just kind of like, OK, you can put us there if you want. ” Comments like this are Wareham's speciality. She is full of positive energy, frenetically competent, always juggling 100 tasks. Things sometimes drop out of her hands  —   the strap of her overstuffed backpack slips, coffee vending machines malfunction in her presence (“Trust the machine!” she joked to me) bits of her sandwich fall out, and she interrupts a conversation to scramble for napkins to clean up. At the 2013 CCW meeting, putting LAWS on the agenda for the following year went to a vote. “That was ” Sharkey remembered. The docket could have been vetoed by any of the countries. Sharkey, who had never been part of a campaign and had never done any activism, was impressed. “Once those NGOs got into the bed with us, we were away,” he told me. Even the camaraderie of fellow activists was a boon. “There were times when I was blackly depressed, to be honest,” he told me. He had been on the road for years talking about killer robots, but talking, always talking, and feeling like he was banging his head against a wall, hearing the same things tossed back at him. “I can be talking to some kind of event in London and some person would say, ‘Well, it's just an unfortunate fact of war, children have always been victims of war and always will be.' And you think, Did you actually just say that, so glibly?“ The CCW first met to discuss LAWS in 2014. By many accounts, it was a circus. Delegates debated whether LAWS already exist, whether they will ever exist, and what they even were. (At this year's conference not much seemed to have changed, if you ask me, but I was assured it had.) The following year, more than a thousand AI researchers, including Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and Noam Chomsky signed an open letter calling for a ban. “Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has reached a point where the deployment of such systems is  —   practically if not legally  —   feasible within years, not decades, and the stakes are high: Autonomous weapons have been described as the third revolution in warfare, after gunpowder and nuclear arms,” the letter said. “If any major military power pushes ahead with AI weapon development, a global arms race is virtually inevitable. ” Wareham was delighted when she heard. She had never been to Silicon Valley. “You know that the movement is starting to take off when people start doing these things that you didn't know about,” she told me. “You're here at a moment in time  —   a snapshot  —   be excited! Be negative, too!” But it didn't seem so simple to me  —   once countries began developing LAWS, which they already have, what would really stop them from continuing? Especially if they perceived adversaries as doing the same. What terrified me most was that while we were talking about banning unicorns  —   something far away and magical that we have all the time in the world to debate  —   the technology kept careening. It had killed seven people that morning. If you had talked to me 10 years ago, I would say that's all science fiction, but I know better now. Take the US launching weapons like the   in big swarms at China. Add China's  . These are moving at supersonic speeds. It is an incontrovertible fact that when we have two programs and we don't know the content of them and they are competing against each other, no one knows what can happen. Sending a swarm of robots against China is one idea to imagine that China is not going to be doing the same, that's crazy. They are going to be sending them to California. If you want to be really scary, you can imagine people putting a nuclear deterrent on an unmanned system. It can go completely ballistic, I mean, who knows what can happen. That's the real danger. Accidental warfare has started before we even knew it started and a lot of people are lying dead. Yes, I do get nightmares about it. Really. ”  —   Noel Sharkey, founder of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control, The next day, Wareham and I were sitting outside of the auditorium assessing the current state of the conference. Mexico had come out in favor of a ban, bringing the total up to 12 countries. Wareham added them to The List. But between the UK saying they were interested in “intelligent partnership” and China volleying between citing the limits of AI telling the difference between “baby boys and baby girls” and also suggesting AI would save humanity, all while the Russian delegation smugly stalled on the need for definitions and the US suggested that autonomy in weapons would reduce civilian casualties, I was even more convinced the CCW was among the most ridiculous things I'd ever seen. The only thing keeping me tethered to sanity seemed to be Instagramming photos of the peacocks that freely roam the UN grounds. The head of the US delegation, Michael Meier, walked by us. “He walked out flashing a [Stop] Killer Robot sticker,” Wareham told me. I was dumbfounded. “Yeah, he's a nice guy, you know. ” Wareham was   when another member of the US delegation cut her off. “Hey, how are you?” the Defense Department representative asked awkwardly, in that way that officials often resemble actual robots. “I was hoping I could get a sticker?” “Oh, are they all gone?” Wareham asked. “They're on the table in there. ” Wareham turned back to me and started laughing. “You're giving out killer robot stickers and that's the Department of Defense representative saying, ‘I really want a sticker. '” She explained how the representative from Germany got them for his five teenagers, who slapped them on their doors as a kind of “Keep Out” sign. Another diplomat kept them on her office desk to show people. “That's honestly part of the reason why we did this, to get attention, to have a conversation starter,” Wareham said. No matter how many times Wareham patiently talked me through it, I still couldn't see how anything they were doing at the CCW would amount to anything. But members of the campaign believe, really seem to believe, in the power of advocacy in a way that feels like a distant memory of a better time  —   a time before September 11, before Guantánamo, before Snowden, before global jihad made any US foreign policy decision domestically publicly acceptable  —   something Wareham readily admits. Growing up at the tail end of the Cold War, anything seemed possible. Wareham remembers being on the streets of Wellington protesting nuclear weapons when she was 11. She and her friends would go downtown after class without telling their parents, joining massive marches against nuclear testing in French Polynesia and against US nuclear warships docking in New Zealand. In 1987, New Zealand passed national legislation that made the country a   zone. The US responded by cutting military ties, but the   status the US threatened never happened. “That's my background of activism  —   that it is possible to take a principled stance,” Wareham told me. “I thought that's the way the world worked. ” By the time Wareham was in university, the Berlin Wall was falling, there was Perestroika, and where there had been East and West Germany, there was now just Germany. Her textbooks could barely keep up with the pace of change. Wareham wrote her thesis on landmines. She joined the Ban Landmines campaign under the tutorship of Jody Williams. For her part, Williams won a Nobel Prize for her faith in the power of activism. When attempts to ban the use of landmines failed at the CCW, the Canadian government took up the cause and invited countries to Ottawa in December 1997 to sign a treaty opting in to ban the weapons 162 states are party to the treaty  —   the US, Russia, Israel, India, Pakistan, and China are not. By 2007, Williams and Wareham were working on the Ban Cluster Munitions campaign. The CCW failed again and they took the treaty process outside, this time to Oslo. They admit the campaigns have not eradicated either weapon, but they argue they have drastically have reduced their use and established an international norm. Yet something about LAWS feels different to me, somehow inevitable. “Nothing is inevitable, it is always a choice,” Williams told me. “We either choose to allow this to happen or we fight it. My choice is to fight it. I think we may not succeed but it's not inevitable. That's very different. ” For all their optimism, the campaigners are strategic, too. There are common tactics to every disarmament movement  —   a recipe that includes a champion country, victims, and a lot of team players. But two days into the meeting, there was no leader yet among the countries that called for a ban. “They're mostly developing countries and the Holy See,” Wareham told me. “What we need is a Western country. ” But none had heeded the call in fact, they seemed to be firmly against it. Wareham didn't seem deterred. She was enthusiastic about Mexico. “Mexico is the country that you want on your team when you are trying to create something, because they have been successfully involved in the creation of most of the humanitarian disarmament treaties that have come out of the last 20 years,” Wareham said. “They're a good team player. ” She gave part of the credit for Mexico's stance to Camilo Serna, a dapper campaigner from Seguridad Humana en América Latina y el Caribe in Colombia, who swirled around the hall, speaking with a different delegate each time I saw him. “As a campaign only, we are like a catalyst,” he told me. “Latin America is very progressive in disarmament. ” But for Wareham, it was his work that was helping push countries to communicate with their capitals, talking    and gaining the confidence of the diplomats to talk things through. “If we can build rapport and if they feel like they can talk to us, then maybe they will go back home and make the extra effort,” she said. Diplomats are people too. Another campaign tactic. Last year, Wareham brought a campaigner from the Middle East and North Africa, who she credits with bringing Egypt and Algeria on board. She couldn't afford to sponsor his trip this year. “We've got a big network of friends who want to help us with this, but what we lack is money,” Wareham told me. “There's so much stuff that we could be doing but we're not. But I keep saying to some governments, this thing is only going to get bigger the longer you take. ” The more time I spent at the CCW, the more concerned I became that regardless of the outcome of the meeting, it would be too late. The GGE would take another year or two. Even in the most ideal setting, treaty drafting would take another year. Then where would we be? I wasn't wrong. “We need to be quite concerned about the developments on the ground just outpacing what is happening at CCW to the point where it becomes an academic discussion, because it will become very hard to unwind once countries start committing large parts of their defense posture to the autonomous weapons,” Russell told me. While the campaign was talking about fully autonomous weapons, human —  machine teaming like the kind Work talked about was coming our way. If you combine facial recognition with targeted strikes, that would be   because the human does the targeting. “You can say it's morally inappropriate for other reasons but for the killer robot campaign, it's not autonomous,” Roff told me. “Now you see where the definitions get really fucked up. ” Roff explained it wouldn't take much to deploy loitering munitions with facial recognition. “We can do that now,” she said, all that was required was to be able to tap into sensor technology that could accurately see faces. “It's more a communication    link, cameras, surveillance, sensor fusion problem, which we are working on. ” “How much does that fall under the scope of whatever the campaign is even talking about?” I asked. “I don't think they know,” Roff told me. “Does the trigger have to be pulled and the bullet fired by the human? Or can the human make a series of selections that can be years, months, days ahead of time and then this thing goes and prosecutes, right? If that's true, then that type of configuration falls outside of the campaign. I think there is a big grey area that the campaign doesn't address. ” Think about that again: One of the things we may not even be talking about banning is a system that has been targeted to hunt a human for days, months, years  —   the situation on the ground can change, the tempo of war can change, a bridge that was once filled with tanks can be crammed with civilians in cars, and the weapon is still out there. This is what the campaign is referencing in the phrase “meaningful human control,” but there's no official definition. That's another campaign tactic: Make countries define things themselves. But why would any country define itself out of a weapon they think will change their national security calculation? The US is among the countries that have suggested they will be able to safely develop these weapons because they will undergo intensive review processes to ensure they comply with international law. For his part, Paul Scharre, a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security and   of US Directive 3000. 09 back when he was at the DoD, doesn't see the utility in debating a blanket preemptive ban. Scharre talks with the ease of a politician stumping and with   brown hair and a neatly trimmed beard, he almost looks the part. But when I sat down with him in the cafe outside the assembly room, even he had reservations on how all of this could work  —   including the campaign's idea of meaningful human control or his  's own appropriate human judgment. He ran me through a seemingly    example: Let's say we had a weapon that would target Osama bin Laden: The human operator sees bin Laden and he runs around a building, and you let the weapon go, like an attack dog  —   then you'd say the human was still in control. Take it a step back and say bin Laden runs into a building, and you tell the weapon to go into the building, but you don't know what's inside. What if he runs in and grabs a human shield? How big will the explosion be? What if someone else gets injured? Take it another step back: What if you know he's in the city and you tell the weapon to hunt him in the city? “It's not clear where this line is, right? ,” Scharre said. “At some point, I'm crossing some threshold where the person doesn't really know the specific context for the attack. Where it's kind of weird to say that the person's meaningfully involved, like they've just set up this process and then they went and got a sandwich, right? That line is really murky. ” This is the conversation Scharre wants countries to be having on an international level. “There's basically zero chance the CCW will pass a legally binding ban on autonomous weapons because every single state has to agree. It won't,” Scharre told me. But then what was the point? “In this world we are in, drones are proliferating like mad and we're seeing more autonomy baked into things like cars and house robots and everything else and you start to ask, how much autonomy do we want? I think it's worth countries coming together to, like, discuss it in an international context and try to see: Can we reach a common understanding of what right looks like?” So what does right look like? Even if humans can override the system to stop an attack, how likely is it that they will? It's well known that humans begin to defer to the machine it's called automation bias. Like when the squiggly red line appears under a word you type, even though you're pretty sure you're right about how it's spelled, you start to doubt yourself. You have faith in your spam filter, you stop checking it. “You just come to trust it. And if it goes wrong, it goes really wrong,” Sharkey told me. “Machines don't go wrong like humans do they go completely wrong. ” As the complexity of a system increases, it becomes harder to test its behavior in all possible conditions. As code grows, so do the number of elements that can malfunction or be coded incorrectly. With autonomous weapons, how do you even begin to know all of the possible things that can happen during the fog of war? How will these weapons ever actually be completely predictable to operate within the rules of armed conflict? When it comes to artificial intelligence and deep learning, testing has shown that neural networks misclassify images to a degree that makes no sense to humans. Relying on technology to identify enemies on sight could fall victim to the same shortfalls. Even more worrying, humans don't know why machines see these things  —   there's no way to preempt these mistakes. This makes it hard to predict how a system will malfunction or interpret the data humans feed it. What's worse, Scharre explained, in the case of an error, things could go badly wrong in multiple parts of the system as they interact with each other. Even with a human on the loop, the more complicated the system, the less likely the human will know where exactly the error is occurring. The longer the delay between the system malfunction and when the human figures out how to correct it, the more damage it can do. Then there is the potential for hacking or spoofing, which could send a weapons system back on itself. “You might think that you have strategic superiority and that could change in basically 30 seconds because someone has a software upgrade on their side,” Russell said. “Or perhaps someone hacked into your software and figured out what algorithms you are running and the area you will make a move in is predictable. ” The more technology changed, the more concerned even the campaign became. “It's the most important thing I ever worked on,” Sharkey told me. “I am more concerned than when I was at the start because there are so many new technologies that we cannot even predict. We are going to be here all the time getting bans on new things. ” At the end of the conference, Wareham and I were walking out through the UN grounds, a sea of flags fluttered in the wind  —   an idyllic setting to contrast the grim visions of our imminent future. The day before, Nicaragua and Chile had come on board, bringing the total number of countries calling for a ban to 14. After some furtive diplomatic stalling, the CCW decided to move into the next phase, the GGE, which would then decide if they were going to write a treaty, but the mandate was weak. On the sidelines, the campaigners had heard broad support for two years of GGE talks spanning six weeks. Wareham wasn't ecstatic, but she wasn't giving up on the CCW either. “Ultimately this is the process that we have got right now, so we have to stick with it,” she decided. “But if they can't agree to kind of step it up to the next level after this and begin negotiating, that's where we are going to have problems. ” We walked through the building's gleaming ornate white archways and through the lush green manicured entryway. In front of us, the Broken Chair statue loomed. I was still completely unconvinced anything I'd witnessed would mark the beginning of the end of a nightmare that has already started  —   between centaur fighting, autonomous weapons, lack of coherent definitions, attitudes of governments, and the CCW's meager rate of progress, what were the campaign's odds of saving the world from itself? The technology was already there, so was the will to use it, and every month brought new innovations that could never be rolled back. I asked Wareham what the campaign would do next. “What I have to do is to bring the robots to the UN,” she told me about the next big meeting in December, where countries will formally agree to move into the GGE and agree to the timeline for discussions. “We would probably do something cool with the future victims. We can have some shadows or something representing what might come or, you know? I am not sure. We will figure it out. ” Always thinking, always optimistic, Wareham was already onto the next task. “You have to have the visual element, the creative element, the diplomatic engagement, the research, the hard people like Jody [Williams] the soft people like Stephen [Goose] in a suit. It's a symbol  —   the whole cast of characters and get the ingredients right, get the timing right, build the confidence of the diplomats, make them think that you have got a massive movement behind you and get ready basically. Then everybody says go! And we negotiate and then we're done, like, 18 months later! Seriously, this is all just lining everything up for that time when everybody is ready!” Wareham turned to me and laughed. ●  "

"," For seven years before the murder, Dee Dee and Gypsy Rose Blancharde lived in a small pink bungalow on West Volunteer Way in Springfield, Missouri. Their neighbors liked them. “'Sweet' is the word I'd use,” a former friend of Dee Dee's told me not too long ago. Once you met them, people said, they were impossible to forget. Dee Dee was 48 years old, originally from Louisiana. She was a large,   person, which she reinforced by dressing in bright, cheerful colors. She had curly brown hair she liked to hold back with ribbons. People who knew her remember her as generous with her time and, when she could be, generous with money. She could make friends quickly and inspire deep devotion. She did not have a job, but instead served as a   caretaker for Gypsy Rose, her teenage daughter. Gypsy was a tiny thing, perhaps 5 feet tall as far as anyone could guess. She was confined to a wheelchair. Her round face was overwhelmed by a pair of owlish glasses. She was pale and skinny, and her teeth were crumbling and painful. She had a feeding tube. Sometimes Dee Dee had to drag an oxygen tank around with them, nasal cannula looped around Gypsy's small ears. Ask about her daughter's diagnoses, and Dee Dee would reel off a list as long as her arm: chromosomal defects, muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, severe asthma, sleep apnea, eye problems. It had always been this way, Dee Dee said, ever since Gypsy was a baby. She had spent time in neonatal intensive care. She had leukemia as a toddler. The endless health crises had taken a toll. Gypsy was friendly, talkative even, but her voice was high and childlike. Dee Dee would often remind people that her daughter had brain damage. She had to be homeschooled, because she'd never be able to keep up with other kids. Gypsy had the mind of a child of 7, Dee Dee said. It was important to remember that in dealing with her. She loved princess outfits and dressing up. She wore wigs and hats to cover her small head. A curly, blonde Cinderella number seems to have been her favorite. She's wearing it in so many photographs of herself with her mother. She was always with her mother. “We are a pair of shoes,” Gypsy once said. “Never good without the other. ” Their house, like everyone else's around them, had been built by Habitat for Humanity. It had amenities specially built for Gypsy: a ramp up to the front door, a Jacuzzi tub to help with “my muscles,” Gypsy told a local television station in 2008. Sometimes, on summer nights, Dee Dee would set up a projector to play a movie on the side of her house and the children of the neighborhood, whose parents usually couldn't afford to send them to a movie theater, came over for a treat. Dee Dee charged for concessions, but it was still cheaper than the local multiplex. The money was to go to Gypsy's treatments. Dee Dee became particularly close with some people across the way, a single mother named Amy Pinegar and her four children. Over years of tea and coffee, Dee Dee would tell Pinegar her life story. She was originally from a small town in Louisiana, she said, but she'd had to flee her abusive family with Gypsy. It was her own father, Gypsy's grandfather, who'd been the last straw he'd burned Gypsy with cigarettes. So she'd lit out from her hometown for good. She told Pinegar that Gypsy's father was a deadbeat, an alcoholic drug abuser who had mocked his daughter's disabilities, called the Special Olympics a “freak show. ” As Pinegar understood it, he'd never sent them a dime, not even when Dee Dee and Gypsy had lost everything in Hurricane Katrina. It was a blessing that a doctor at a rescue shelter had helped them get to the Ozarks. Sometimes, listening, Amy Pinegar found herself overwhelmed. “I wondered,” Pinegar told me over the phone last fall, “keeping this child alive  …     Is she that happy?” All she could do was be a good neighbor and pitch in when she could. She'd drive Dee Dee and Gypsy to the airport for their medical trips to Kansas City, bring them things from Sam's Club. Ultimately, they did seem happy. They went on charity trips to Disney World, met Miranda Lambert through the    Foundation. Looking back on it, Pinegar was sometimes even jealous of them. It was a perfect story for a human interest segment on the evening news: a family living through tragedy and disaster, managing to build a life for themselves in spite of so many obstacles. But the story wasn't over. One day last June, Dee Dee's Facebook account posted an update. “That bitch is dead,” it read. It was June 14, a hot Sunday afternoon that had driven a lot of people indoors to the blessings of  . The first few comments on the status are from friends expressing wild disbelief. Maybe the page had been hacked. Maybe someone should call. Does anyone know where they live? Should someone call the police, give them the address? As they debated it, a new comment from Dee Dee's account appeared on the status: “I fucken SLASHED THAT FAT PIG AND RAPED HER SWEET INNOCENT DAUGHTER  …    HER SCREAM WAS SOOOO FUCKEN LOUD LOL. ” Kim Blanchard, who lived nearby, was among the first to react. Though Kim had a similar last name to the Blanchardes, she wasn't a relative. She had met Dee Dee and Gypsy in 2009 at a science fiction and fantasy convention held in the Ozarks, where Gypsy could wear costumes and not be particularly out of place. “They were just perfect,” Kim said. “Here was this poor, sick child who was being taken care of by a wonderful, patient mother who only wanted to help everybody. ” Kim called Dee Dee's number, but there was no answer. Kim's husband, David, suggested that they drive on over to the house just to make sure everything was all right. When they arrived, a crowd of worried neighbors was already gathering. Dee Dee and Gypsy had sometimes been unreachable before, off on a medical trip without telling anyone. The windows had a protective film on them it was hard to see in. Knocking on the doors brought no response. But everyone found it suspicious that Dee Dee's new cube van, which could easily transport Gypsy around in her wheelchair, was parked in the driveway. Kim called 911. The police couldn't enter the house without a warrant, but didn't stop David from climbing through a window. Inside, he saw nothing amiss. All the lights had been turned off, and the   was on high. There were no signs of a robbery, or any struggle. All of Gypsy's wheelchairs were still in the house. It was frightening to think about how helpless she might be without them. The police began taking statements while they waited for a search warrant. Kim relayed information back to Facebook. Yes, they'd been to the house yes, the police had been called. Dee Dee's online friends and acquaintances began bombarding Kim with questions. She answered as best she could, but the status was beginning to get shared around Missouri. “Here's the thing guys  …    I know everyone is very concerned,” Kim wrote on Facebook. “We need to realize that whoever posted this can read all of this. ” The search warrant didn't come through until 10:45 that night. The police found Dee Dee's body in the bedroom. She'd been stabbed, and had been dead for several days. But there was no sign of Gypsy. The next day, Kim organized a vigil and a GoFundMe account to take care of Dee Dee's funeral expenses  —   and possibly Gypsy's. Everyone feared the worst. All her life, Gypsy had evoked protective responses in people. She was so small and looked so helpless. Many people couldn't understand why this had happened to her. Who could prey on someone who had no defenses? Meanwhile, the police were starting to sort things out. A young woman named Aleah Woodmansee had approached them. There were some things she knew, things that might be helpful. For example, she told them, Gypsy had a secret online boyfriend. Aleah was Amy Pinegar's daughter, a    who'd worked as a medical claims investigator. She felt like a big sister to Gypsy, and evidently Gypsy felt the same. But they were rarely alone together, as Gypsy's mother was constantly by her side. So when Gypsy confided in Aleah, it was through a secret Facebook account, under the name Emma Rose. “This is my personal account my mom is still overprotective so she don't, know about this account,” Gypsy wrote in October 2014. Then she confessed she'd met a man on a Christian singles site. She was in love with him, she told Aleah. Gypsy hadn't yet told her mother. She wrote that she knew Dee Dee wouldn't approve, that she wasn't allowed to date, though she longed to grow up and have a boyfriend like other girls her age. “In the past I told my mom something mean I says I wished ur mom was my mom instead of my mom cus mrs Amy let Aleah date anyone she wanted so that hurt my mom,” Gypsy wrote. The new boyfriend's name, Gypsy revealed, was Nicholas Godejohn. They'd been communicating for over two years. He didn't care that she was in a wheelchair. And Gypsy planned to marry him. They were both Catholic. They had agreed on names for their children. She was cooking up an elaborate plan for Dee Dee to casually meet Nick at the local movie theater, after which Gypsy was hoping they could be open about their relationship. This wasn't the first time Aleah had gotten clandestine messages from Gypsy about boys. She knew that Gypsy had tried to meet men online before, that in spite of what Dee Dee said about Gypsy's    mind, thoughts about romance and sex were taking root anyway. But she was concerned. Gypsy had always seemed naive to her. In October 2014, she wrote “I'm 18. Nick  …    is 24,” which made Godejohn six years older. Plus, the way she talked about the relationship was odd. “It was like some kind of magnificent fairy tale was unfolding,” Aleah said over coffee in Springfield last fall. She was worried, too, about Dee Dee, who'd confronted her in 2011 about her chats with Gypsy, telling her she was corrupting a child. “I'm not going to tell your mom about the things you said,” she told Aleah. “But I don't want you talking to Gypsy like that. ” Dee Dee took away Gypsy's phone and computer for a time. Gypsy had always managed, nonetheless, to slip through some crack in her mother's attention, find some other way of getting to Aleah. But the two saw each other less and less, and after the messages about Nick Godejohn in the fall of 2014, Aleah didn't hear from Gypsy again. Standing in front of the house half a year later with the crowd that had gathered, it occurred to Aleah that the police should know about all this. She showed them the Facebook messages, and they wrote the name down. The police also put a trace on the Facebook posts to Dee Dee's account. The IP address was registered to a Nicholas Godejohn in Big Bend, Wisconsin. On June 15, a team of officers in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, were dispatched to Godejohn's house. The standoff was brief. Nick quickly surrendered. Luckily enough, Gypsy was with him, unharmed, in excellent health. Relief flooded everyone, at least for a moment. “Things are not always as they appear,” the Springfield sheriff said at a press conference the next morning. It turned out that, in fact, Gypsy hadn't used a wheelchair from the moment she left her house a few days earlier. She didn't need one. She could walk just fine, there was nothing wrong with her muscles, and she had no medication or oxygen tank with her either. Her hair was short and spiky, but she wasn't bald  —   her head had simply been shaved, all her life, to make her appear ill. She was   if shaken by recent events. The disabled child she'd long been in the eyes of others was nowhere to be found. It was all a fraud, she told the police. All of it. Every last bit. Her mother had made her do it. “I just cried,” Aleah said, her sheer disbelief about everything that had happened overwhelming her. Kim Blanchard cried, too. “At that point it really became: ‘I don't know anything about this person. What have I been believing? How could I have been so stupid? '” “No one asked for any more documentation. No one raised an eyebrow,” Amy Pinegar told me later. “Were they behind closed doors laughing at us”  —   she paused for a second  —   “suckers?” Dee Dee's legal name was Clauddine Blanchard. She'd used various aliases and misspellings over the years: DeDe, Claudine, Deno. By the time she reached Missouri, she went by Clauddinnea and always added an “e” to her last name. Not all of her stories turned out to be false. She was, indeed, from Lafourche Parish, in the ball of Louisiana's foot. She had grown up in a town called Golden Meadow alongside five brothers and sisters, most still living. Her mother died in 1997, but her father is still alive. So is Rod Blanchard, Gypsy's father. He still lives in the area, in Cut Off, not far from Golden Meadow. Gypsy has his nose. He has a laconic manner, sometimes stoic, sometimes funny. He met Dee Dee when he was still in high school, and they dated for four to six months. He was 17 to her 24 when she became pregnant, and at the time the only logical thing he thought he could do was marry her. “I woke up on my birthday, on my 18th birthday, and realized I wasn't where I was supposed to be,” he told me recently. “I wasn't in love with her, really. I knew I got married for the wrong reasons. ” He left Dee Dee, and though she tried on more than one occasion to get him back, the marriage would not stick. Gypsy Rose was born shortly after the couple separated, on July 27, 1991. Rod said Dee Dee liked the name Gypsy, and he was a Guns N' Roses fan. As far as he knows, neither of them knew about Gypsy Rose Lee, the 1920s vaudeville child star turned stripper whose early life was the basis for the Broadway musical Gypsy. That Gypsy had a controlling stage mother too, one who lied about her daughter's age to make her seem younger, one who kept forcing her daughter to perform even though she didn't want to. Gypsy was healthy at birth, Rod said. But when she was 3 months old, Dee Dee became convinced that her baby had sleep apnea, that Gypsy would stop breathing in the night. It was then when Dee Dee began taking her to the hospital. As Rod remembers it, the doctors couldn't find anything, in spite of three rounds of tests and a sleep monitor. The conviction that Gypsy was a sickly child took hold. She explained the increasingly bewildering array of problems to Rod by saying that Gypsy had a chromosomal defect. Many of Gypsy's health issues, she claimed, stemmed from that one thing. It all spiraled so quickly. Dee Dee always had a new idea about what was wrong with Gypsy, a new doctor, a new drug. She had once worked as a nurse's aide she had a knack for remembering medical terminology and spitting it back. The information overload acted as a kind of wall around mother and daughter. It always seemed that Dee Dee had things under control. She knew so much, and she was never troubled by questions  —   she always had an answer. Rod eventually remarried and had two other children. He and his new wife, Kristy, saw Gypsy often over the first 10 years of her life, and can share pictures from various happy family outings right up until 2004. They remember going to the Special Olympics, too, but have good memories of it. “All smiles,” Kristy said. They have a picture of Gypsy grinning widely with her father and brother there. In all those years, Gypsy never said a word against her mother or anything else. Meanwhile, Dee Dee's relationship with her own family, never great to begin with, got worse. The cause isn't clear. (In spite of repeated attempts to contact her father, Claude Pitre, I was never able to speak to her family directly.) She'd begun to get in trouble with the law, usually for small misdemeanors, like writing bad checks. Eventually, Dee Dee simply moved away, to Slidell, two hours north and   to New Orleans across Lake Pontchartrain. Dee Dee and Gypsy spent their years in Slidell living in public housing and visiting doctors at the Tulane University Hospital  Clinic and the Children's Hospital. Dee Dee told doctors there that Gypsy had seizures every couple of months, so they put her on   medications. Dee Dee insisted to one doctor after another that her daughter had muscular dystrophy even after a muscle biopsy proved she didn't. There were problems with her eyes and ears, too, Dee Dee insisted, poor vision and frequent ear infections. Doctors dutifully operated on her. If Gypsy had a cold or cough, she was taken to the emergency room. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit Slidell. The power was off for weeks. The pair turned up in a   shelter in Covington, Louisiana, with pictures of their old apartment in rubble. She told the shelter staff she didn't have Gypsy's medical records with her because they'd been destroyed in the flood. One of the doctors at the shelter, Janet Jordan, was from the Ozarks. (She declined to be interviewed for this article.) She was charmed by Gypsy in the shelter: “When I first met her, I had to cry a little bit, and she goes, ‘It's okay, you're only human. '” Jordan told a local news station in 2005. It was, apparently, she who suggested the Blanchards move to Missouri. The story of a mother and disabled daughter left without anything proved irresistible to local press. It worked on charities, too. Dee Dee and Gypsy were airlifted to Missouri in September 2005, where they rented a house in Aurora. They lived there until the Habitat for Humanity house on West Volunteer Way in March 2008. While Gypsy had been involved with charities for children with disabilities from the time she was quite small  —   Dee Dee often stayed at Ronald McDonald houses  —   this was obviously the largest benefit Dee Dee had managed to arrange. It seemed to give her an appetite for more. While in Springfield, they'd benefit from free flights from a volunteer pilots organization, stays at a lodge for cancer patients, free trips to Disney World through various charity organizations. (None of the organizations with which the Blanchards had confirmed links returned requests for comment.) Dee Dee kept Rod updated on his daughter's whereabouts and medical circumstances. She did this even as she told doctors and new friends in Missouri that he was a drug addict who had abandoned his daughter. Meanwhile, Rod and Kristy spoke to Gypsy pretty often. They always planned to visit, but “for one reason or another, it would never work out,” Rod said. Rod continued to send, as he always had, $1, 200 a month in child support to a New Orleans bank account. He also sent the occasional gifts Dee Dee asked for, television sets, and a Nintendo Wii. He continued to send these things even after Gypsy turned 18, because Dee Dee said Gypsy still required   care. “There was never a question whether or not I was going to stop paying,” he said. There were, occasionally, small signs of deception. When Rod called Gypsy to talk on her 18th birthday, he said, he was excited to make all the jokes dads make to their daughters about becoming an adult. But Dee Dee intercepted the call, he said, to remind him that Gypsy didn't know her true age. “She thinks she's 14,” Dee Dee said. She asked that he not upset Gypsy by claiming otherwise. Rod heeded the instruction. “I think Dee Dee's problem was she started a web of lies, and there was no escaping after,” Rod said. “She got so wound up in it, it was like a tornado got started, and then once she was in so deep that there was no escaping. One lie had to cover another lie, had to cover another lie, and that was her way of life. ” They never saw all the local news stories about Dee Dee and Gypsy that had been written and filmed up in Missouri. They knew nothing of any charity drives and trips except what Dee Dee told them, which was very little. That all changed last June when Rod called Kristy, sobbing in the middle of a workday. Dee Dee's sister had called him Dee Dee was dead and Gypsy was missing. “I was in hysterics thinking she got brought somewhere and was left to die,” Kristy said. And if Gypsy was found, she continued, “how could I take care of her when Dee Dee knew everything on how to take care of her?” The first time Rod saw his daughter walk was in a news report on Gypsy's arraignment hearing in Wisconsin. No one had prepared them Kristy had spotted the video on Facebook. Rod was so confused when he saw it that he said his first reaction was, “I was really happy that she was walking. ” When Gypsy's attorney showed them Dee Dee's autopsy report, Kristy said she stared for a while at the portion about Dee Dee's brain. The lawyer asked her why. “I want to know what the hell was going through her mind,” Kristy said. “What is in that brain of hers that triggered all of this shit?” Dee Dee won't ever be able to answer anyone's questions. All there will be is Gypsy's story. And Gypsy doesn't know all of it herself. From the time she was arrested to my more recent talks with her in prison in Missouri, she is confused about details large and small. For example: When she was arrested, Gypsy told the police that she was 19. Rod and Kristy were able to straighten that out by giving authorities Gypsy's birth certificate. She was actually 23. Parents make your world, and Dee Dee made Gypsy's into one where she did, indeed, have cancer. Gypsy told me her mother said some of the medications were related to it. Even as she grew older, she wasn't sure how to question it. There are lingering questions, in fact, about exactly what medications Gypsy was given over the years. Some of them may never have been prescribed to Gypsy at all her attorney, for example, suspects Dee Dee gave Gypsy some kind of tranquilizer. The pile of bogus diagnoses, the confusing lists of drugs: It all points to a syndrome called Munchausen by proxy. Munchausen syndrome was first identified by a British psychiatrist named Richard Asher in 1951. A successor, Roy Meadow, identified Munchausen by proxy in 1977. It has been in the DSM, the diagnostic manual used by psychiatrists, since 1980. (In the latest version, the   it goes by the name “factitious disorder,” but for clarity's sake I'll stick to the Munchausen nomenclature.) In short, a person with the syndrome either feigns or induces physical and psychological symptoms for no obvious benefit other than attention and sympathy. If the person does this to themselves, it's plain Munchausen syndrome when the symptoms are feigned or induced in others, it's called Munchausen by proxy. The   recommends distinguishing Munchausen syndrome from what is called “malingering,” that is, faking or inducing symptoms of illness where there is some hope of material benefit. Malingering isn't considered to be a mental illness. It's just plain fraud. While most with the syndrome are mothers, there are also documented cases of fathers doing this to their children, husbands doing this to their wives, nieces doing this to their aunts. And doctors often don't detect it for months or years. In fact, it's difficult to say just how prevalent Munchausen is in the general population. By its very nature, it hides in plain sight. That doctors often miss Munchausen seems counterintuitive, but the   relationship is a bond of trust that goes both ways. “As health care providers,” said Caroline Burton, a doctor at the Mayo Clinic in Florida who's treated cases of Munchausen where the proxy is an adult, “we rely on what a patient tells us. ” Even if a doctor suspects his or her patient is lying, there isn't much incentive to refuse treatment based on the doubt. What if the doctor is wrong and the patient suffers for it? “You have to be careful not to overlook organic disease,” Burton said. “You've really gotta go through quite a lot of diagnostic hurdles. ” A diagnosis of Munchausen syndrome by proxy is attached to the perpetrator, not to the victim. Because Dee Dee is dead, it's impossible to diagnose her. She didn't leave behind a diary or some other documentation of her intentions. She did keep a binder of medical information in which she seemed to be sorting through the different information she'd given to various doctors. And she did fit certain parameters that doctors often cite as red flags for Munchausen syndrome: For example, she had some medical training. The number of doctors she took Gypsy to see over the years, and her propensity for changing locations so there was no clear medical trail, is also common. So are the concerns over sleep apnea, which is one way Munchausen often seems to begin in the various documented cases. It is also not unusual, as Burton told me, for extended family members  —   and even sometimes immediate ones  —   to be totally unaware of the feigning of illness. “The perpetrators are very intelligent people,” she said. “They know how to manipulate other people. ” They manipulate their victims, too, and the longer it goes on, the higher the chances are that the actual patient might collude with the perpetrator. The desire to please a parent can be enough to enlist a child in the deception. But even in adult cases, there can be some kind of emotional attachment keeping the patient in on the lie. “The relationship that develops between the two is so unhealthy,” Burton told me, of the adult cases she had treated. And no source I consulted had ever heard of a case where the abuse went on for this long, into their adulthood. One thing seems certain: For the patient in a Munchausen by proxy case, the truth becomes corroded. Gypsy's medical records are sobering. All the way back in 2001, doctors at Tulane University Hospital tested Gypsy for muscular dystrophy. Her tests came back negative. In fact, all scans of her brain and spine were relatively clear. The records of all those tests survived Katrina. Nonetheless, Dee Dee continued to insist to doctor after doctor in Louisiana and Missouri that Gypsy had muscular dystrophy. Most doctors appear from these records to have taken her assertion at face value and didn't probe. Instead they proceeded to treat Gypsy for various vision, hearing, sleep, and salivation problems that were presumed to flow from the muscular dystrophy. (The records I reviewed for this article appeared to cover only some of Gypsy's care. It's impossible to say how many other relevant records might exist.) Some interventions were surgical. Gypsy's eye muscles were repeatedly operated on for alleged weakness. Tubes were put in her ears for alleged ear infections. She was given a feeding tube and ate very little by mouth, surviving on cans of the meal replacement PediaSure well into her twenties. Her salivary glands were first injected with Botox, then removed because her mother complained that she drooled too much. Gypsy's teeth rotted out and had to be extracted, though whether that was because of poor dental hygiene or a mixture of medications and severe malnutrition, it's hard to say. The repeated invasions of Gypsy's body in the name of these illnesses she turned out not to have were, in short, serious and prolonged. It is difficult to say now whether any of it was medically needed at all. What is not difficult to say is that all of it began when Gypsy was impossibly young and could hardly have been expected to challenge authority figures  —   her mother or her doctors  —   about how she was feeling. For their part, doctors did not pick up on innumerable hints that Dee Dee's stories did not add up  —   not even the sleep doctor, Robert Beckerman, who saw Gypsy both in New Orleans and in Kansas City. Instead he featured his treatment of Gypsy in the hospital newsletter and mentioned repeatedly in the medical files that she and Dee Dee were his “favorite mother, daughter patient. ” (Beckerman did not reply to requests for comment for this story.) There was one exception. In 2007, a pediatric neurologist named Bernardo Flasterstein, consulting on the case in Springfield, became suspicious. In a recent phone conversation, Flasterstein told me he had his doubts from the first time he saw Dee Dee and Gypsy. Dee Dee's stories about Gypsy's myriad illnesses didn't fly with him. In his notes to Gypsy's primary care doctor after the first visit, he wrote, in bold, underlined type, “The mother is not a good historian. ” There was an “unusual distribution” to Gypsy's weakness for a muscular dystrophy patient, he wrote in his notes. Still, Flasterstein says, he gave the case the “benefit of the doubt” and sent Gypsy for all the usual tests, the MRIs and the blood work. It all came back normal. “I remember having her stand up,” he told me, “and she could hold her own weight!” He said he told Dee Dee, “I don't see any reason why she doesn't walk. ” In between his visits with Gypsy, Flasterstein tracked down a doctor who had seen Gypsy in New Orleans. That doctor told him that the muscle biopsy in New Orleans had been negative for muscular dystrophy, and that Gypsy's previous neurologist had explained that to Dee Dee. When confronted with the problem, Dee Dee simply stopped seeing those New Orleans doctors. “Analyzing all the facts, and after talking to her previous pediatrician,” Flasterstein wrote in the file, “there is a strong possibility of Munchausen by proxy, with maybe some underlying unknown etiology to explain for her symptoms. ” Dee Dee stopped seeing him after that visit. “I assume she got my notes,” Flasterstein says. He said nurses told him later that on the way out of his office on that last visit, Dee Dee was complaining that he didn't know what he was talking about. Flasterstein never followed up. He told me that in the network of Springfield doctors Dee Dee saw, “everyone bought their story. ” He remembers being told to treat the pair with “golden gloves. ” He says he thought that if he reported it to social services, they wouldn't believe him either. Thinking about it now, Flasterstein regrets not doing more. He says this was only the second case of Munchausen he'd seen in his   career. He heard about the murder when a former nurse in his office wrote him about it last year. “Poor Gypsy,” he told me. “She suffered all those years, and for no reason. ” He wishes he “could have been more aggressive. ” It was not the only missed opportunity for authorities to intervene. In the fall of 2009, someone made an anonymous call to the Springfield Police Department, asking for a wellness check. The person said that they had doubts that Gypsy was suffering from all the ailments her mother described. (Flasterstein says it was not he who made that call.) The police drove over to the house, but Dee Dee put their fears to rest. She told them that the reason she sometimes used inconsistent birth dates and spellings of her name was to hide from an abusive husband. No one called Rod Blanchard, or checked on these claims. The police accepted the explanation. Gypsy “does suffer from some type of mental handicap,” they wrote in their report. The file was closed. Gypsy also tried, once, to escape her mother. She met a man at the science fiction convention that Kim Blanchard and her husband also attended. Gypsy and this man began communicating online. At the time, in February 2011, Gypsy and Dee Dee were leaving everyone with the impression that she was 15. (She was actually 19.) According to Kim, the man in question was 35. He took Gypsy back to his hotel room. Through conventioneer intelligence  —   “We were all overprotective of her,” Kim Blanchard said  —   Dee Dee found them. She apparently knocked on the hotel room door with papers that showed Gypsy was a minor, and the man let Gypsy leave. (He could not be reached for comment.) After that incident, Dee Dee was furious to the point of public spectacle. She smashed the family computer with a hammer, cursed the internet to her friends. When she eventually replaced it, Gypsy was allowed to use the internet only with Dee Dee's supervision. And for months afterward, Kim Blanchard said, Gypsy was subdued, though “she wasn't acting any differently than a normal child who was in trouble at that point. ” The whole situation has left bystanders in Springfield with feelings of guilt. “I just wish she would have come to me,” Aleah Woodmansee told me. A lot of people feel that way. If Gypsy had, just once, stood up and walked across the room, the spell would have been broken. But plainly it wasn't that easy for her. In a way, that makes sense. She slipped, as people are fond of saying, through just about everyone's cracks. She had no reason to believe that her life would change. Until, apparently, she met Nick Godejohn. Under other circumstances, a tale of child abuse as long and as involved as what Gypsy experienced might have inspired public sympathy. But something about the fraud element deeply offended people, particularly those who hadn't known Gypsy or Dee Dee at all. Evidently there are a lot of people who are worried that others who are sick and disabled don't deserve their generosity. So Facebook groups began to spring up. They splintered on whether Gypsy could be said to be blamed, whether Rod and Kristy were in some way in on the fraud. Some groups ballooned to over 10, 000 members, some of them posting every day about the crime, voicing unfounded theories about what had happened. If their speculation had been confined to private forums, it might have been one thing. But more than a few of these amateur detectives were not satisfied with online discussion. They wanted to affect the case in real time. A St. Louis —  based Thought Catalog writer named Meagan Pack was keeping track of “tips” she'd gotten from Facebook about Gypsy and Dee Dee's crimes and posting them to a   post. Pack told me she called the police detective to inform him of all she'd learned. Random observers on Facebook also called the police with their various speculations. Then, when the court hearings began, they came to those, too. One even showed up to Dee Dee's house when the initial “That bitch is dead” Facebook post went viral in Springfield. She hadn't known Gypsy or Dee Dee at all. She was shooed away from the crime scene by the neighbors and the police. The result was informational chaos. Kim Blanchard's GoFundMe became a flashpoint for online sleuths. When Dee Dee's financial fraud was revealed by the sheriff, Kim shut it down, but not before the groups had taken it upon themselves to investigate Kim herself. Several thought Kim and David Blanchard were lying about their involvement with Gypsy and Dee Dee, and assumed they were relatives because of their last name. Kristy Blanchard, meanwhile, was still gathering a lot of the news about her stepdaughter from Facebook. That's when she discovered that many thought she and Rod were in on Dee Dee's plans. Others thought Rod must have been a neglectful father who didn't financially support his own child. “They don't understand that I've always been supportive,” he said. “In every way,” Kristy chimed in. In fact, if anything, Dee Dee may have had so much money  —   Gypsy and Nick had escaped with about $4, 000 from Dee Dee's safe  —   because they were receiving his support checks. (Dee Dee died intestate, without a will, and apparently without meaningful assets other than that cash.) Kristy tried, at first, to defend herself and Rod to these groups, but it turned out they were hard to convince. “It was hell,” she said. She withdrew from all the groups and asked friends and family to stop accepting new friend requests, which were pouring in. The neighbors in Springfield also had this problem. “It was like, ‘Forget you! '” Amy Pinegar said of the few attempts she made to correct the online sleuths on their factual errors. The obsessives ended up piling confusion onto the already confusing situation Dee Dee had created. And they proved quite resilient. At the hearing I attended in September 2015, two people from the largest Facebook group were there. After the hearing, they made a beeline for the local television crew and started talking to them. Gypsy's attorney, Michael Stanfield, saw them too, and tried to hurry out of the courtroom to confront them. “Who were those people?” he asked the television crew. “What did they say?” For a while, it seemed like Gypsy's case would, eventually, go to trial. The prosecutor declined to go for the death penalty, but both Gypsy and Nick were charged with   murder. As the investigation into the crime continued, it turned up text messages between the two that appeared to discuss and plan Dee Dee's death. “Honey, you forget I am ruthless, and my hatred of her will force her to die,” Godejohn texted Gypsy. “It's my evil side doing it. He won't mess up, because he enjoys killing. ” Prosecutors also said they found social media evidence of Gypsy directly asking Godejohn to kill her mother, though these have never been made public. Documents from pretrial discovery show him telling a friend about Gypsy's desire to murder her mother as early as May 2014. Godejohn referred to his “evil side” because he and Gypsy had constructed an elaborate online fantasy life, mostly through a jigsaw puzzle of Facebook accounts. They were into BDSM imagery. They had specific names and roles for each other. They took pictures of themselves in costumes, Gypsy dressing up at one point as the comic book character Harley Quinn, posing with a knife. Reality and fantasy blended quite a lot, for both of them. Even now, it's not clear why Godejohn participated in this scheme. He had no history of violence. (Reached by telephone, Godejohn's attorney Andrew Mead declined to comment on the case.) His only prior arrest was for lewd conduct in 2013 at a McDonald's, where he had been watching pornography on a tablet. But both he and Gypsy told police he was the one to wield the knife. She said that while her mother was being stabbed, she was in the other room, listening. One of the taxi drivers who'd carted the pair around Springfield after the murder told interviewers they thought Gypsy was the ringleader. Gypsy's attorney, Michael Stanfield, is a public defender. In an average year, he told me, he handles over 270 individual cases. He drew Gypsy's case at random and had no idea what he was in for. “I think this is probably the most complicated case I'll ever get,” he said. The Greene County public defender's office was somewhat lucky, in that they were also able to pull a former leading public defender, Clate Baker, out of retirement for the case. Stanfield also had an investigator and a paralegal working on it. Kristy and Rod had no money to hire a private attorney, though they told me repeatedly as I reported this story that they would never have told Gypsy to switch attorneys because they found Stanfield so capable and reassuring. The process of figuring out what had happened was, in a word, complex. Stanfield went down to Louisiana and dredged up some elements of Dee Dee's past. It took him months to get Gypsy's own medical records, because Dee Dee had set up a power of attorney over Gypsy's medical decisions after Gypsy turned 18. The hospitals refused to help, even though the power of attorney did not surrender Gypsy's rights to look at her own medical documents. When the records finally arrived, though, they were so damning, Stanfield called the prosecutor without needing to investigate further. A plea deal was worked out. On July 5, Gypsy pleaded guilty to   murder. The judge gave her the minimum sentence: 10 years. With the year she's served, she'll be eligible for parole in about seven and a half years, at the end of 2023. By then she will be 32 years old. For his part, Godejohn is still scheduled for trial in November. It was not, Stanfield told me, a listed condition of Gypsy's plea bargain that she testify against him. At a recent hearing in   he looked bewildered and lost, a beard concealing most of his face. His family never seems to come to hearings. Gypsy is now an inmate being processed at the Women's Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Vandalia, Missouri. Her hair is long, her skin clear and healthy, and she wears proper adult glasses. She's off all her medications, and there have been no health problems in the year she's been out of her mother's control. “Most of my clients lose weight in prison,” Stanfield pointed out, because the food is so bad. Gypsy gained 14 pounds in the 12 months she spent in Greene County Jail before her plea. Kim Blanchard, who visited Gypsy once in jail, told me, “She looked much more like the person that she was, which was the complete opposite of the person that I knew, and it was like she had a costume on that whole time and then took it off. ” But obviously, there are lingering effects. When I last checked her inmate record, it still had her last name misspelled, bearing the extra “e” that her mother somehow thought was a good disguise. In the Greene County Jail, Gypsy had a therapist she saw once a week. It remains to be seen if she'll have one in her new home, or if that therapist will be trained to attend to the specifics of her unique situation. Rod and Kristy saw Gypsy not too long after the plea bargain. It has been a relief to know what's going to happen to her. They don't know if they're going to sue the hospitals or doctors that Gypsy saw all her life. They'll decide that after everything has settled down, after they can properly talk to Gypsy. While the case was pending, they never discussed the crime with her the prosecutor forbade it. Now there will be more to talk about. They're hoping to get up to her new facility two or three times a year. It's a long drive, and there's still the matter of money. Months ago, Rod and Kristy told me they still catch Gypsy in small lies about her life, things she's clearly afraid to be frank with them about. It worries them. “Of course we want her to get better about that,” Kristy said. When I spoke to them more recently, Rod's voice was sagging a little. He sounded older. He said he'd started to wonder what exactly Dee Dee had told Gypsy about him all those years. He had only begun to pose those questions. He was wondering lately, he said, how Dee Dee had managed to be so friendly on the phone all those years if she hated him so much. He asked Gypsy about it. “She said, ‘Keep your enemies close,'” Gypsy told him. For most of the year I spent reporting this article, the case was pending and I wasn't able to speak to Gypsy herself. After the plea deal, that changed. I sent her a note. She called me from prison in Missouri to talk in short conversations broken up over a few days. Her voice is still   though now that we know what we know, it no longer seems unusually high at all. People heard what they wanted to. Gypsy speaks in long, beautiful sentences. She is sometimes so eloquent in conversation that it is hard to believe anyone could have ever spoken with her and thought her “slow,” as some put it. It reminded me of all the doctors who wrote in her files that in spite of Gypsy's alleged cognitive defect, she had a “rich vocabulary. ” She was eager to talk, barely able to contain herself once she started. She wants people to know, she said, that this wasn't a situation where a girl killed her mom to be with her boyfriend. This was a situation, she said, of a girl trying to escape abuse. In prison she's hoping to join all sorts of programs, to help people. She wants to write a book to help others in her situation. I asked her what I'd long been waiting to ask her: When did she realize her life was different, that there was something wrong? “Whenever I was 19,” she said. She meant the time when she ran away with the man at the convention in 2011. When her mother came to take her back, she began to wonder why she wasn't allowed to be alone, to have friends. About her mother, her opinion seems to waver. “The doctors thought that she was so devoted and caring,” Gypsy said. “I think she would have been the perfect mom for someone that actually was sick. But I'm not sick. There's that big, big difference. ” Gypsy still doesn't feel she actively deceived anyone. “I feel like I was just as used as everybody else,” she said. “She used me as a pawn. I was in the dark about it. The only thing I knew was that I could walk, and that I could eat. As for everything else  …     Well, she'd shave my hair off. And she'd say, ‘It's gonna fall out anyway, so let's keep it nice and neat! '” Gypsy said her mother told her she had cancer, too, and would tell her that her medication was cancer medication. She just accepted it. As for a childlike demeanor, Gypsy grew defensive when I asked her about it. “It's not my fault. I can't help it. This is my voice. ” Often, it didn't occur to her to question any of it, and when it did, she worried about hurting her mother's feelings. It often seems to Gypsy, even now, that Dee Dee really thought she was sick. “I was afraid that we were gonna get in trouble,” Gypsy said. “The line between right and wrong  …    was kinda blurred, 'cause that's the way I was taught. I just grew up that way. ” “When I think about it now,” she added, “I wish I would have reached out to somebody and told somebody before I told Nick. ” She mostly used the internet late at night, when her mother was asleep. Nick, she said, was the first person who had offered her real protection. She believed him. Ultimately, after everything that happened, she said she thinks he has “anger issues. ” She repeatedly takes responsibility for the murder: “What I did was wrong. I'll have to live with it. ” But she said Nick is the one who took “a plot between us both” and “made it into action. ” Gypsy was the one who had the idea to post about the murder on Facebook, so that the police would come check on her mom. She recalled asking Nick, “Can we please just post something on Facebook, something alarming, that would make people call the police?” But she said he told her what to write. I asked, repeatedly: Are you angry? With your mom? With the doctors? She will admit only to frustration. “It makes me frustrated that none of the other doctors could see that I was perfectly healthy. That my legs were not skinny, like someone who was [really] paralyzed. That I can't  …     I don't need a feeding tube. Stuff like that. ” In jail, Gypsy had access to tablet computers. She looked up the definition of Munchausen, after hearing the word so often used to describe her situation. Her mother matched every symptom, she told me. Every once in a while, I'd get Gypsy explaining some element of her abuse in such detail that something in me would break. Once, feeling speechless but aware that the clock was ticking on her phone time, I blurted out, “I'm so sorry this happened to you. ” Gypsy immediately switched into the girl she was back in those   local news interviews. “It's okay. I mean, honestly, it's made me a stronger person, because I truly believe that everything happens for a reason. ” Even on the subject of her prison sentence, Gypsy is a model of radical acceptance. She's told people she feels freer in prison than she did when living with her mom. “This time is good for me,” she said to me. “I've been raised to do what my mother taught me to do. And those things aren't very good. ” “She taught me to lie, and I don't wanna lie. I want to be a good, honest person. ” ●   "
73592,110133, Trump Promises “There Will Be No Amnesty” In Immigration Speech,Buzzfeed News,Salvador Hernandez,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/salvadorhernandez/donald-trump-to-give-highly-anticipated-immigration-speech-i
","'Watch the full speech here:'] Trump unveiled his   immigration policy Wednesday night in a   speech, vowing to intensify the deportation of undocumented immigrants and build a wall along the southern border. “There will be no amnesty,” Trump said in Phoenix, outlining a   plan that focused on deportations, increasing manpower at the border, and tightening visa regulations. Trump rolled out the plan Wednesday at a rally in Phoenix, saying the US should take “our forgotten working people” into consideration. The speech came just hours after Trump met with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto south of the border, where the two said they had a direct and constructive talk about immigration and their contributions to both sides of the border. But Trump took on a different tone in his speech Wednesday night, linking crime and immigration and stating that his focus would be on criminal immigrants. “My first hour in office, those people are gone. You can call it whatever the hell you want, they're gone,” Trump said. “The crime will stop   they are going home. ” If his Democratic rival Clinton is elected, Trump warned the crowd, “the result will be millions of more illegal immigrants, thousands of more violent crimes and total chaos and lawlessness. ” He also suggested Clinton would be among the deportees. “Maybe they'll be able to deport her,” he said. The Republican nominee said previous attempts at an immigration overhaul in the US have failed because of   politicians and special interests. “When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, lower wages,” Trump said. “Immigration reform should mean something else entirely. ” Like he's done at previous rallies, Trump also listed crimes committed by undocumented immigrants in the US, and at the end of his speech invited the relatives of victims of immigrants in the country illegally. The speech had been   after the Republican indicated he might be open to “softening” his stance on immigration controls. He then later said he had not changed his mind on the strict proposals he promoted during his campaign. Instead, Trump said the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country would not be allowed to stay unless they returned to their country of origin and begin the process of entering legally. “Our message to the world will be this: You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the USA by illegally entering our country,” Trump said. “People will know that you can't just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized,” he said. “Those days are over. ” The policy introduced by Trump Wednesday night was based on a   plan, which he outlined as building a border wall, detaining and deporting anyone trying to illegally cross the border, deporting undocumented criminal immigrants, blocking funding of “sanctuary cities,” rolling back protections offered to the children of immigrants brought at a young age, and vetting people trying to come to the US. “It's going to be so tough, and if someone comes in that's fine, but they're going to be good,” Trump said. “Very few will slip through the cracks, hopefully none. ” Trump has previously said he would form a deportation task force to remove the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US. And a hallmark of his campaign has been his proposal to build a wall along the border and force Mexico to pay for it. After meeting with Peña Nieto on Wednesday, Trump said the two discussed the wall, but not the issue of who would pay for it. “We didn't discuss that,” Trump told reporters after the meeing. However, Peña Nieto tweeted that the issue was indeed discussed at the beginning of the   meeting, and that he told Trump Mexico would not pay for it. Trump's campaign then issued a statement saying the two men “hold two different views on this issue. ” Trump also adopted a different tone in Phoenix than he did after meeting with Peña Nieto, telling a rowdy crowd of supporters in Phoenix that Mexico would pay for the wall. “They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for the wall,” Trump said. Despite past suggestions that Trump might consider some sort of immigration policy that would address millions of people living in the US, Trump appeared to put an end to that speculation. “All energies of the federal government and legislative process must be focused on immigration security,” he said. “That is the only conversation we should be having at this time. ”   "

","'Read Abby's full impact statement' 'Read the second victim's impact statement'] Former Univ. of Minn. student Daniel   pleads guilty to multiple rapes. https:  .  A former University of Minnesota student was sentenced to more than six years in prison Tuesday after pleading guilty to raping two women during college parties on    weekends in 2014. Daniel   pleaded guilty to two counts of   criminal sexual conduct stemming for two sexual assaults  —   one which occurred in 2014 on Halloween in his fraternity's laundry room, and one that occurred a week later at his apartment. “It's a relief I can walk the world a bit more freely now,”  's second victim  —   who agreed to be identified by her first name, Abby  —   told BuzzFeed News Wednesday. “It's going to be a huge relief to be a person a again. ” In her impact statement, which she read in court, Abby detailed the night of the assault. She said her only plan that night was to go to a football tailgate party. During the event, she said   asked for her help getting more alcohol from his apartment. “I remember realizing once I walked into his apartment that there was no one else there, and the terror that quickly set in when I realized what he was about to do,” she said in her impact statement. “I begged to go back to my friends. He didn't listen. I squirmed away and tried to roll over, but he kept pulling my body back. Eventually, he allowed me to flip onto my stomach as he raped me. I remember thinking ‘just close your eyes and you can get out of here soon. '” Abby said he violently raped and choked her, shoving his arm down her throat. “I thought I was going to die,” she said in her statement. “I kind of hoped I was going to die. ” “I started truly physically struggling to get away,” she added. “Each time he grabbed me back down onto his bed, and said ‘no' when I begged him to go back to my friends. Then he announced that he was going to rape me a second time. He called it ‘sex,' but I knew that wasn't what this was. ” Abby said she suffered physical wounds serious enough that a nurse gasped when she went to the hospital. Abby told BuzzFeed News she wrote the impact statement a few weeks ago and felt confident standing up in court to read it, adding, “there was a lot of stuff that was left unsaid that I needed to say. ” “When it came time, though, I absolutely broke down,” she told BuzzFeed News. “I'm surprised I even got through. I could feel him looking at me while he was sitting behind me. ”   will be eligible for release after   of his   sentence and will be a lifetime registered sex offender. His attorney, Debbie Lang, told the courtroom that   has entered an inpatient sex offender treatment last May, according to the Star Tribune. “From there he flourished,” Lang said. “My client accepts responsibility. ” In a statement to BuzzFeed News on Wednesday, Lang said her client accepted responsibility “fully understanding what the consequences would be at sentencing. ” These are the first steps towards rehabilitation and insuring that this conduct will not occur again. He is truly remorseful for his actions. Dan, and his family, pray for healing for the women, their families, and everyone affected by this situation. In court,   reportedly said he was “deeply sorry. ” “No one should have to endure the trauma and harm I have caused you,” he said. “I have only begun to understand the impact I have had on you. ” Abby told BuzzFeed News she's happy   received some prison time but said the sentence still feels like “a slap on the wrist. ” “I wish we lived in a country where the sentence could be longer,” she said. “For what he did to me, nothing would feel long enough. ” She also said she does not believe   regrets his behavior. “I have no other words for him,” she said in her impact statement. “He knows what his actions were, and I have never seen any remorseful or apologetic behavior from him. ” Abby said the last two years have been devastating. She is now a senior at the University of Minnesota, but had to take some time off after the rape. “Going back to campus was difficult,” she said. “But I had to go back. I had to finish school.   it's the only school I can afford. There wasn't really any other option for me. ” On Wednesday, Abby came forward on Facebook in a lengthy post she said is difficult to share publicly. [The post, reviewed by BuzzFeed News, is only visible to her Facebook friends.] “I'm tired of having to stay quiet about what happened to me,” she wrote on Facebook. “I am not the one who needs to be ashamed. ” The other victim, who has not been identified, also read her impact statement in court and said   “did not impact my life. ” Rather, she said, “he completely uprooted and altered it. In one night I felt like my life wasn't mine anymore. ” “I am going to watch him walk out of this courtroom in handcuffs today and count it as a victory for all the daughters at the University of Minnesota,” she said in her statement. “A victory for women and daughters everywhere. I am proud that I had a part in putting him behind bars. ”   "

"," WASHINGTON  —   Near Capitol Hill, staffers for Breitbart News, the   news site run by Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon, work out of a $2. 35 million townhouse frequently referred to as “the embassy. ” It's not a secret in Washington, but that home is owned by a foreigner: Moustafa   a man with a colorful history in Egyptian business and in politics as an   Brotherhood campaigner who has not shied away from publicity. How exactly Breitbart began renting from the home's Egyptian owner is unclear, but he owns the property, according to the D. C. Office of Tax and Revenue records. According to records, the recordation date for the property was Sept. 16, 2009. The facts of the house's ownership attracted notice in 2014 when an   blog posted about it. Over the years in Egypt,   has tried to institute the traditional jalabiya as national dress was among a delegation visiting Gaza and meeting with Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas' political wing and attempted to trigger a Ministry of Culture investigation into a book about the sexual life of the prophet Muhammad. Last year,   opposed a natural gas deal with Israel, saying he was against “normalization” with Israel.   a member of parliament, has gone through several political iterations. And for Breitbart, the relationship appears to be more than just a simple   agreement the site has repeatedly written about   without disclosing the relationship, often referring to him as a “senior Egyptian statesman. ” One former Breitbart staffer told BuzzFeed News that   does stay in the house sometimes. Other than on Breitbart,   hasn't appeared much in the US media. He gave an interview to Foreign Policy in the early days of the 2011 revolution that toppled dictator Hosni Mubarak in which he said his vision for Egypt after the revolution was to be more like Turkey and talked about relations with Israel: “The reality is that for the last 30 years there was no real peace with Israel. There was peace between Mubarak and them, but there was no peace between the nation of Egypt and the Israelis. ” He appears to have been visiting D. C. around the time of that interview, according to a NYer piece.   has discussed the situation in Egyptian media over the last few days  —   after a Guardian story drew attention to his ownership of the home  —   saying that he rented out the house because of tourism slowing in Egypt and that he has no connection to Trump. In one interview,   blamed the story on Qatar and the Muslim Brotherhood. “I am just a landlord,” he told another reporter.   who got his start in the tourism industry, first appeared on the Egyptian political scene in 2005, and was elected as an independent member of parliament. That year, the Muslim Brotherhood won 20% of the seats in parliament. “People were looking for alternatives to the authoritarian regime of Mubarak and to the Muslim Brotherhood, he appears as one of those alternatives,” Hudson Institute senior fellow and Egypt expert Samuel Tadros, who tweeted on Monday night that he was “not at all surprised” about  's involvement with Breitbart, said of this period.   won a seat in parliament in 2005 as an independent and later joined the liberal El Wafd party, serving until 2010. In 2010,   led an aid convoy of MPs to Gaza, where they were to meet with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, according to reports. In 2010,   lost his seat in parliament in elections just a few months before the revolution began in 2011. During this time he left Egypt for the USA, according to Tadros. Upon returning to Egypt,   joined a socialist party and backed the 2011 revolution. After winning   in the next round of elections,   joined the   Brotherhood National Salvation Front. In the most recent elections,   ran as part of the For the Love of Egypt list backed by Egypt's authoritarian president Abdel Fattah   who came to power in a military coup in 2013.   has also been involved with the   Parliament and has served as the second   in its Bureau representing North Africa. “He's a typical Egyptian politician,” Tadros said. “Outside of being against the Muslim Brotherhood there's not an ideological bone in the guy. ” Breitbart editor in chief Alex Marlow did not immediately respond to a request for comment neither did Bannon.

"," A political campaign has launched to support Judge Aaron Persky, whose decision to sentence former Stanford swimmer Brock Turner to six months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman sparked protests and a recall effort. Persky recently asked to be transferred from criminal cases to a position in civil court. The move was welcomed by his critics, but organizers seeking a recall said they continue to believe Persky is biased and should be removed from the bench. By Wednesday, a campaign had launched in support of Persky and his position. Retain Judge Persky has registered with California election officials, and Palo Alto Online reported that the judge had posted a list of attorneys who had donated in his courtroom to comply with the state judicial ethics code. In a statement on the Retain Judge Persky website, the judge offered some of his first comments on the Turner controversy. “I believe strongly in judicial independence,” Persky said. “I took an oath to uphold the Constitution, not to appease politicians or ideologues. When your own rights and property are at stake, you want the judge to make a fair and lawful decision, free from political influence. ” Persky and campaign organizers did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BuzzFeed News. The sentencing of Turner drew national attention in June after BuzzFeed News published a powerful letter written by the victim on how the crime had affected her. Though sentencing guidelines recommend a minimum sentence of two years for the crime, Persky ordered Turner to six months in jail because the teen appeared to show “genuine remorse. ” Turner is expected to be released Friday after serving half that time. Since then, advocacy groups have staged protests, and an online petition to remove Persky from the bench garnered more than 1 million signatures. A formal recall effort is underway, and scrutiny has come onto other cases where Persky has presided and delivered what critics call unusually lenient sentences. Persky has been a judge within the Santa Clara County Superior Court system for 12 years and previously served as a prosecutor. The campaign website also links to statements from retired superior court judges who support Persky, as well as a statement from the California Judges Association. Judges must work freely of fear from public opinion, the association said in its statement, first published in June. Persky is only one example of a judge who has experienced fierce criticism and even threats, the group said. “If a party believes a judge made a wrong decision, that party may appeal the decision,” the statement said. “It does harm to our constitutional system, however, to place judges in fear of recall or personal harm before making unpopular decisions that comply with the law. ”   "

","' Read BuzzFeed News' coverage here:'] The current vice president, Michel Temer, officially assumed the role as president at 4 p. m. local time.  But a second vote today leaned in favor of Rousseff, the nation's first female president. The senate decided   that she will be able to retain her political rights for the next eight years. Congress voted on May 12 to send Rousseff to trial. She was immediately suspended from office, and Vice President Michel Temer took her place while she awaited her days in court. Massive nationwide protests ensued. Several women clad in red  —   the official color of the Workers' Party  —   surrounded Rousseff while she spoke.  “The coup is misogynist. The coup is homophobic. The coup is racist,” she said over her supporters' chants of “Fora Temer,” which translates to “Out with Temer. ” She concluded her speech with lines from a poem by Russian Soviet poet Vladimir Mayakovsky: “We are not happy, of course, but what reason to we have to be sad? The sea of history is turbulent. ” Several members of Temer's party face corruption charges. He was found guilty of exceeding campaign finance limits for the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, the group with which he aligns himself.  As a result, Brazilian courts barred Temer from running for president when his term expires on Dec. 31, 2018. Temer, Renan e Lewandowski, no Senado, momentos antes da posse, Rousseff testified in court on Aug. 29, saying, “I am not fighting for my term in office, nor out of vanity or for power's sake. I am fighting for democracy. ” On the final day of her impeachment trial, Brazilian Chief Justice Ricardo Lewandowski decided that votes for Rousseff's impeachment and those to withdraw her political rights for eight years would be counted separately.  Then senators, both for and two against Rousseff's impeachment, took the floor.  Senator Ana Amélia, who supports impeachment, said that the trial was proving to the world that there was no coup d'état in Brazil, but rather they were exercising a constitutional process.  Rousseff supporter Lindbergh Farias called the trial “a farse,” and said “there wasn't a crime committed by Dilma. ” Farias added that even though the impeachment trial will end today, “it will last along decades in history. ” Vanessa Grazziotin countered Amélia's point, and appealed to others to vote against Rousseff's impeachment. “It's not an impeachment trial, but a coup,” Grazziotin said. “This Senate is condemning an innocent woman. Let's make justice, voting no. ”  "

"," A   man who said he allegedly wanted to kill Obama, bomb police stations, kill Homeland Security officials, and burn down a mosque was arrested by FBI agents Friday. FBI agents found parts for an   assault rifle, ammunition, magazines, and quantities of chemical material that “can be used to create explosives and incendiaries” at the home of Joseph Garguilo, 48, according to an affidavit filed in federal court. Federal agents also said they found handwritten notes at Garguilo's home “threatening violence against members of the Islamic religion,” according to the affidavit. Garguilo, who lives in Holliston, a town 30 miles southwest of Boston, appeared in federal court on Monday and was charged with being a “prohibited person in possession of ammunition”  —   allegedly in violation of a restraining order placed on Garguilo by his   in June, according to charging documents. In a press release on Monday, the US Attorney's Office in Massachusetts said the charges, if found guilty, carry “a sentence of no greater than 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250, 000,” but added that “actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. ” According to court documents, the FBI received a tip on July 27 about Garguilo from a woman, identified as Witness 1 in the affidavit, who claimed she was worried about Garguilo because he was “stockpiling food water and other weapons, to include tasers, mace guns, hunting knives and thermite,” a chemical compound that can be used to make explosives. Witness 1 told the FBI that Garguilo “hates gays, minorities, and the police” and that “he will plant bombs in police stations  …     and kill as many homeland security officers as he can before they kill him,” according to court documents. She also said that Garguilo believes the “structure of America will collapse” and “enter a state of martial law. ” The Boston Globe wrote that Witness 1 is Garguilo's   and has obtained restraining order against him on two occasions, in 2009 and again in June. Garguilo's attorney, Mark R. Meehan, told reporters outside the federal courthouse that “there's a long history of false allegations on behalf of the mother of his children,” insinuating that the allegations against Garguilo are related to “ongoing custody issues” involving the couple's children. Another individual, identified in the affidavit as Witness 2, claims to have been to Garguilo's home recently and has seen a “partially assembled   crossbow and knives,” and stated that Garguilo wants “to attack a mosque   kill Obama. ” Specifically, it is alleged that Garguilo said he should have killed Obama while on the golf course on a recent trip to Martha's Vineyard. Witness 2, who is described as a childhood friend, also recalled a conversation with Garguilo where he allegedly expressed a desire to “chain a mosque closed and burn it down” and “burn every motherfucker down in there. ” Witness 1 alleges that Garguilo has a history of drug use and might be using drugs again, while Witness 2 said they believed that Garguilo was using steroids because his muscle mass increased in a short period of time. Garguilo is being held without bail and is expected to appear in court on Sept. 7.  "
73600,110146, Supreme Court Denies North Carolina Request To Enforce Voting Restrictions This Fall,Buzzfeed News,Chris Geidner,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/supreme-court-denies-north-carolina-request-to-enforce-votin
"," WASHINGTON  —   The North Carolina voting restrictions struck down by a federal appeals court earlier this summer will remain off the books for November's election, following a Supreme Court order on Wednesday. The closely divided justices denied North Carolina Gov Pat McCrory's request to halt enforcement of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals decision striking down five voting restrictions while the state seeks Supreme Court review of the decision. Among the provisions in the law that the appeals court has ordered the state not to enforce are limits on the type of photo ID required for voting reductions to the amount of early voting in the state and elimination of   registration,    provisional voting, and preregistration that allowed   and    to indicate an intent to register when they turned 18. McCrory asked that the justices allow the state to enforce three of those provisions  —   the voter ID provision, the reduction in early voting, and the elimination of the preregistration  —   this election while seeking Supreme Court review of the 4th Circuit's ruling. The Obama administration and organizations that had sued the state over the law opposed the stay request. Justice Clarence Thomas would have granted the stay as to all three provisions. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito would have granted the stay as to all of the provisions except for the preregistration provision  —   which would have had little to no effect at this point on this year's eligible voters. In other words, as to the voter ID and early voting parts of the law, there was a   split on whether to grant McCrory's request and allow the state to enforce those provisions this fall. It takes a majority of the court to grant a stay, however, which meant that five justices would have needed to have voted for a stay in order for it to be granted. Notably, no justice provided a   “courtesy” fifth vote in support of the stay request  —   a move that Justice Stephen Breyer did take earlier this month when a the case of a transgender student presented the same scenario: four justices willing to vote for a stay, which is all that would be needed for the court to take the appeal when the cert petition is before the justices but not enough justices to grant a stay while that appeal is decided. In such circumstances, a justice can  —   as Breyer did in the earlier case  —   provide a “courtesy” fifth vote in order to allow for a stay while the cert petition can be considered. On Wednesday, however, none of the four other justices  —   Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan  —   did so, leaving the 4th Circuit's injunction against North Carolina's voting restrictions in place. In a statement, McCrory took aim at his opponent for the governorship, Attorney General Roy Cooper, along with the “four liberal justices” voting against McCrory's request. “North Carolina has been denied basic voting rights already granted to more than 30 other states to protect the integrity of one person, one vote through a   voter ID law,” McCrory said in the statement. “Even without any support from our state's attorney general, we were pleased that four justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts, agreed with this right while four liberal justices blocked North Carolina protections afforded by our sensible voter laws. ” 			North Carolina Gov Pat McCrory's request before the Supreme Court related only to three of the five provisions of the law at issue. This story initially stated that all five provisions were a part of his request.			   "

"," SAN MIGUEL DEL PUERTO, Mexico  —   Many Mexican children went back to school last week after a bloody summer that saw at least eight people killed and nearly a hundred injured as a    fight over a sweeping education overhaul turned violent. Thousands remained without classes to attend, their teachers still away on strike. A radical offshoot of the teachers union, the National Coordinator of Education Workers (CNTE) has been tussling with the government since 2012 in an effort to quash the reform, which seeks to get rid of   educators, all the while tearing apart towns and even families. The latest upheaval comes as the country begins implementing President Enrique Peña Nieto's education overhaul program, which introduced a   evaluation for hiring, promoting, and firing teachers. The evaluation system, which does away with the   practice of selling and inheriting teaching positions, is an outrage in the eyes of the CNTE. Lizbeth Santiago woke up just ahead of the school term three years ago, shortly before the reform was approved, to find herself caught up in the strife currently roiling the region, her life totally changed. When a group of frustrated parents in San Miguel del Puerto warned the   teachers not to go on a strike, they refused. So, the parents locked up the school and then hired new, but   teacher trainees to replace the CNTE teachers. As a result, the CNTE teachers no longer had a school to teach in when they returned from their protests, they instead set up a makeshift school in the home of one of the teachers. Since then, Santiago's hometown has been divided over which school they should be loyal to  —   the new makeshift school with union teachers who kept abandoning classes to organize strikes or the old school where parents took matters in their hands and hired   trainees who prioritize classrooms over protests. Most chose to keep their children in the old school, but some, like Santiago, opted for the new one. Almost overnight, her parents stopped talking to her, her neighbors started dodging her gaze, and her    daughter was no longer welcome at kids' gatherings. “This is like living in hell,” Santiago told BuzzFeed News. The schism that pummeled   relationships in this isolated, mountainside hamlet of 2, 500 people repeated itself across Oaxaca State over the last three years, putting on display the growing resentment toward the strikes by the CNTE, which ordered many schools closed even as the new school year began. And yet, the CNTE's tactics have worked, to some extent. Last week, education authorities announced that evaluations will, through the remainder of 2016, only be required for the 24, 000 teachers who performed poorly on last year's tests. The government planned to evaluate about 150, 000 of the country's 1. 4 million teachers during its first round of testing last year, though only about 134, 000 agreed to take the tests. The aggressive push by the CNTE to water down the reform has put the government on the defensive, with analysts warning that their protests will further diminish the governing party's popularity and harm its chances in the next elections. If you want to understand what's wrong with the education system in Mexico, you only have to look at Elba Esther Gordillo, who for decades was the face of Mexico's public education and the most powerful woman in the country  —   and now sits in jail. Gordillo's face is striking  —   her eyebrows shoot up in a deep V and her lips almost always appear frozen in an angry frown. Many in Mexico have compared her, in jest, to Chucky, the antagonist in the horror film Child's Play. Gordillo is also known for her voracious appetite for designer clothes and love of real estate: She is believed to have spent more than $2 million at Neiman Marcus, the upscale department store, and she owned several mansions in San Diego, California. According to an investigation by Nexos magazine, she traveled frequently in a private plane that flew nearly 430, 000 miles between 2005 and 2013. As the head of the teachers union, Gordillo ran the country's public schools and essentially controlled hiring. The union, with its 1. 2 million members, is the largest and most powerful in Latin America, and for years held de facto control over the Education Ministry. Gordillo at one point was so powerful that her support of one presidential candidate over another coulddetermine elections, as she could deliver hundreds of thousands of unionworkers' votes. Meanwhile, the quality of education in Mexico took a hit. In 2012, the Organisation for Economic   and Development revealed that more than half the students in the public education system could not pass basic competency tests in mathematics. Shortly after assuming office in 2013, Peña Nieto signed a sweeping education reform into law. It transferred power from the union to the federal government, established periodic evaluations for teachers, instituted workshops for educators, and allocated resources to improve infrastructure, especially in some of the poorest corners of the country. The reform spurred huge protests, with members of the CNTE attacking local government offices, temporarily closing down the main boulevard in Mexico City, and at one point blocking access to the airport. The teachers “come and talk to us about education, but what education are they talking about when our children turn the TV on and see the disasters they are creating on the street?” said Marisol, a mother and member of the Head of Families Committee in San Miguel del Puerto. One of the biggest sticking points for CNTE members, many of whom have not taken teaching courses in decades, is the periodic evaluation. They say it puts teachers from impoverished and isolated regions at a disadvantage. Some of the schools in these areas have limited access to electricity, take hours to reach on foot, and cater to indigenous communities who still communicate in their native language. Supporters of the reform say it was long overdue. The CNTE “is holding education hostage,” said Lizbeth Rodríguez, a teacher who accuses the group of placing its political interests before children's education. “It's delinquency,” she added. Rodríguez, who teaches at the original school in San Miguel del Puerto, had just finished college about 15 years ago when her friend, a physical education teacher at a public school in Oaxaca, told her he knew someone who could get her a job. His offer, however, came at a price: She could pay $150, 000 pesos or get a discount of $20, 000 if she had sex with him, Rodríguez remembers him saying. “I couldn't believe how far things had gone,” she said. What Rodríguez experienced was not uncommon, an employee at the Education Ministry, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to be identified admitting the embarrassing practice existed, confirmed to BuzzFeed News. Aspiring teachers could for years also rent or inherit their permanent positions at schools around the country. Teachers suspended classes on a whim, often because they wanted to attend protests. Shortly after lawmakers passed the reform, Gordillo was investigated and jailed on suspicion of embezzlement and tax fraud. When teachers returned to San Miguel del Puerto after a   protest in the winter of 2013, they found the school gates locked and a group of parents huddled at the entrance. The parents, who had warned them to reconsider their strike earlier in the year, started firing flares, a signal to call other parents for backup. Within minutes, dozens of parents came together to physically prevent the teachers from entering the school. Many parents said they felt more disrespected and disillusioned when the teachers left despite their pleas and warnings. Their children spent more time at home than in classrooms and the parents feared their sons and daughters were falling irreparably behind. “We've seen it with ourselves. I don't want my daughter to suffer like I have. I want her to better herself,” said Marisol. Weeks before the teachers returned, Marcial Vázquez, a father of two kids, convinced about 100 angry parents to hire new teacher trainees from nearby communities. They even decided to donate a few dollars a month to pay for the trainees' food and commute. Gabriela Canseco, one of the CNTE teachers, was shocked when she returned from the protest. They'd always had control over the town's schools and students  —   but not anymore. “I wanted to pack my bags and go,” Canseco said. But she decided not to give up. So she set up a school in her living room, where the bright blue walls are now covered with unintelligible pencil marks. Like evangelists, Vázquez and Canseco started going door to door, trying to convince undecided parents to send their children to their competing schools. Canseco reminded them that the CNTE school was the only officially recognized school in town and, therefore, the only one that offered students certification after they passed. Vázquez sought out twentysomethings like Santiago to teach at the old school. In a region with few real job opportunities  —   many of the men here have left for the US and those who stayed behind are subsistence farmers  —   the offer was tempting. Meanwhile, people slowly grew accustomed to passing neighbors on the quiet, undulating roads without exchanging a word. In the neighborhoods, they engaged in gossip about whose children had   school supplies and which school threw the best     parties. Soon, parents said children who attended rival schools began bullying each other. Kids who continued attending the original school warned each other not to speak with their friends at the new school. Parents too felt like they were being pulled in different directions. Monica Mijangos, who sends her three children to the old school, said she felt like “a weird animal” when she went to her godson's birthday party, where everyone ignored her because they were affiliated with the new school. Santiago refused Vázquez's offer to teach at the old school. She said she was appalled that he and other parents were willing to replace experienced teachers with unprepared teacher trainees. Parents at the old school have asked the Oaxaca teachers union, which has been more open to the reform than the national CNTE group, to send the town salaried teachers who have passed the evaluation as proposed in the reform. But none of the parents here, including Santiago, know what exactly the evaluation measures. And like most parents, she remains protective about her decision. “Everyone,” she said, “is free to do as they please with their kids. ”   "
73602,110149, Meet North Korea's Number One Fan In The United States,Buzzfeed News,Beimeng Fu,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/beimengfu/meet-north-koreas-number-one-fan-in-the-united-states
"," LOS ANGELES  —   The heart of Koreatown was still hot as night fell in early June. Inside a ballroom on the second floor of a   hotel, a white banner with Korean words revealed the night's theme: “Discussion between fellow countrymen in the U. S. on peace and unification. ” Ken Roh, 72, was wearing an old,   suit and a bright   tie, and stood greeting the three dozen people who drove from all over the city to see him, a veteran reporter who built his career defending one of the most secretive countries in the world: North Korea. The audience sat straight up, focused, eager to hear about what Roh had seen and heard during a recent    trip to the country and its neighboring areas in China  —   his 69th visit to the country officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It's become a tradition over the past decade  —   two to three times each year, the same group of   fans gather, eat Korean food, chat, and wait for the good news brought back firsthand from what they believe is the ideal society. On that June night, Roh started off by triumphantly displaying on a TV screen a Washington Post article that told the story of the two   sons of a former American GI who defected to North Korea in 1962. The article, which detailed their continued loyalty to North Korea, relied on a video of an interview that Roh had done with the two men while in North Korea and had uploaded to the YouTube channel of the news site he founded over a decade ago, Minjok Tongshin. Roh appeared in the video himself, and it has since garnered around 20, 000 views, making it his most watched video ever. He shared his pride with the crowd twice, once in Korean, and another in his    English, telling them he regarded the interview and its subsequent appearance in a huge national newspaper as his “number one good job” during the visit. The audience applauded. “It was a moving interview,” Roh said, as someone stood on a chair and took a photo of the room. While everyone else in the world sees North Korea as the home of gulags, starvation, and aggressive missile tests, the South Korean émigrés gathered in the ballroom see the country as a     motherland, even if, technically, it's still at war with South Korea despite an armistice signed in 1953. This is the pro —  North Korea community in the U. S. whose interests are at odds with the country they've made their home  —   on Wednesday, July 6, for the first time, the U. S. sanctioned North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for human rights abuses. From the outside, everything about the community, from how it emerged, to how far it is willing to carry its commitment to North Korea, is puzzling. Roh and his followers, listening intently to the gospel delivered straight from Pyongyang, offer a window into how North Korea's ideology spreads under the radar on U. S. soil, and, ultimately, just how people decide what to believe in. Roh's house sits along a main road in Glendale, surrounded by vibrant flowers like daylilies and blue jacarandas with an open view of the   Verdugo Mountains. It's nearly 6, 000 miles away from Gangneung, the northeastern coastal city in South Korea where Roh was born in 1944, when the Korean Peninsula was in its last years of Japanese colonial rule. The split that divided the two into a   north and U. S.  south was never meant to be permanent both countries on the Korean Peninsula want to see an end to the status quo, and talks about reunification has been on top of the agenda for decades. The horror of the Korean War  —   and the inability of North and South to decide what a rejoined government would look like  —   set the divide firmly into place. These days, the biggest obstacle the tens of thousands of divided families face, according to the Brookings Institute, is “North Korea itself. ” When Roh was young, though, the Cold War was still in full swing and neither side was particularly admirable. “As soon as I graduated [from South Korea's elite Yonsei University] I was trying to find a way to run away from the South Korean territory to pursue the freedom of expression,” Roh said, describing how publicly criticizing the government could lead to jailing under   Park Chung Hee. When Roh was still at school, however, he couldn't stay away from politics  —   as the    of the campus   newspaper, he once surveyed his classmates on how they felt about the government. (  percent responded negatively he said the school cut his scholarship afterward.) He became a student activist against the Park dictatorship, but saw no hope for democratization in South Korea and, after a few years saving up money, decided to come to the USA. It was 1973. “At that time I thought that USA was number one democratic country, number one social justice —  oriented country,” Roh said. But during his years at the University of Texas as an urban sociology student, he changed his mind. “I started to know what is jingoism, what is the civil rights movement in the U. S. A. ,” he said in his somewhat stilted English, pointing to the struggle of black Americans and racist laws targeting Chinese immigrants in the 18th century. “I didn't know before I came here. I started to open my consciousness [and] become critical,” he said. Even with the constant threat of renewed conflict, for a long time, Roh gave North Korea no thought, maintaining his focus on democratization in South Korea, where oppressive governments remained in power until the late 1980s through U. S. support as a counter to Pyongyang and communist China. “Just once in awhile [I thought to myself] Why divided?” he recalled. Upon completing his degree, he moved to L. A. and worked for a few local Korean community newspapers. After seeing his articles being thrown out, he says, he quit. North Korea caught Roh's attention for the first time in 1989, when he heard news that several   South Korean dissidents had taken unauthorized trips to Pyongyang as an unofficial way to promote reunification. The trips sparked a new wave of national turmoil in South Korea  —   the country was dealing with the aftermath of its drastic social transition from an authoritarian state to a democracy. For Roh, the idea of entering North Korea at all seemed like a revelation. The next year, he traveled to North Korea for the first time as an organizing member of a “  rally for reunification,” the first free border crossing agreed to by the two governments since their division in 1945. Until then, Roh said, he was under the influence of a “Western way of thinking” and thought Kim Il Sung, North Korea's first leader, was a dictator. But the visit, he said, changed everything. After the rally in Panmunjom, a village north of the 2.   demilitarized zone (DMZ) that separates the two countries and where the armistice that paused the Korean War was signed, 15 participants, including Roh and three other Korean émigrés, were unexpectedly whisked away and driven to a beautiful villa. Kim Il Sung walked out and greeted them personally they had been chosen to share a meal with the Great Leader. Roh remembered Kim's secretary saying, “This is the first time he came out in front of the house. Usually [he's] inside  —   this is unusual. ” “I was scared,” Roh said, “but he made us very comfortable. ” Roh recalled the moment when he began to sympathize with Kim, as the North Korean leader described how hard it was to establish the country, counting only “seven to eight intellectuals” among his leadership's ranks. By the end of the banquet, when a symbolic course of “black, rotten potatoes” like those that were the only thing available during World War II and the Korean War were served, Kim had won Roh over. “My feeling is [that] he's like a grandfather,” Roh said. “My grandfather. ” Roh's interest in North Korea continued once he got back to the U. S. Over the years, he collected the eight volumes of the elder Kim's memoir, With the Century, and memorized them by heart. He's a big believer in North Korea's official ideology, juche, Korean for “” also known as Kimilsungism. And he took a more active role promoting reunification the way he knew best, by writing. But this time he wanted his own publication. He couldn't afford to print a newspaper, but the younger brother of a friend, who was working as an internet developer at the time, offered him something he'd never thought of: a website. “Mr. Roh, why don't you operate internet news?” Roh said the young man asked him one day in 1998, when the internet wasn't yet a popular primary news source (the websites of the Los Angeles Times and the NY Times had launched just three years earlier). Minjok Tongshin, Korean for “National Communication,” debuted on Nov. 11, 1999. Today, Roh updates the site daily and manages nine other members of the editorial staff, all of whom are volunteers who get only symbolic salaries  —   no more than $100 a month each, former editorial staff member Rev. Joseph Paik confirmed in a phone interview. Roh says that the operating funds for the website all come from small offline donations from   throughout the country: Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Baltimore, D. C. and NY. People in South Korea sometimes send him money too, he said. “Of course many times [we have had a] shortage,” Roh said, but money, he says, has never been his top concern. Roh has maintained a series of side jobs, including selling encyclopedias, in which he brought his substantial persuasive abilities to bear, earning enough to buy property in Koreatown. The website's angle hits you right in the face  —   the U. S. is referred to as “imperialist America,” and calls South Korean President Park Geun Hye's government “oppressive. ” (Her father is Park Chung Hee, the former military dictator whose policies Roh spent the early part of his life protesting.) Meanwhile, it dwells on the good deeds of the “Supreme Leader” Kim Jong Un and cites articles from the Korean Central News Agency and other North Korean   media. South Korea blocked Minjok Tongshin in 2004. Roh considers it a success, claiming a monthly readership of 2 to 3 million, though a typical article gets only a few hundred views. (A review of traffic analytics websites shows that, in reality, Minjok Tongshin gets an average of about 20, 000 visits per month, whereas   community newspaper Korea Times gets about 1, 600, 000. After confronting Roh with the number, he insisted a conservative number of 1 million was accurate, if including social media and email subscribers  —   but the site has only about 1, 000 Twitter followers and 600 YouTube subscribers.) After that first visit, Roh continued to travel to Pyongyang every year, soon becoming a trustworthy comrade of the North Korean regime, gaining rare access to the country. He once shook hands with the country's current president Kim Jong Un, offering condolences for the death of Kim Jong Il, Kim's father and predecessor. He also claims that the Foreign Ministry is at his disposal to set up interviews upon request, as long as he submits a list of questions they deem appropriate. That's how he was able to reach the sons of the American who defected to North Korea, for the interview that landed him in the Post. He met their father, James Joseph Dresnok, years ago through an exchange of cigarettes, when the two English speakers were both hospitalized in Pyongyang Friendship Hospital. Roh wanted to meet with him during his latest visit, but officials told him Dresnok was too sick. Undeterred, he suggested to officials that he could at least catch up with his friend's sons. The government granted his request after reviewing the required list of questions. Roh's work on Minjok has won the heart of the North Korean government: In 2008, he got a Ph. D. in political science from Kim Il Sung University. In 2014, the government awarded him the Kim Il Sung Prize, which is “a very significant award to get from the DPRK,” Michael Madden, a visiting scholar at the U. S.  Institute, told BuzzFeed News. “Obviously something has been done to the attention to the supreme leadership of North Korea who usually signs off on the document authorizing the prize. ” The government treated Roh with a reception for the prize, which comes with a certificate and a   medallion. In the official certificate, he was addressed somewhat awkwardly as the “Representative of Korean American Internet Newspaper. ” Roh, who was in North Korea for one of his reporting trips, claimed he had no idea the award was coming: “They didn't tell me in advance and I only knew as a surprise. ” Roh's deep involvement and access has obviously raised some eyebrows. “I think he's funded and supported by North Korean government,” said Seoungmin Lee, a defector who is currently enrolled at Columbia University. “Just look at it, he's supporting North Korea and delivering the messages to the outside world  —   otherwise why would he do that. ” Roh admits that Minjok Tongshin is a pro —  North Korea organization, but denies that he's controlled by the North Korean government. “One hundred percent [of our funds come] from overseas   [including] even a small percent of funds from South Korea,” he said. Minjok Tongshin, however, is not the only organization in the USA that sympathetic toward North Korea. According to a list pulled together by Lawrence Peck, a researcher specializing in the U. S.  pro —  North Korea movement, there could be as many as 70 to 80 such groups, although many are composed of just one person. The major ones include NY —  based Nodutdol and Korean American National Coordinating Committee (KANCC) which organizes “reunion” tourist groups to North Korea and offers   orientations before the groups set off. “We tell them what we expect from them,” said Moon J. Pak, vice president of KANCC, who is in close contact with Roh and has written articles reposted on Minjok Tongshin. “Most Korean Americans think [North Korea] it's a dictator's country, that's not true, [we tell them] ‘you can take pictures with people on the street freely,' to assure them [that] they are not going to a dangerous place. ” The group also has its controversies: Last year, KANCC was forced to deny an accusation of U. S. tax violations published in   South Korean media. Moon denounced the accusation as an attempt to undermine his work, telling BuzzFeed News the office had never been investigated. Peck splits   groups into two categories: “front groups” and “open groups. ” The former appear neutral and address mainstream society  —   he listed Women Cross DMZ, the group of feminist activists who walked across the demilitarized zone intending to demonstrate peace last year, as an example. (The group has denied accusations that they were bolstering the Kim regime, including during a visit to Capitol Hill.) The latter set, like Minjok Tongshin, shows open support for Pyongyang. Peck monitors Roh's website and social media accounts closely. He often emails fellow   Korea activists about Roh's activities, and, “in some rare cases,” goes to monitor Roh's events from a distance to discover hidden members of front groups. Minjok Tongshin's community is well aware of him, he said, pointing to articles that have called him “pathetic. ” (During a   phone call, Roh angrily said he didn't want to talk about Peck and his accusations at all.) Members of these organizations are passionate, but it's unclear how far North Korean influence actually reaches. “I don't even know if there are such groups in our community,” said Chris Lee, the director of the dispute resolution center at Korean American Coalition (KAC) an organization based in L. A. “I know there are a lot of people supporting North Korea in LA, but we don't interact with them they have their own [opinion]. We don't have any relationship, period. ” In truth, the reunified Korea that Roh and his admirers are praying for ultimately is a   regime for Kim. Roh and his ilk's methods are nothing new: When the international community condemns North Korea for its human rights issues, North Korea points back at South Korea and the U. S. for their own human rights abuses. That Roh's video wound up in the Washington Post is a “brilliant North Korea propaganda piece,” said Greg Scarlatoiu, the executive director of the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea. The video, he said, neglected an important basic fact: The mother of the two sons, reportedly, was an abductee from Romania who eventually “died in North Korea, unable to return to her country. ” (A BBC documentary called Crossing the Line detailed the true story.) “The propaganda news [on Minjok Tongshin] is not 100% true, and those great things that happened did not happen to 99% of the North Korean population. A very big amount [of the population] is suffering,” said Grace Jo, a North Korean defector turned activist who goes to school in Maryland. Jo lost four of her family members to starvation and prison torture during the 1990s famine that killed as many as 3 million people by some estimates, before she escaped and spent her teenage years in China with her mother and her elder sister. “If a naïve student gets exposed to these articles [posted on Roh's website] they will consider North Korea to be good and praise the system,” said Jo. Roh has denied all accusations of propaganda and maintained that he only wrote about “truth” when confronted with his critics' views. While young people in South Korea worry about a chaotic future brought on by the potential reunification, for some   Koreans in the U. S. Roh's work on North Korea provides a happy illusion of an alternate life that they've never lived: simple, pure, with   access to housing, education, and medical treatment. Two new faces inside that L. A. ballroom were Deb Kim and Michael Kim, friends and business partners in their   who are not related. (Both asked that their photos not be used for fear of judgment from L. A.'s   community.) Over cheese rice cake and Korean rice wine at a restaurant called Saek Dong Juh Gori, one of many that serves that largest   population in the country, they spoke of their sympathy for North Korea. “I would definitely prefer to live in North Korea,” Michael said. “People are purer in North Korea, although they are poorer. But there's nothing bad about it. ” Michael was born and raised by Korean parents in the U. S. while Deb moved here with her family from the city of Gwangju when she was 7. Deb didn't know a lot about Roh or Minjok Tongshin before the meeting, but Michael has known Roh since last December. It's been a short time, but to Michael, who has spent many nights defending North Korea on Facebook and around the internet, Roh has already been a role model  —   Michael dreams of establishing an   website to bring North Korea news to mainstream society. Going public with his love for North Korea didn't come without a cost for Michael: his ties with his family. His mother thought he was being insane, said Michael, and he hasn't found much to talk about with most members of his extended family since. At home, Roh, aware of his advanced years, is also having a hard time finding someone to carry his torch. “Hey Daddy, your work is enough, one is enough for our family,” Roh recounts one of his two adult daughters saying. “My kids also have their own values  —   they are almost the American way of thinking,” Roh said with frustration, knowing that he wouldn't be able to convince even his family of the wonder of North Korea. They still respect the work he does since it's what he loves, and they comfort him when he gets depressed by the kinds of North Korea news he deems distorted, just like they did when they were little: “Daddy, one Korea yes, two Korea no!” He says they make him laugh.

73603,110150, Family Of Slain U.S. Journalist Wants The Syrian Regime Brought To Justice,Buzzfeed News,Jina Moore,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/jinamoore/family-of-slain-american-journalist-sues-syria
","'Read the full text of the complaint:'] The family of a slain American journalist is suing Syria for her death, in the first war crimes case to be brought against top Syrian officials since the civil war began five years ago. Marie Colvin, 56, died in a rocket attack in the Syrian city of Homs in February 2012. Colvin was deliberately targeted and assassinated by Syrian President Bashar  's government, as part of a strategic campaign against local and foreign journalists, the lawsuit alleges. “Not only do we have a blow by blow account of how she was deliberately murdered  —   assassinated  —   but we can trace it out to an entire pattern of targeting journalists throughout 2011 and into 2012,” said Scott Gilmore, an attorney with the Center for Justice and Accountability (CJA) who investigated the case. The night before she was killed, Colvin broadcast reports to CNN and BBC, among others, from the Baba Amr Media Center, a secret makeshift studio in an opposition neighborhood that had come under daily shelling since early February. Colvin's broadcast signal was intercepted by military officials, and her physical location was revealed to intelligence officials by a local informant. Military officials asked the informant to pinpoint the location of the secret studio on a map and then planned an artillery attack against Colvin and other foreign journalists staying at the Media Center, according to the complaint. A French photographer was also killed in the attack, and two others were severely injured. A Syrian official refuted the allegations on Saturday. “I can assure you that this is false by all standards and is certainly not true,” Mohammed Ramez Turgeman, the Syrian minister of information, told the Washington Post. The complaint summarizes nearly four years of investigation by CJA, drawing on accounts from eyewitnesses  survivors, and regime defectors and on some of the 600, 000 documents smuggled out of Syria by the Commission for International Justice and Accountability. The complaint names nine officials, including Assad's brother and a leader of one Syria's local “paramilitary death squads,” known as shabiha. Cathleen Colvin, plaintiff in the lawsuit and sister of Marie Colvin, says the evidence Gilmore and his colleagues uncovered confirmed her earliest suspicions that her sister had been deliberately targeted. “All along, I thought it was too much of a coincidence. Her story the night before on CNN [said] the Syrian government is lying, it is indiscriminately shelling a city full of starved civilians,” Colvin told BuzzFeed News by telephone. “Her reporting the night before [her death] was so powerful, and to get call the next morning she's killed  —   I thought they were trying to silence her from the beginning. ” Colvin said photographer Paul Conroy, who survived the attack on the Media Center, also suspected the journalists had been targeted. “Paul is   and he could tell by the pattern of fire that they were zeroing in, that it wasn't a random attack,” Colvin said. Colvin said she was moved to file the suit out of a desire to see officials in the Assad regime brought to justice and to renew the focus on ongoing atrocities in Syria. “I wanted to call attention to [the Syrians'] suffering and how many families lost loved ones in Syria, and also to the fact that no one is there to witness it,” she said. “The Assads of the world can operate with impunity. ” Colvin's lawsuit is the first case to be brought against Assad officials for war crimes  —   and is brought under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which allows American citizens to sue countries designated by the U. S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. “Taking Marie away from us was just so painful. I was really lucky to have her in my life  —   she was my biggest supporter, and I was hers  —   and to have someone deliberately take that away is just something I can't live with without doing something about it,” Colvin said. “I would love to be able to bring criminal charges in the Hague but I can't. ” The Hague is home to the International Criminal Court, but it can't try Assad or other Syrian officials without a referral by the United Nations Security Council  —   and that's not likely to happen any time soon. “The prospect of ICC is pretty much dead in the water,” says Toby Cadman, a British lawyer who has worked on war crimes cases in Bosnia, Bangladesh, Syria and elsewhere. “The ICC has no jurisdiction over Syria, and the Security Council will never refer the matter. Russia and China have consistently vetoed any resolution referring the situation to the ICC and will continue to do so. ” As permanent members of the council, Russia and China can halt any referral with a veto. Russia has a particular interest in keeping the issue away from the ICC because its own military is also involved on the ground there, Cadman noted. “There is a distinct lack of accountability on the international level” for the atrocities that have been committed in Syria, Cadman said. The Colvin lawsuit is “hugely significant [as] a first step in ensuring justice and accountability in Syria. ” But it is just a first step. Cadman and other lawyers are working on bringing more cases, both civil and criminal, against Assad and his allies in national courts around the world. France, Spain and England all have universal jurisdiction laws that allow their courts to hear criminal cases against Assad, and Cadman says he and other lawyers intend to use them. “Criminal cases will be opened and defendants, once arrested, will be prosecuted,” he said. “The Marie Colvin case is the first case. I expect the US Court to uphold the complaint and award millions in compensation to the plaintiffs. That is important. But what is equally, if not more important, is that criminal cases will follow. ”   "

","'The Paris Salon du Chocolat is basically the closest thing to experiencing Willy Wonka's chocolate factory in real life. The annual gathering brings together the world's finest   and  .' 'But amid all these dazzling creations, something odd stands out. The show, which travels around the world, has never had an exhibition stand by chocolatiers from any of Africa's 54 countries.' ' Four West African countries  —   Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria  —   produce nearly   of the world's cocoa beans, the magic ingredient without which there is no chocolate.' ' Enter Instant Chocolat, a   company from Ivory Coast, who want to stir things up. They hope to make history by becoming the first company from the continent to represent at this year's prestigious Paris Salon.' ' Tucked into the corner of West Africa, Ivory Coast is the planet's cocoa capital,   growing nearly half of the global supply of the sweet beans. That spurred Ivorian Axel Emmanuel to quit his banking job five years ago, and begin making personalized cakes and chocolates in Abidjan, Ivory Coast's main city.' ' “We thought, wait, Ivory Coast produces 40% of global cocoa so why aren't we in the chocolate business?” Instant Chocolat   Yvan Akré told BuzzFeed News by phone from Abidjan.' ' A team of just six chefs and one designer craft every single chocolate  —   and the stylish wrapper!  —   by hand.' ' The company has taken off in the last year. They've had calls from as far afield as Cameroon, the U. S. Canada, and Guinea. One order was from a Moroccan company that wanted 25 tons of chocolate.' ' Even sweeter is the fact the chocolates often showcase their Ivorian roots, whether through delicate cocoa pod etchings or celebrating masks from the Zaouli culture.' ' Chocolates haven't traditionally been a snack of choice in West Africa, where the average person eats roughly four Snickers bars' worth of the stuff a year. By comparison, Americans typically chow down 82 bars' worth annually. “People here often see chocolate as a luxury product,” Akré pointed out.' ' That's partly because it's expensive  —   the raw beans are exported abroad for processing, then shipped back as costly chocolate bars. Processing agricultural goods at home could lift millions out of poverty, but it's often neglected for sexier  —   and quicker  —   pursuits like oil and diamonds.' ' There are a few delicious exceptions. This gorgeous tiny island is Principe. Once the world's biggest exporter of cocoa beans, it's today home to one last plantation that still produces some of the world's finest, most expensive chocolate.'

73605,110152, Trump Campaign CEO Was Accused Of Sexual Harassment In ‘90s Legal Dispute,Buzzfeed News,Andrew Kaczynski,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-campaign-ceo-was-accused-of-sexual-harassment-in-90s-l
"," Trump's campaign CEO Stephen Bannon and an associate were accused of sexual harassment in a 1990s court case. The suit was related to Bannon's time as director of Biosphere 2, a research facility located in Oracle, Arizona, that aimed to simulate the surface of Mars. Then a Los Angeles —  based investment banker, Bannon worked as a consultant trying to cut ballooning costs related to the ecological research center at behest of Texas billionaire Edward Bass, the project's financial backer. The suit, filed by Biosphere 2's former director Margret Augustine, named Bass as the primary defendant. Bannon and a fellow banker, Martin Bowen, were also named and accused of having acted as his agents. Augustine accused Bass of having used his agents to dissociate her from the Biosphere project in breach of an earlier agreement. She also accused him of using Bannon and Bowen to slander her by saying she had stolen from the Biosphere gift shop and the project's construction fund. Soon after filing the complaint, she dropped a claim that Bannon and Bowen had invaded her privacy by deleting messages from her answering machine and opening her mail, saying that she would only press charges for incidents that occurred before April 1, 1994. The claims provoked a   from Space Biosphere Ventures, the company that controlled the project, accusing Augustine of having engaged in   and stealing from the company. But the most explosive allegations were that Bannon and Bowen, had made sexually suggestive remarks and lewd remarks toward her, and had disparaged female employees of the research facility. Both Bannon and Bowen denied the sexual harassment at the time. An affidavit from Bannon said he “did not undertake any sexual harassment towards Margaret Augustine. ” On Monday, a spokeswoman for Bannon told BuzzFeed News, “The Bass Organization sued Ms. Augustine for fraud for embezzling $800, 000. She then sued two representatives of the Bass Organization having never complained about any behavior. Subsequently, she dropped her legal action. Ms Augustine was removed as CEO in a corporate restructuring in 1993. ” In her complaint, Augustine said, “Both Bowen and Bannon were insulting to the plaintiff and other females employees of Biosphere 2, and in their presence, and against their will, made lewd remarks, told offensive   stories, made disparaging remarks about females, made sexually suggestive remarks, discussed females they had known in a lewd and derogatory fashion and in general acted with total indifference to the feelings of the plaintiff and other female employees of Biosphere 2. ” Augustine claimed specifically that Bannon once commented the problem with an employee she “was a woman in a man's job. ” She claimed that during a trip, “Steve Bannon and Martin Bowen made comments as women walked by about the size of women's breasts and body parts in lewd tones and language. Martin spoke about a centerfold in Playboy magazine who was born in a town he went to school in or grew up in, in Texas on 5 separate occasions, discussing the size of her ‘boobs,' ‘titties,' etc. ” She said at company party she danced with Bannon and he “held my wrist tightly and told me that once I'd done it with him I'd never want to do it with anyone else. ” On another occasion, she said Bannon yelled at her, citing another employee's performance. “Steve Bannon started shouting at me that the whole ‘Goddam problem was that I let Larry Pomatte get his swinging dick in here.' I stood up and said I would not continue a meeting being spoken to in that manner. Steve said, ‘You will Goddam well will sit the fuck down and  …    '” She said she was shaken and ended the meeting. Augustine added in the complaint she contacted Bass about the behavior to advise him about the conduct but not action was taken. As a result, she alleged, Bannon “continued to make the same sort of lewd, suggestive, rude, and insulting comments to the plaintiff and other female employees of Biosphere 2. ” She said as a result she “suffered severe mental distress and anxiety” that required “the help of medical care practitioners and the incurring of medical and hospital bills as a result thereof. ” Bass had sued Augustine just a day before her case was filed. His suit claimed that Augustine “allegedly paid a company she owned nearly $800, 000 in   Biosphere funds,” according to a report in the Tucson Citizen. Bass accused her of “diverting funds for her personal use, including having SBV pay to remodel her house, thefts from the six gift shops, kickbacks, and apparent sweetheart deals with subcontractor,” according to author Jane Poynter in The Human Experiment: Two Years and Twenty Minutes Inside Biosphere 2. The judge ruled in favor of the defense on Augustine's allegation that Bass had dissociated her from the project and Augustine ultimately dropped her slander claims, in addition to her claims that her privacy was invaded. The sexual harassment count, along with the   against Augustine, was ultimately settled. Augustine's lawyer was not immediately available to discuss the case. Augustine did not return a request for comment on the matter. Bowen did not return a request for comment. Neither Bass, nor his publicist, immediately returned a request for comment. According two books on Biosphere 2 and newspaper accounts, Bannon had originally been brought into bring costs under but was not allowed by the current management, including Augustine, to audit the project's records with accounts conflicting as to why. Bass got a court order take control of the project and an order to bar the current management employees from the premise, and that's when Bannon was given control. On Friday, Mother Jones reported on a separate trial related to Biosphere where Bannon said in testimony that he had called one of the plaintiffs a “  deluded young woman” and a “bimbo. ” The “bimbo” comment came after the plaintiff had compared a atmospheric breach into the closed research center to the space shuttle Challenger explosion, according to a report in the Arizona Daily Star. Bannon would eventually leave the project and Columbia University would take over Biosphere 2.  "

"," Trump's campaign CEO, Stephen Bannon, said during a 2011 radio interview that progressives vilify prominent women in the conservative movement because they are not “a bunch of dykes that came from the Seven Sisters schools. ” Citing women like Ann Coulter, Michele Bachmann, and Sarah Palin, Bannon said conservative women threaten the progressive narrative. “And so these women cut to the heart of the progressive narrative,” he said on Political Vindication Radio while promoting his movie, Fire From the Heartland: the Awakening of the Conservative Woman. “That's why there are some unintended consequences of the women's liberation movement. That, in fact, the women that would lead this country would be   they would have husbands, they would love their children. They wouldn't be a bunch of dykes that came from the Seven Sisters schools up in New England. That drives the left insane and that's why they hate these women,” he said. The Seven Sisters schools are the historic women's colleges of Barnard College, Bryn Mawr College, Mount Holyoke College, Radcliffe College, Smith College, Vassar College, and Wellesley College in the Northeast. Bannon's past has come under scrutiny in recent days, with old court filings showing he faced accusations from his   of   and domestic violence. Bannon said earlier in the 2011 interview that the progressive narrative was all about victimhood. “The progressive narrative Saturday morning was the progressive narrative and that is all about victimhood,” he said. “They're either a victim of race. They're victim of their sexual preference. They're a victim of gender. All about victimhood and the USA is the great oppressor, not the great liberator. ”  "

Bannon made the remarks in an October 2012 interview on Conservative Republican Forum Radio, when he was still chairman of Breitbart News and promoting his documentary, The Hope and the Change. “Mitt Romney goes to the Republican convention, gives his acceptance speech, people give him a standing ovation, and he doesn't have the common decency to say one thing about our troops fighting in Afghanistan?” Bannon said. “This is a guy who avoided military duty in Vietnam who has five sons who look like movie stars who have not served their country one day. Oh, but by the way all of them did their two years of Mormon missionary service  —   every one of them. ” Romney obtained four draft deferments during the Vietnam war, three for his academic studies and one for his service as a Mormon “minister of religion. ” Trump also received four draft deferments, including one medical deferment that his campaign has attributed to bone spurs in his feet. Trump, meanwhile, has struggled throughout 2016 to win over traditionally Republican Mormon voters, and he acknowledged in a speech earlier this month that he's having a “tremendous problem in Utah. ” Spokespeople for Bannon and the Romney family did not respond to requests for comment. 			Independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin, who is Mormon, said in a statement to BuzzFeed News that Bannon's 2012 comments are a reflection of religious bigotry. “This is the kind of revolting intolerance Trump embraces and encourages when he hires a thug like Steve Bannon, who profits from racism,   and religious bigotry against everyone from Mormons to Muslims. Religious, racial and other intolerance should have no place in American public life. Steve Bannon and Trump obviously disagree. ”			 			Bannon made the comments in October 2012 on CRF Radio.

73609,110157," Something's Gone Wrong At Starbucks, According To Baristas",Buzzfeed News,Venessa Wong,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/venessawong/heres-why-lines-have-grown-so-long-at-starbucks
"," Have you experienced   lines at Starbucks lately? If so, some of the company's staff say there's a reason for the longer waits: the coffee chain has been cutting back on worker hours, leading to declining service in stores. As a   business, Starbucks has been on a roll lately  —   the coffee chain reported another quarter of record sales and profit last week. So it baffled many of the company's hourly employees in the U. S. when, as business boomed this spring, they noticed a dramatic change: they weren't getting enough hours of work. Eight Starbucks employees from several cities around the country told BuzzFeed News that since May, the number of work hours assigned to stores by the chain's Global Labor Scheduling (GLS) system has fallen far below both what they need and what they normally receive. The change came with no warning or explanation from executives some staff say their schedules were cut in advance, while others have been sent home during their shifts. Many have taken to social media to complain, with some threatening to quit. It's an unexpected turn for the Seattle coffee chain, which has long considered itself an employer of choice in a fast food industry infamous for   pay and benefits, and demoralized workers. An internal communication portal used by the company has received numerous complaints from staff  —   “partners,” in Starbucks lingo  —   about reduced hours and declining morale, according to screenshots provided to BuzzFeed News. Starbucks told BuzzFeed News there has been no change in labor strategy and managers are being asked to handle staffing as needed on a    basis. “We are not trying to reduce labor. We want our stores staffed in accordance with what they each need,” said spokesperson Jaime Riley. Yet an internal company email reviewed by BuzzFeed News, which was sent to field leaders in May, suggests the company is closely watching labor expenses across the chain as growth slows. It said the weeks in May and June following Starbucks' Frappuccino Happy Hour promotion are “historically challenging weeks to forecast and schedule as the business experiences a significant decrease in transactions, resulting in an overspend in labor. ” The email asks field leaders to help control this overspending using a new “forecasting tool” that would “adjust forecasts and compensate for downward trend in business. ” “‘Reducing overspending' seems like good business sense,” Riley, the Starbucks spokesperson, said in response to the email. Starbucks staff told BuzzFeed News that store managers use the company's GLS software to determine how many worker hours they can allocate. The managers input how many transactions they think their location will ring up for a given week, and the system generates an allocation of total labor hours, using an algorithm that also takes into account historical sales. The store manager then assigns those hours to individual workers. But in recent months, staff say that managers noticed their estimates were returning fewer hours. Just by way of illustration, if an estimated 800 transactions usually earned a store 70 hours of labor, the store might now receive only 65 hours for the same estimate. “Someone seemingly flipped a switch on the labor model,” one manager who has worked for Starbucks for nearly a decade told BuzzFeed News. “The whole month of July has been the tightest in scheduling I've ever experienced,” said another longtime manager. Starbucks sales, despite reaching new highs, have fallen short of expectations for the last nine months. The chain experienced a slowdown in U. S. sales growth from April to June  —   sales at cafes open at least 13 months increased by 4% compared to 8% during the same period last year. The company has called its recent performance an anomaly and expects its domestic business to pick up again. “With costs of raw coffee going up and minimum wage rising, they will be looking for cost efficiencies anyplace they can find them,” said Jack Russo, an analyst at Edward Jones. I noticed a change in service myself back in June, as did other Starbucks customers. @Starbucks the customer service at my local shop is getting pretty disappointing. What's going on? :( 25min to get a latte at @Starbucks today was a new low in customer service. Time for a change? Starbucks' recent labor situation was the subject of an online worker petition started in June. Cutting back on hours “creates an atmosphere where baristas are worn to the bone without being able to take a breath. Cleanliness suffers, speed of service suffers, partners suffer  …    . .the labor climate keeps most baristas regularly underemployed, enough to qualify for benefits, but not enough to afford to pay for them,” it read. The petition has attracted 13, 500 signatures so far. Despite the attention garnered by the petition, Starbucks says it has been tracking complaints from its employees and only 3% have been related to staffing and scheduling in recent weeks. Riley, the company spokesperson, said the chain has received “overwhelmingly positive” feedback about a U. S. pay raise announced this month, which moves a scheduled pay bump forward from next January to this October. On Monday, Starbucks confirmed to BuzzFeed News that it will also pay a $500 bonus to employees who have been with the company for at least two years. When it comes to the perceived cutback in hours, “we encourage partners to work with managers on staffing scheduling needs,” Riley said. A number of Starbucks workers  —   many who said they used to love their jobs  —   have shared their stories online about the effect of reductions in hours. Here are some condensed excerpts. “Because our store manager is contacted constantly about hours, we are asked to send labor updates at 12p, 4p, and 8p every day. But even if we end up 100+ transactions over forecast and have already cut hours, we're told we should have cut more. My store continually meets and exceeds the confusing, sometimes nearly impossible goals set forth by a computer system and people who are 1, 000 miles away. ”   Leslie, “Although my schedules say 20 hours, since labor is being cut I can never hit the 20 hour mark. That means I don't qualify for benefits. My husband's 40 hours a week [at Starbucks] have turned into 29 hours a week. It's hard. It's hard to think about the next schedules being put up, and dreading looking at he number of hours we are getting. Trying to calculate how much money we need to make just to get the kids fed, keep the lights on, and gas in the car. No one wants to give up hours, which means picking up shifts is getting harder and harder because everyone is scrounging for hours. .I've never seen such an aggression about labor before. Over five years, and I've never had to truly worry about my hours, they stayed consistent. .with the occasional ‘You wanna go home early today?' But now it's ‘You have to go home, we are way over on labor.'   …     In the past six months, I have heard more about numbers and labor than I have in the five years I've been with Starbucks. ”   Caylee, “I noticed we seemed to be short staffed more often and it always felt like we were all flustered or moving at a dizzying pace. I also became a shift supervisor about a month ago. Advancing in my position is a huge change as it is. Add in even less people to work with but having the same volume of customers, and I am so physically and emotionally exhausted that my job is not even fun for me anymore. Want to know the last time I had a lunch break during one of my eight hour shifts? I couldn't even tell you since it has been so long ago. In fact, today I worked a nine hour shift on the floor with just one   break, long enough to take a few sips of my iced vanilla chai and eat a doughnut. ”   Stephannie, “With only two people on the floor at a cafe, we can barely keep up, as the lobby is neglected and bathrooms and customers are complaining. I plan to hang in there but a lot of partners have no choice but look for other employment. ”   Vickie, “Short night shifts, cut down to two hours because of being sent home early, were too much. We were closing the highest volume store in the city with only three employees in the tourist area of town. It was a constant battle of being sent home early, or scrambling all night, unable to get everything done. Driving 30 minutes to work wasn't worth it, especially for the poor pay as a barista with a newborn at home. ”   Bailey, “However, the reality is that if I spend my morning on the floor with six or seven people who are killing themselves to fill customer orders that really call for eight or nine baristas (mostly because [Global Labor Scheduling] doesn't adequately account for things like   orders or food [orders]) I'm exhausted by the time I get home. Beyond that, being overworked and understaffed hurts partner morale. It makes it so that stores not as clean and pleasant as they should be, and customers are not taken care of in the way that they deserve to be. ”   Noel, “Orders are put on the bar where our solo barista makes every single beverage as fast as possible while trying to focus on what they are doing whilst grabbing all those stickers from cafe,   and [mobile order and pay]. The drive thru times are suffering horribly our average ticket is six to eight drinks each car! It looks bad on the company from a guests perspective to have three or four partners on the floor when the place is absolute chaos. ”   Samantha, “But you can see it in our faces and demeanors how much it's taking its toll. And now I received a paycheck for not even $200 that is nowhere near enough to pay my rent and bills. This so for two weeks work! !! Our store has failed two [Quality Assurance Standards Assessment] audits in the month because it never stays clean enough because we never have enough people to maintain the store. We never have schedules ready until a few days before the next week starts. Deliveries are made and stay there for days because on two man sets who's going to put it away. We're just exhausted, disappointed and now angry that all of our hard work is being taken for granted. I can't survive on this dismal pay and only 15 to 20 weekly tips. I'm going to have to cut off my medical insurance and stop 401k just so I can make ends meet! I love my job but I can't survive in this atmosphere!”   Andre,   "
73610,110159, Confidential Document Shows How Peter Thiel Really Feels About Palantir,Buzzfeed News,William Alden,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/williamalden/leak-shows-how-peter-thiel-really-feels-about-palantir
"," A confidential document from tech billionaire Peter Thiel's venture capital firm raises doubts about the valuation of Palantir Technologies, the highly touted Silicon Valley data analysis company of which Thiel is   and chairman. The document also reveals that Thiel's firm's own investment results are among the strongest in the industry, at least on paper. Palantir, a    startup that crunches data for   agencies and corporate giants, sold shares to investors last year at a valuation of roughly $20 billion, making it the    American tech startup, behind only Uber and Airbnb. But at the same time, Thiel's firm, Founders Fund  —   an early and repeat backer of Palantir  —   privately pegged Palantir's valuation at nearly 40% less than that, according to the document, a slide deck for investors that was reviewed by BuzzFeed News. Founders Fund assessed Palantir's value at $12. 7 billion as of Sept. 30, 2015, according to a footnote in the document. This   carrying value is 38% lower than the valuation of $20. 6 billion that Palantir received from investors in the latest financing round, the document shows. (The $20. 6 billion figure differs from the $20 billion figure because it includes the cash raised in the round, as of Sept. 30.) Other major investors have also taken a conservative stance on Palantir's worth. As of March 31, several big mutual funds, including two managed by Morgan Stanley, valued their Palantir shares at 48% below the price in last year's investment round, according to data collected by research firm Morningstar. But the opinion of Thiel  —   a celebrity in Silicon Valley and a demigod inside Palantir  —   will likely turn heads among some Palantir shareholders and employees, who have already voiced concerns about their ability to sell their shares. Thiel, who started Founders Fund with two partners in 2005, knows as much about Palantir as virtually anyone, leading the company's   board. While Palantir has grown in both revenue and employees, its $420 million in cash collections for 2015 amounted to less than a quarter of its customer bookings, raising questions about Palantir's ability to convert those deals into revenue, BuzzFeed News reported in May. A founder of PayPal and board member of Facebook, Thiel will take prime position on the national stage tonight, delivering a speech in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention. Earlier this year, the famously libertarian Thiel generated national headlines when it was revealed that he secretly financed the wrestler Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker Media, as part of a   campaign to punish the company. At Palantir, insiders often describe projects in terms of “zero to one,” Thiel's favored catchphrase for creating something new. The valuation disparity revealed in the Founders Fund document could highlight little more than a quirk in how startups are valued by their various investors. It's not unusual for top venture firms to privately value their portfolio companies at levels below what was reached in a recent financing round, three venture capitalists told BuzzFeed News, though it is hard to say whether a discount as big as 40% is common. Venture firms reason that it's safer to be conservative when reporting valuations of companies that aren't yet publicly traded, since “it's better to write up an investment when it exits than to write it down because it's imperiled,” said David Pakman, a partner at Venrock in NY. But another venture capitalist, Roger Ehrenberg, managing partner of IA Ventures, said a lower carrying value could be the result of a number of factors, including a financial stumble by the company or simply a different method for determining what a company is worth. “Where carrying value is lower, you need to ask yourself why,” he said in an email. The methodology Founders Fund used to value Palantir isn't known. For another one of its investments, the rocket company SpaceX, Founders Fund did not report a carrying value, instead using the valuation from a recent investment round, according to a person who has seen that page of the confidential document. Spokespeople for Founders Fund and Palantir both declined to comment. As for Founders Fund itself, it appears to be living up to its reputation as one of the top venture capital firms in Silicon Valley. Its first four investment funds have reported returns that exceeded the best funds of their class, the confidential document shows. (Several of the funds are actually fund groups, with a main fund accompanied by smaller funds.) The firm's first fund, which dates to 2005, reported a 37% net internal rate of return, or IRR, through the end of September, far surpassing an 11% benchmark of   funds compiled by the research and advisory firm Cambridge Associates. The second (dating to 2007) third (2010) and fourth (2011) funds reported net IRRs of 33% 36% and 58% respectively, each surpassing the benchmark of   funds for those years. The fifth fund, totaling $1. 1 billion, dates to 2014 and reported a 79% net IRR, but the IRR metric, by its nature, tends to be significantly higher for younger funds. A number of the firm's   investments showed strong gains on paper as of the end of September. Its investment in the home rental site Airbnb was up 8. 1 times, its investment in SpaceX was up 8. 7 times, its investment in music streaming service Spotify was up 9. 3 times, and its investment in Palantir was up 6. 2 times, the document shows. Its stake in the health insurance startup Oscar was up 2. 6 times, according to the document, and its stake in the payments processor Stripe was up 2. 7 times. At the same time, the confidential performance results showed how long it can take a venture capital firm like Founders Fund to return cash to its investors. As many startups, including Palantir, avoid the public markets, venture capitalists have had a harder time doing the   work of selling their investment stakes and realizing profits. Venture capital funds typically are supposed to produce cash returns after 10 years or a little longer, but according to a recent analysis by the National Venture Capital Association, only 27% of funds had been dissolved after 12 years or less. For example, Founders Fund's second main fund, worth $211 million and dating to 2007, had liquidated only $108 million of securities as of Sept. 30, or about 51% of the fund's initial assets, according to the document. It had distributed just 21% of the fund to investors  —   meaning investors hadn't even come close to getting their investment back. While that fund had multiplied its assets by more than eight (including the value of illiquid securities, as well as realized proceeds and distributions to investors) the net realized gains for that fund group amounted to $85. 8 million, according to the document. In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that Founders Fund's second fund was trying to sell Palantir shares, reflecting a broader desire by venture capitalists to cash in on their startup investments. A subsequent Journal article reported that some investors who had given money to Founders Fund said they had “grown impatient that they aren't receiving bigger cash distributions. ” The confidential document does not capture a more recent success for Founders Fund. In April, drug company AbbVie agreed to buy a Founders Fund portfolio company, the cancer drug developer Stemcentrx, for $5. 8 billion, producing the largest “exit” in Founders Fund's history, according to Bloomberg News. Founders Fund used the confidential document to help raise its sixth fund, worth $1. 3 billion, in March. The information about Palantir comes from a slide showing Founders Fund's investments in the data company over time. The firm said it had invested a total of $164. 5 million in Palantir through six investment rounds and various small purchases of common stock all but $8 million of Founders Fund's stake is in preferred shares. This stake was worth $1. 07 billion as of the end of September (a tally that includes a $44. 7 million distribution to investors from the first fund) the document shows. Palantir raised a total of $880 million in a financing round last year, from at least July to December, public filings show. The round began with the company aiming to raise $500 million. The information in the confidential document, dating to Sept. 30, falls in the middle of the investment period. Separately, Palantir recently said it would buy up to $225 million of its own common stock from current and former employees, part of a broader effort to address unease among staff, BuzzFeed News reported. The price offered by Palantir for common shares was higher than where several mutual fund investors were valuing the company's preferred shares.  "

"," Netflix's growth in the U. S. has slowed to a   and the company is adding new international users slower than expected. Overall, the company added 1. 7 million new subscribers in the last three months  —   less than the 2. 5 million the company predicted  —   and just 160, 000 of them were in the U. S. That's well below the 700, 000 extra U. S. subscribers that analysts were expecting the company to report, according to data collected by Bloomberg. The company now has just over 83 million subscribers, according to its quarterly earnings letter released on Monday. Investors have become used to the streaming service losing money or making tiny profits, but typically its financial performance was paired with explosive growth in paid subscribers. This time around, the missing growth resulted in investors selling off Netflix stock, which fell by over 15% in   trading following the results announcement. As usual, the company's revenue grew by a lot and it turned a small profit: $41 million, up from $26 million in the second quarter of last year, on $2. 1 billion in revenue, up from $1. 6 billion a year ago. Netflix announced a vast global expansion earlier this year, and its service is now available in virtually every country in the world, with the notable exception of China. “This year the regulatory climate in China for our service has become more challenging,” the company said in its letter on Monday. It said the slow growth wasn't due to a lack of new subscribers  —   total new users were “on target”  —   but mainly caused by its plan to raise monthly prices for its longtime subscribers, to $9. 99 up from $7. 99. While the company has said it would “grandfather” the old prices for up to two years, some people seem to be canceling their plans even before the hike takes effect. “We think some members perceived the news as an impending new price increase rather than the completion of two years of grandfathering. Churn of members who were actually un grandfathered is modest and conforms to our expectations,” the company said in its letter. In adding 160, 000 new U. S. users, Netflix fell well short of the growth achieved in previous quarters. It added just over 500, 000 new users in the U. S. in the second quarter of 2014 and 900, 000 in the second quarter of 2015. It expects that slower growth to continue into the next quarter, with 300, 000 net new users in the U. S. well below the 1 million it added in the third quarter of 2014 or 2. 74 million they added in the third quarter last year.  "

","'These sandals are $77 cheaper at Saks than Off 5th.' 'These   pumps are about $48 cheaper at Saks Fifth Avenue than Off 5th.' 'These flats were $52 less at Saks. '] The discounts at outlet stores aren't always as great as you might imagine. There are instances, even, when shoppers get a better deal at regular retailers. Take Off 5th, the outlet arm of   retailer Saks Fifth Avenue. Off 5th markets itself as “the premier   destination. ” Yet BuzzFeed News found several examples where it listed designer shoes for more than its regular retail counterpart Saks. The pricing discrepancy comes as Hudson Bay, which owns both brands, plans to expand its presence in the   market, where   products are sold for less than the typical retail price, according to its 2015 annual report. In February, it acquired Gilt Groupe, which runs the discount site Gilt. com, for $250 million. Consumers clearly are looking for deals, even if they're not always shopping in the right places. Both    store and online sales increased at Off 5th by 1. 7% while sales at Saks Fifth Avenue decreased by 1% during the 12 months ending in January. “One of the biggest challenges for companies as they enter the   industry is how they are able to manage the cross merchandise,” said Marshal Cohen, a retail industry analyst with NPD. “The challenge is how do you see the inventory, keep their products separate and not cannibalize   products. ” A pair of Vince leather slingback wedge sandals, for instance, are listed for $189. 99 at Off 5th, roughly $77 more than at Saks. Both sites list a regular price of $375 for the shoes. A pair of discounted Stuart Weitzman leather pumps were $138 to $142 at Saks Fifth Avenue, less than the $190 Off 5th was asking. A spokesperson for Saks Fifth Avenue and Off 5th told BuzzFeed News that the price issue may be a result of clearance sales that come every year between seasons. “Saks Fifth Avenue and Saks Off 5th operate separately as distinct banners, and there is no overlap for   merchandise,” she said. “While this is a rare occurrence, an unintentional overlap may occur during a clearance period. ” Typically,   stores like Off 5th are able to offer luxury products for less because they are    or are only available in sizes that do not sell as quickly, said NY University Stern School of Business professor Priya Raghubir. Off 5th, along with a number of other discount retailers, also sells cheaper,    items. So it's an “anomaly” that Saks Fifth Avenue would offer a steeper discount on the exact same product, in a wider range of sizes, Raghubir said. These Vince metallic leather espadrille flats, for example, were $52 less at Saks than at Off 5th. The discrepancy may still be rare, but it's significant. “If I were the   store, I would really be cracking the prices in the regular store because they have a brand image to protect,” Raghubir said. “The reason they are in business is they offer merchandise at lower price point. If they are no longer doing that, the entire reason for their existence is called into question. ”   "

"," On August 21, a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the federal government from enforcing guidance and rules  —   based on Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972  —   that protect transgender students in public schools. That decision did not go as far as Texas and 11 other states behind the lawsuit wanted. They had requested a preliminary injunction that also would suspend policies and guidance under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that protect transgender workers. But the judge's order didn't mention Title VII or workers  —   just Title IX and schools. That might seem to settle the matter: The government cannot enforce its guidance in schools or in litigation resulting from that school guidance, the thinking goes, but it could enforce its rules when a transgender employee alleges discrimination in a workplace. But now, more than a week since US District Court Judge Reed O'Connor issued his order, there is growing uncertainty about how the federal government will proceed. At the heart of the problem, according to Ezra Young, a staff attorney at the Transgender Legal Defense  Education Fund (TLDEF) is that the language in Judge O'Connor's injunction could be read fairly broadly. “It unclear as to which laws and agencies it attempts to enjoin enforcement of,” Young told BuzzFeed News. “We believe clarification is needed. ” For example, O'Connor writes that the injunction “shall be binding on Defendants”  —   and the defendants include agencies that deal with employment, such as the Department of Labor and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In addition, O'Connor's order bans the agencies from asserting the “guidelines” carry weight in court in cases initiated after his order, but Young said it is unclear if those guidelines concern only policies in schools or also in workplaces. Young said early Tuesday that he expected government lawyers to ask the court for “clarification as to which defendants are enjoined and which issues are covered by injunction  —   whether it is just Title IX or whether it goes further than Title IX. ” On Tuesday evening, the Justice Department did file a file a notice asking for clarification, but only insofar as to ask O'Connor “to make it clear beyond any doubt that they are free to proceed” with a list of cases that the department determined are related to, but distinct from, the Texas litigation. Detailing its view of the limits set by O'Connor in the injunction, Justice Department lawyers then state that they “believe that the cases listed   …     fall outside the scope of these prohibitions”  —   meaning that the department believes it should be free to continue litigating those cases. On the larger question of the injunction itself, the Justice Department added in Tuesday night's filing that it “expect[s] to file a motion seeking relief with respect to the Court's preliminary injunction. ” It did not, however, give any timeline as to when it will do so. BuzzFeed News earlier had asked the Department of Justice and EEOC, which oversees enforcement of civil rights law in workplaces, whether they would continue to investigate complaints from transgender workers and enforce their interpretation of Title VII. The Justice Department did not answer the question, and the question of investigating new potential cases was not addressed in Tuesday's filing. A spokesperson for the EEOC, Kimberly   did respond, but only said that the agency “is currently reviewing the [judge's] order and assessing its implications. ” That evasion is at odds from the EEOC's outspoken positions over the past several years. It first found that Title VII's ban on sex discrimination prohibits transgender discrimination in 2012, then later expanded that specifically to include such things as restroom usage. But Paul Castillo, a lawyer for Lambda Legal, which had filed a brief in the case supporting the transgender protections, told BuzzFeed News that his view of O'Connor's order is that the agencies can still enforce rules for transgender workers. “The judge's order doesn't stop them from investigating and and processing complaints under Title VII,” he said, adding that the EEOC “can continue business as usual. ” The Texas Attorney General's Office, asked about the scope of the judge's order, also said it only directly concerns schools, governed by Title IX. “This order does not address Title VII,” said spokesperson Kayleigh Lovvorn. There could, however, be an effect on workplace cases, she said, because courts consider case law interpreting Title IX when evaluating a case concerning Title VII. “Thus, the injunction will impact Title VII adjudications. ” The EEOC has been at the legal vanguard to argue that existing civil rights law protects transgender people. In the past four years, it has accepted complaints and filed litigation against employers that it found discriminated on the basis of gender identity. And in 2014,   General Eric Holder said the Justice Department would maintain the same position in its litigation. If the EEOC is halting that work for now, the impact could affect cases between two private parties  —   not just those cases that rely on government participation. This is why: Before a worker can sue an employer under federal civil rights law, the agency details, he or she must first file a complaint with the EEOC and obtain a “    ” letter. Asked if the EEOC would continue, in the wake of the Texas court ruling, to accept complaints and issue    letters to workers alleging   discrimination so those workers could pursue lawsuits on their own,   did not comment. Young, the TLDEF attorney, said, “Our understanding is that the EEOC, like the other defendants in the litigation, is seeking clarification on what the injunction means. That is very likely why they are declining to answer questions about the    letter. ”  "

","'Read the order:'] A federal judge in Texas has blocked the Obama administration's federal policies protecting transgender students and workers, issuing a nationwide injunction against enforcement of the policies regarding restroom use. U. S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor in Fort Worth issued the order sought by Texas and 10 other states on Sunday. The states sued the Obama administration in May over its guidelines regarding accommodating transgender students in restrooms and facilities at public schools. The 11 states had asked O'Connor to suspend Obama's policies  —   largely an interpretation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972  —   in a hearing held on Aug. 12. “Defendants have conspired to turn workplaces and educational settings across the country into laboratories for a massive social experiment, flouting the democratic process, and running roughshod over commonsense policies protecting children and basic privacy rights,” the states' complaint stated. In his   order, O'Connor ruled that the states had standing to bring their lawsuit because the administration's “Guidelines are clearly designed to target [their] conduct. ” The court found that the Obama administration's actions likely violate the Administrative Procedure Act for failing to follow proper notice and comment procedures under the law because, the court found, the policies are “legislative and substantive. ” Additionally, the court found that, under the text of the law, the Obama administration's interpretation is incorrect  —   a ruling that contradicts an earlier decision from the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in a related case challenging a Virginia school district's policies. While the administration argued that the guidance is allowed because the use of the word “sex” in regulations implementing Title IX is ambiguous, O'Connor disagreed. “[T]he Court concludes § 106. 33 is not ambiguous,” he wrote. “It cannot be disputed that the plain meaning of the term sex as used in § 106. 33 when it was enacted by DOE following passage of Title IX meant the biological and anatomical differences between male and female students as determined at their birth. ” Of the administration's guidance purporting to change that “plain meaning,” then, he added: “A definition that confuses instead of clarifies is unpersuasive”  —   citing the judge who dissented from the 4th Circuit's decision for support. In granting the states' request, O'Connor issued a nationwide injunction of the guidance, writing that “while this injunction remains in place, [the Obama administration is] enjoined from initiating, continuing, or concluding any investigation based on [its] interpretation that the definition of sex includes gender identity in Title IX's prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex. ” O'Connor also ordered that the administration not use the guidelines or claim that they “carry weight in any litigation initiated following the date of this Order. ” “The department is disappointed in the court's decision, and we are reviewing our options,” Justice Department press secretary Dena Iverson told BuzzFeed News. Although Iverson would not signal either way, the administration is expected to appeal. Paul Castillo, a   lawyer with that LGBT advocacy group Lambda Legal, told BuzzFeed News he believes an appeal is “widely expected. ”In the short term, Castillo thinks the injunction will prevent federal officials from threatening to withhold federal education funds from schools that ban transgender students that match their gender identity. However, he added, “It will not prevent private attorneys, such as Lambda Legal and the ACLU, from representing transgender students by bringing cases against schools that discriminate against them. ” He said other LGBT groups could file lawsuits as well.

"," We all know the Classic Makeover Montage well. A beautiful actress we're supposed to believe is a homely slob because her hair's a little frizzy is bestowed with a flatiron and some makeup  —   after a parade of product placements, she's the belle of the ball. There is perhaps no feminine transformation as famous as the one in John Hughes' The Breakfast Club, that gold standard of high school movies and launcher of a thousand teen cliches. Ally Sheedy's Allison goes from Hollywood's idea of a gross, greasy basketcase to pretty in pink under the guidance of a queen bee played by (who else) Molly Ringwald. An unattractive weirdo is effectively cured when she becomes beautiful in the eyes of teenage boys. Netflix's   horror series Stranger Things, the breakaway hit of the summer, is a hefty homage to '80s genre films  —   and since repackaging tropes was always going to be part of the plan, a Classic Makeover Montage was inevitable. Directed and written by creators Matt and Ross Duffer, Stranger Things follows the aftermath of a boy named Will Byers' disappearance in 1980s Indiana. His friends  —   a motley crew of uncool, Dungeons  Dragons —  playing middle school boys  —   attempt to find him with the help of an escapee from a government facility, who has been groomed into a telekinetic weapon. The escapee's name and approximate age is Eleven. Played by a very talented Millie Bobby Brown, Eleven is   scrappy, loyal, and brave. Her hair is completely shaved, since the government experimenters who raised her were constantly attaching and reattaching   nodes to her head. Her imminent makeover, therefore, is different than your basic       —   she was raised in a brutal and presumably genderless way by force. But a makeover is a makeover. Will's friend Mike (Finn Wolfhard) in whose basement Eleven has sought refuge, helps her put on his older sister's makeup and clothes so she can take a trip to their school without rousing suspicion. The end result  —   frilly, feminine, pink  —   has Eleven looking like a miniature version of Ally Sheedy, brand new and beautified, emerging from Saturday detention with the Brat Pack. Eleven touches her new blonde wig in front of a mirror in Mike's house. “You look pretty,” Mike tells her. “Pretty?” she asks, not sure whether to believe him. It's a word she'll repeat a few times throughout the series  —   gazing at her reflection, seeing the way Mike looks at her. While she struggles to comprehend other words the boys introduce, “pretty” is one that Eleven understands immediately and intimately. She was robbed of an entire childhood, but having been denied prettiness seems to be one of her short life's greatest sadnesses. Eleven is at home in a long history of young female characters whose ultimate worth is dictated by her romantic appeal to boys  —   someone who must first become desirably feminine before she can fully claim that worthiness at all. That premise is all the more galling in a show where Eleven is a) the hero, and b) prepubescent. Why on earth does she need to be worrying about attracting boys when she's a literal child  —   one preoccupied with saving people in mortal danger, no less? Even though Eleven didn't make the choice to shave her head, Stranger Things presumes that the   is girlhood's default, a natural and obvious preference. To be   pop culture tells us, is to be weird, abnormal, ugly, bad (in another word: queer). Prescribed femininity is therefore a  : If a girl can be pretty, she can be available to men. And in 2016, as in the '80s, a girl is still supposed to be both. Boyish girls remain rather rare in mainstream film and television. When they do show up, their boyishness tends to be a problem to be corrected. Sometimes a tomboy's masculinity is merely temporary, a costume to be put on and taken off  —   like with Andrea, played Alana Austin, in the Disney movie Motocrossed: she dresses up like her twin brother to race as him, inspiring the lesbian awakenings of so many '90s kids. As with Amanda Bynes in She's the Man, Motocrossed's girl ends up safely femme and partnered with a boyfriend by the time the credits roll. In other cases, masculinity in girl characters can be attributed to their sportiness, but the films have to work extra hard to assure that  —   don't worry!  —   even though the girl is tough and strong, she's still pretty and sought after by boys. In 2002's Bend It Like Beckham, Keira Knightley's   and tomboyish Jules, a soccer player, is continually suspected of being a lesbian, particularly by her mom Jules continually denies the accusations, which becomes one of the film's running jokes. Despite an insane amount of chemistry with her best friend and teammate Jess, played by Parminder Nagra, viewers are constantly hit over the head with the apparent fact of Jules' heterosexuality, particularly when both Jules and Jess somewhat inconceivably fall for their male coach. Then there are the   girls who are just one of the boys, a bro among bros. In another John Hughes —  penned '80s film, Some Kind Of Wonderful, Mary Stuart Masterson is Watts, a working class teen tomboy who's BFFs with Eric Stoltz' Keith. Watts helps Keith try to land a popular girl, the way a good wingman does, but in the end Keith realizes that he's actually in love with his best friend  —   which he expresses by giving Watts a pair of earrings originally intended for the girl he'd been pursuing earlier. Watts is thrilled. What    tomboy doesn't covet a pair of expensive, girly earrings? If a girl's masculinity can't be corrected with compulsory femininity, she's a lost cause: the butt of a joke at best, something monstrous at worst. Queerness  —   which could encompass a character's sexuality, or simply be signified by a deviant gender presentation  —   has been demonized throughout horror film history. The monstrous queer has cropped up in everything from   films like Silence Of The Lambs and Monster to ‘80s slasher movies, inciting highbrow and lowbrow terror in near equal measure. Just as queerness in any shape or form is a threat to heteronormativity, a figure like Dracula is a threat when seducing the men and women he preys upon, whom he renders  —   through penetration and the exchange of bodily fluids  —   just as villainous as he is. Eleven in Stranger Things isn't a threat the way a lot of classic horror villains are, but what matters is she sees herself that way. When experimenters force her to push the bounds of her telekinesis, she unwittingly creates a tear in space and time, opening a gate to an alternate dimension (“the Upside Down”) which leads a monster out into the real world. As days pass and Will Byers still hasn't been found, Eleven is wracked with unspeakable guilt. “I'm the monster,” she tells Mike, tears pooling in her eyes. Her monstrosity, she feels, is made visually apparent by her shaved head  —   she's defective, something hideous and unlovable. In one scene, after she's run away from Mike and his friends, worried that she could hurt them or otherwise make matters worse, she leans down over a pond in the woods and screams at her reflection. If only, if only she were normal. If only she were pretty. Stranger Things, which references the work of directors like Steven Spielberg and John Carpenter, borrows ‘80s film aesthetics to marvelous effect  —   but it also borrows absurdly outdated gender politics, which are a lot less fun to watch. Eleven is defined almost exclusively by her relationships with men and boys: the evil doctor she calls “Papa” the group of geeks who go from rejecting her to defending her and, most significantly, with her friend Mike, who, after seeing her properly girlified, gets a crush on her, kisses her, and asks her to a school dance. Even though Mike still likes Eleven without the wig, which she's thankfully abandoned due to impracticality by the end of the season, her makeover allowed him to see her as someone capable of femininity, rather than just another bro. Regardless, why must any sense of her empowerment or validation come from the way a boy sees her? (And, reminder: These kids are in, like, sixth grade. They are babies.) Eleven's heroism  —   and ultimately, her potential martyrdom  —   is overshadowed by her downgrade from   victor to mourned love interest. On the whole, Stranger Things makes sure to scrub all possible traces of queerness from its characters. Bullies pick on Will, his brother, and his friends by calling them queer freaks, but that's largely an empty insult. Mike is safely paired with Eleven, while Will's brother, Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) after taking enormously creepy photos of Mike's older sister Nancy as she's undressing in a window, becomes her confidante and friend. Lonely hetero geekdom is romanticized in this world  —   stalking is merely a minor offense, something that very well might be less shameful in the show's diegesis than gayness. Stranger Things champions the nerds and the weirdos, as so much of '80s pop culture did, but the writers temporarily put Eleven in a wig and make most characters seemingly straight as if to assure that their weirdness won't become unruly. Queerness,   (nonwhiteness too, for that matter)  —   in a world with monsters and alternate dimensions, these things are just too alien to make the cut. Not every character in the world needs to be LGBT. (That'd be nice, though.) The issue isn't just that there are no queer characters on so many beloved and critically acclaimed shows  —   the issue is that most characters aren't given the opportunity to be anything other than straight or  . Even female characters on TV who are actually allowed to be   openly queer are overwhelmingly feminine: Emily and her various love interests on Pretty Little Liars Clarke and her various love interests on The 100 basically everyone on The L Word (Shane's the one   exception, and she wears a ton of makeup). Lea DeLaria as Boo on Orange Is The New Black is one of the only true butches on television today. If a female character is going to be into women, she at least has to “look straight” so her queerness isn't too much of an aberration. When characters we're supposed to root for step outside the bounds of heteronormativity, so often they're forcefully shoved back into place. But Eleven is a kid. We don't know her sexual orientation and we don't need to. Yet the Duffer brothers felt compelled to give her a makeover and stick her with a boy. (She might have grown up to be with both boys and girls, of course, or no one at all, but in our culture girls are presumed straight unless proven otherwise even then, they're belittled and disbelieved.) No matter her orientation, Eleven simply doesn't deserve to be reduced to a romantic plotline with anyone. Even though Winona Ryder made a triumphant comeback as Will's mom, even though Natalia Dyer's Nancy can (wow!) shoot a gun pretty well, and even though #WeAreAllBarb, Stranger Things exists squarely in a boy's universe. And according to the laws of pop culture, boys still get to complete their heroic quest and win the girl. Another huge hit of the summer, Paul Feig's Ghostbusters, has been widely celebrated precisely because the female characters aren't winnable. They exist in their own right, as fucking badasses who save the world, instead of prizes for male protagonists' consumption. It's an exciting thing primarily because women deserve to be the heroes of their own stories. But keeping all the female characters unattached also means that Ghostbusters doesn't blanket enforce heteronormativity. Kristen Wiig's Erin gets awkwardly flirty with Chris Hemsworth's Kevin, but Melissa McCarthy as Abby is far more concerned about her friendship with Erin (and catching ghosts) than expressing romantic interest in anyone. Meanwhile, Kate McKinnon's Holtzmann seduces everything that moves (notably, in a way that doesn't simply perform for the male gaze). Ask any lesbian and she'll tell you that McKinnon's character is so obviously queer that they left the Ghostbusters theater even gayer than when they walked in. Both Feig and McKinnon won't confirm Holtzmann's sexuality, likely due to studio pressure, which is maddening in its own way. But at the very least, Holtzmann  —   who is far from the most feminine person in the world, in her neckties and whimsical overalls  —   isn't punished for her masculinity, or saddled up with a random dude. Holtzmann's rise comes one year after another female character was afforded similarly refreshing, and rare, freedoms: Charlize Theron's Furiosa in Mad Max: Fury Road. After Millie Bobby Brown, the actor who plays Eleven, shaved her head for the role, she was worried she'd made a big mistake  —   until the Duffer brothers showed her a picture of Furiosa rocking the same cut. “The resemblance was amazing!” she told IndieWire. “It was the best decision I've ever, ever made. ” The more we see women and girls embracing nontraditional gender presentations, the less vilified those presentations will become. Characters like Furiosa and Holtzmann represent the possibility that a woman could be masculine, or queer, or unattached, or some combination of the three without being forcibly feminized, given a boyfriend, or branded a monster. Stranger Things could have easily allowed Eleven to forge meaningful friendships and kick monster ass without preoccupying her with fears about prettiness. Some tropes of the ‘80 really aren't worth reviving  —   the Classic Makeover Montage is one of them.   "

","'Read the opinion:'] WASHINGTON  —   A federal appeals court on Thursday rejected a woman's claim that existing civil rights law protects against sexual orientation discrimination  —   ruling that only the Supreme Court or Congress can make that the law. “Kimberly Hively has failed to state a claim under Title VII [of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for sex discrimination,” the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals held in its decision in Hively's appeals. “[H]er claim is solely for sexual orientation discrimination which is beyond the scope of the statute. ” In ruling against Hively's claim  —   that sexual orientation discrimination should be barred under Title VII as a type of sex discrimination  —   the court, primarily, pointed to a series of rulings from the appeals court beginning in 1984 and continuing through 2000 in which the court found that   discrimination was not covered by Title VII. A clearly conflicted Judge Ilana Rovner, joined by Judge William Bauer, went on for more than 40 pages, however, detailing what Rovner described as “a paradoxical legal landscape in which a person can be married on Saturday and then fired on Monday for just that act. ” Addressing the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's 2015 decision  —   backing up Hively's position  —   that sexual orientation discrimination is a type of sex discrimination barred under Title VII, Rovner wrote, “The idea that the line between gender non‐conformity and sexual orientation claims is arbitrary and unhelpful has been smoldering for some time, but the EEOC's decision   …     threw fuel on the flames. ” In the wake of the EEOC's decision, Rovner acknowledged that “the district courts —  the laboratories on which the Supreme Court relies to work through cutting‐edge legal problems —  are beginning to ask whether the sexual orientation‐denying emperor of Title VII has no clothes. ” She even acknowledged the fundamental correctness of the EEOC's logic: It seems illogical to entertain gender non‐conformity claims under Title VII where the non‐conformity involves style of dress or manner of speaking, but not when the gender non‐conformity involves the sine qua non of gender stereotypes —  with whom a person engages in sexual relationships. And we can see no rational reason to entertain sex discrimination claims for those who defy gender norms by looking or acting stereotypically gay or lesbian (even if they are not) but not for those who are openly gay but otherwise comply with gender norms. Nonetheless, Rovner concluded that the 7th Circuit should extend its prior decisions unanimously concluding that sexual orientation discrimination is not barred under Title VII, given that Congress has repeatedly rejected legislation to expand protections to include sexual orientation discrimination explicitly and the Supreme Court has declined to address the issue. “Perhaps the writing is on the wall,” Rovner wrote of a change, but concluding, “Until the writing comes in the form of a Supreme Court opinion or new legislation, we must adhere to the writing of our prior precedent. ” Judge Kenneth Ripple joined in the portion of Rovner's decision holding that Title VII does not include sexual orientation protections, but not the extended discussion on the EEOC ruling and emerging law on the viability of drawing a distinction between sex discrimination claims and sexual orientation discrimination claims.

"," This summer, I paid $22 to make my face look like a freshly glazed doughnut. For weeks, Glossier, an   beauty startup with a fanatical following, had been hyping a face highlighter called Haloscope by referencing Krispy Kreme's      look (“warm on the inside, a little wet and sculpted on the outside”) in its ad copy. How had I never noticed that Original Glazed has a   glow? The desired effect is less glistening carb than Karlie Kloss on her way to barre class  —   i. e. someone more likely to Snapchat fried food than to eat it  —   but the analogy was endearing nonetheless. Twenty days after Haloscope was released, Quartz, the pearlescent pink shade, sold out. That's nothing compared to the waitlist for Boy Brow, Glossier's eyebrow pomade, which famously climbed up to 10, 000. Before restocking last month, Glossier had 60, 000 names on waitlists for its nine skin care and makeup products, which the company releases in limited collections every few months. In the two years since Glossier launched, it has hired 44 employees (many of whom double as models) and raised $10. 4 million in venture capital financing over a seed and series A round. Revenue, meanwhile, is on track to grow 600% in 2016, and the company expects to grow several hundred percent next year as well. Fashion and beauty blogs now cover the company's font choice, packaging, product launches, and inevitable product sellouts like Apple fanboys awaiting WWDC. More than 267, 000 people follow the brand on Instagram. Its signature   pink has become so iconic that fans use the hashtag #glossierpink when they see the color in the wild: on a surfboard, a San Francisco Victorian, a mural in India, “aura crystals,” a rosy cocktail at a rooftop bar in Chelsea. According to Emily Weiss, Glossier's    founder, most customers come from    and fall into the enviable    age bracket. Glossier has fans in Kloss (whose Instagram selfie sporting a branded sweatshirt got 27, 000 likes) and in Eva Chen, former    of Lucky and current head of fashion partnerships at Instagram (who calls the brand “phenomenal”) and, probably, in the most effortlessly luminous young woman in your office, group text, or Twitter feed. The brand quickly ascended to cult status through a curious alchemy of market research, calculated intimacy, and the ineffable coolness of its founder, figurehead, and often model, Weiss. A magnetic former fashion assistant at W and Vogue, she had a brief but memorable stint on The Hills as an uptight “super intern,” flown in from NY as a foil to Lauren Conrad's West Coast casual work ethic. While she was still at Vogue masthead, Weiss started the beauty and fashion blog Into the Gloss, known for a column called “The Top Shelf,” which features interviews with    It girls, revered magazine editors, future   muses, models, entrepreneurs, and the occasional heiress, some of whom spilled the secrets of their beauty routines while Weiss sat on their bathroom floor. Glossier used the community that formed around the blog to create a dossier (hence the name) of skin care and makeup for consumers to build out their own top shelves. “It was never a pivot,” Weiss told me during a recent visit to her office in lower Manhattan. The move from Into the Gloss to Glossier, she explained, was “a total evolution of the same mission, but with tactile content. ” Sure, but not every blogger's move toward “tactile content” could be so seamless. In order to make her pitch to the masses, Weiss has had to reposition herself not as the super intern who knows the makeup secrets of the stars, but as your best friend or benevolent big sister. In her letter introducing the company, Weiss said she wanted to welcome everyone. “Snobby isn't cool, happy is cool,” she wrote. Part of the thrill of being a Glossier girl is the proximity to Weiss, her   workforce, and her company's hella 'grammable Soho headquarters. She is one of a cohort of aspirational founders of   startups in NY City  —   including her good friends Leandra Medine of Man Repeller and Sophia Amoruso of Nasty Gal. Sitting in a   conference room wearing a pair of vintage white Levi's that she picked up on her honeymoon to Tokyo, she resembles a Nancy Meyers version of a millennial girlboss: beautiful but not too intimidating, appreciably ambitious but almost always smiling, neurotic  —   but in a charming way. After sitting down to our interview, Weiss got up immediately to straighten a rack of postcards behind me. “Sorry,” she said, “it's going to drive me crazy if it's crooked. ” Glossier's office looks like its Instagram account come to life. The white walls are covered in ethereal mood boards in dreamy pastels. Wooden chairs are outfitted in chic fur shrugs.    arched windows look out safely at the cityscape below. The lacquered conference table is long, lean, and  . And on every floor, employees radiate good health and subtle highlighter. This is the kind of office where an administrative coordinator or   engineer can, and does, double as a model for the company's Instagram account, FaceTime tutorials, and Facebook Live videos. On YouTube, Glossier hosts a feature called “Get Ready With Me,” where the person (often a Glossier employee) walks the viewer through their morning routine. On a recent summer day, the office was buoyant over big news: The company had just restocked its lipsticks and concealers, which combined had a waitlist 30, 000   customers long. They celebrated for a few minutes with cupcakes covered in stiff pink frosting with miniature replicas of the sleek Generation G tubes on top, as well as breakfast parfait cups and   breakfast sandwiches. The cupcakes got Instagrammed, but not the sandwiches. Perfect for a Snapchat story, one employee told another as they walked away from the table, fancy cupcakes untouched. To understand what makes Glossier popular, start with its sales pitch. The line promises a barely there,    effect that plays up features instead of masking flaws, though of course this works better when your “flaw” is a cute scar, winsome snaggletooth, or freckles  —   not cystic acne, purple   bags, or a hirsute chin. Words like “imperceptible” and “sheer” pepper the site's ad copy, and aside from its lipsticks, a newer addition, Glossier's products aren't really meant to be noticed at all. “We always err on a light touch versus a heavy touch,” Weiss explained, meaning “there's never going to be some kind of explosion: ‘Oh my god, I've overdone it! There's too much product  —   I have to wipe some off. '” Haloscope definitely can't be overdone, I told Weiss  —   believe me, I'd tried. “It's hard!” she replied, smiling. “It's so subtle. If anything, the criticism would be that our products are too subtle than too intense. But I think that's so important to be able to build. So few of us are makeup artists. We want the products to be universally flattering, to be very intuitive, very easy. ” None of the products require brushes it's all designed to be slapped on in the back of the cab. “Glossier is makeup for the truly lazy” was The Frisky's assessment, but make no mistake  —   laziness in this case means studied effortlessness, not puffy and   six hours deep into a Netflix binge still caked with the remnants of last night's mascara. The look is “trying hard but not trying to look like you're trying hard,” said Munachi Ikedionwu, a blogger and Vanderbilt University premed student. Palm trees and   coconuts are a recurring motif on Glossier's posters and stickers, which come free with every order. Packages arrive in a brown box with that   interior, plastered with slogans like “SKIN FIRST. MAKEUP SECOND. SMILE ALWAYS” and “SKINCARE IS ESSENTIAL. MAKEUP IS A CHOICE. (MAKE GOOD CHOICES). ” Inside it, the makeup itself comes in a bag made of pink bubble wrap that doubles as a clutch so cute the company sells them à la carte, three for $12. Website copy is just arch enough not to sound too 13 Going on 30: “The      in you is freaking out right now,” declares the description for Generation G Boy Brow's implores you to “Brush your teeth, brush your brows, and then maybe brush your hair. ” Packaging channels the hopeful futurism of the '80s (“as opposed to the the whole '90s   thing,” executive editor Annie Kreighbaum said, “which is not so cool for us”). To hype Haloscope, Glossier flooded its Instagram with pics of a shimmering tulle skirt cascading down a runway, a   horse on a beach, and of course, doughnuts. If the references are familiar to you, it feels whimsical as fuck. A teenage daydream, elevated and commoditized. A series of coded signals for a certain kind of girl. “The people seeing Sofia Coppola movies, they're also buying Glossier,” said Natalie Guevara, a    who works in communications for the   startup Genius. “It's very much taking the Coppola aesthetic  —   the dusky pink and supple skin  —   and making it something tangible that you can buy. ” It's a far cry from the heavy colors and oozing lipstick logo for Kylie Cosmetics() or even Milk Makeup, which goes by the slogan “cool girls get ready quick,” and traffics in     products that offer effects like “an iridescent,   sheen” or “  color in one swipe. ” Glossier never explicitly says whether these are the bad makeup choices it warned you against, but its aesthetic is subdued and refined, more Connecticut (where Weiss grew up) than Calabasas. Glossier girls probably keep up with the Kardashians, but they don't want to look like them. The products themselves tend to be   . Glossier's concealer feels impossibly light and looks incredibly natural, even if it settles into fine lines. Milky Jelly is a   treat, but doesn't remove my mascara. I'm not entirely sure Haloscope is visible on me, but when I put the products on in the morning I feel destined for a compliment. Surely all this radiance will turn some heads. At any rate, the Coppola comparison is real: Weiss gave the director one of her lipsticks and then Instagrammed a handwritten   note. Coppola loved the shade Crush. Glossier typically gets lumped in as a startup because it “launched” on Instagram, but that was just a savvy promotion strategy. People had to leave the app to buy the goods, and the company still had to set up a website, buy dynamic online ads, and advertise in the subway just like every other   hopeful. Glossier's real innovation was optimizing for the internet at every step: using the tools of the social web to turn readers into followers and followers into brand evangelists, unpaid product advisers, and, maybe, something like a community, albeit one that buys things from you. “We really want to listen very closely to our audience across all our channels,” Weiss told me. That means talking to customers through FaceTime videos and Instagram comments, and using Into the Gloss's robust commentariat as an updated take on a focus group: The formula for Milky Jelly Cleanser, a nonfoaming, ultralight face wash, came largely out of a post titled “What's Your Dream Cleanser?” in which Weiss encouraged readers to answer that question, “   stories encouraged. ” “We will do our best to compile what you tell us into one helluva Glossier cleanser,” Weiss wrote 382 comments and almost a year later, Milky Jelly was released. Power users are invited to sign up for a special, confidential Slack group. NY —  area ones are invited to the Glossier penthouse for “a night of mystery product testing, pizza, rosé, and g. IRL talk with other members of the Glossier community and CEO and Founder Emily Weiss!” If in 2016 brands are your friend, Glossier wants to be your BFF. (Or at least talk like her.) The nondisclosure agreement doesn't come until later. “Copy plays a huge part,” explained Kreighbaum. It's important to be “personable and   . You can have ‘real girls,' but if you're not being casual with your language, it gets lost. ” Kreighbaum became a social media star in her own right after her lush, unrepentant eyebrows were featured prominently in campaigns for Glossier's Boy Brow product. “Maybe my eyebrows are more famous than I am? I hear they do well on our paid ads,” she told me. She was a beauty blogger before Weiss recruited her through a Twitter DM. “I think they thought I was funny. A lot of beauty writing didn't have as much personality,” said Kreighbaum. “It kind of comes naturally to me to overshare. ” Indeed, there's something intimate and cliquish, almost conspiratorial, about the brand. “You're part of this crowd and you don't want to stray from it too much,” said Claire Carusillo, a    beauty blogger who puts out a charmingly unhinged newsletter called My Second or Third Skin. In other words, even if Balm Dotcom, Glossier's   salve, is essentially   Vaseline, pulling a tube out on the subway still feels good. “When you get really hyped about something, you kind of lie to yourself,” Carusillo told me. “Like, ‘This is the stuff! '” Perhaps tellingly, Glossier sells nine beauty products and four items of merch, including an enamel pin in the shape of the company's signature gothic “G” ($14) and the very sweatshirt Kloss took viral ($60). “Ordinarily, I just buy stuff off of Amazon and the drugstore,” said Guevara, the Coppola fan. “In many ways, Glossier is one of the first brands that I've subscribed to. When Boy Brow runs out, I order more. ” It's all part of the contemporary dance between consumers and   companies, in which the brand is never supposed to look like it's selling something, and people buying it roll their eyes if the artifice grows too lame. “Trying hard to not look like you're trying hard” doesn't just describe the Glossier look, it describes the company's whole corporate ethos, from its chatty, familiar ad copy to the gap teeth on its “real girl” models.   makeup is a perfect complement to   commerce. “It doesn't feel like we're being sold products  —   it's much more like a lifestyle play,” said Chen, comparing Glossier to Supreme, the widely worshipped streetwear apparel company. But where lifestyle purveyors like Supreme try to stay a   secret as long as possible, Weiss has pulled off a feat of branding gymnastics: She's taken   signifiers and made them seem accessible to the masses, and she's created a Glossier girl whose definition is broad enough to include anyone with $12 to spend on a lip balm, but particular enough that it still feels exclusive. Take Glossier's recent Instagram post advertising a   shop in Amagansett. (Spelling out “the Hamptons” might look basic.) Or the company's “soothing face mist,” a   and   water that promises to “hydrate, soothe, and leave you feeling fresh and awake. ” No one needs to spray flower water on their face, but at $18 for a bottle, it's an attainable kind of indulgence. All in all, the Glossier's cheapest item is $12, and the most expensive is $26  —   more than drugstore brands, but less pricey than much of the stuff you'd find at Sephora. Folu Akinkuotu, a    Boston resident who works in business development for an   company, said she became a Glossier customer precisely because because of that calibrated accessibility. It's big departure from Into the Gloss, which featured the kind of people who “buy containers of La Mer cream once a week   …     Cool. That's my rent. ” Glossier, she said, is different. “It's not snapshots from this movie star's bathroom. It's like, ‘Here, this is for you. '” Guevara also found the blog inaccessible, but stressed that the vibe at Glossier's   stores in downtown Manhattan have been very different. At an event in January where Glossier sales clerks were dressed in lab overcoats so chic that attendees asked where they could buy them, Guevara said “there was something about it that was very sort of homey. ” “I would kind of eyeroll at that kind of scene if it was held at Barneys,” she continued. But “there was no shame if you want to come in just to Snapchat or take selfies. ” Kirsten Green, the founder of Forerunner Ventures, one of Glossier's first investors, described Glossier as “democratic in its offering, while still being cool and practical, not making a bunch of promises [but] celebrating who you are. ” And Glossier fans like Chen will tell you about the exquisite specificity of the world that the brand created, but never give details when you ask for  . Kreighbaum said there's no archetype of the Glossier girl: “I think it's more important to us to be your friend. ” At the company's office, Weiss told me that Glossier's goal is “to make women proud of where they're at every day. That can mean you're on your way to getting promoted but you haven't gotten promoted yet and that's okay. Or you know you just broke up and you're sad and crying and that's okay. We want to kind of feel all the feelings, you know what I mean?” In person, Weiss's voice has a sturdier timbre than you might expect from her delicate frame. She's luminous and slight, but authoritative in the breadth of her knowledge about the industry and Glossier's game plan. Her lower jaw juts out when she smiles, which she does often, and she has the warmth and pep of a coach on the sidelines. If she'd asked me to take a knee in front of a mood board, I would have. “Emily Weiss was this sort of figurehead to me,” said Carusillo, who started reading Into the Gloss in college. “She's so beautiful. She seems to have a really gorgeous life. I looked to her for so many years as a     cool girl. ” This spring, Medine was photographed at Paris Fashion Week carrying one of the little pink bubble wrap pouches that Glossier uses to cushion packages during shipping. A month later, Jimmy Choo offered its own version of the bubble wrap bag for $950. In the notoriously hierarchical fashion world, Weiss and her cohort get   seats at shows and walk the occasional red carpet. Buying Glossier products is an entrée into this world, into a fantasy plane where Emily Blunt from The Devil Wears Prada wants to give you the keys to the fashion closet  —   before she started eating carbs again. But there's a reason movies don't center around the cool popular girl who is also nice and helpful: It's hard to make that believable. Weiss' brand of accessible coolness is a fitting mood for our age of nascent   when a teen girl's bible is Rookie, not Seventeen cover girls can also be activists and, for a while at least, a   gazelle like Taylor Swift could position herself as the awkward outcast. The fashion industry scouts talent directly from Instagram these days, and so does Glossier. The result is a rotating cast of ethnically diverse and genetically blessed models whose full lips and youthful glow  —   and, of course, taut frames  —   would give you   whiplash on the street. But that outward emphasis on diversity didn't save Glossier from an uproar in the fall of 2014 when the company released its Perfecting Skin Tint in only three shades (the “dark” was still pretty light). On the message board Get Off My Internets, one commenter wrote that she loved a recent “Top Shelf” feature on Into the Gloss featuring a   woman. “[I]t felt like acknowledgement that black girls get to play in the ‘pretty girls club' too. So the three shades was a slap in the fucking face. ” Weiss and her team tried to assuage ITG readers who brought up the same complaint, explaining that a broader range of skin tints was already in the works. And the company did better than bounce back. Shoppers whose skin doesn't match the beauty industry's definition of “nude” can use Glossier's shade finder tool or watch quick videos on the product pages of Glossier. com showing women with an array of different skin tones demonstrating more shades of the skin tint in natural light. Reflecting the widest array of shoppers is good business  —   after all, exclusivity has a   cap on consumers. The more people who feel like part of the pretty girl club, the more makeup Glossier can sell. In a post for xoVain, beauty editor Tynan Sinks tried to untangle why he has such a personal connection with the brand. “[M]aybe it's because Glossier feels inclusive, like any of us could be a cool Glossier girl,” adding, parenthetically, “all I've ever wanted to be is a cool girl, but the sad truth is I'm just a   bitch. ” Wouldn't you know it, Glossier even has a slogan for that exact state of mind: “Everyone says they're ‘low maintenance.' (It's okay, neither are we. )” Even the line's critics admit that the branding is on point. On Makeup Alley, a secretive message board for aficionados, one commenter wrote: “I don't rly get the glossier hype its like, they took all the most raved about products on intothegloss and just duped them. ” But, the poster added, “in cute packaging. ” The way Weiss tells it, Glossier sprang organically out of Into the Gloss's community, but the company also smartly positioned itself at the nexus of a few big trends. Search for “no makeup tutorial” on YouTube and you'll find almost 2. 6 million videos “natural makeup tutorial” gets 1. 2 million results. Korean beauty, which emphasizes flawless skin above all else, is booming stateside in 2015, South Korea exported more than $2. 6 billion of cosmetics goods, up from $1 billion in 2012, according to the BBC. Glossier was ahead of the curve, but the number of products to help women look like they woke up like this could fill a Sephora. At the same time, Glossier was one of the first in a new wave of beauty brands built to float in a viral soup of YouTube tutorials, “Instagram makeup,” influencers, and beauty bloggers, where skeptical millennials with no brand loyalty can find a   guide or product review on just about anything. Specialty chains like Sephora and Ulta are winning out over department stores, which works in the favor of newer, smaller brands. When Kendall Jenner was named the new face of Estée Lauder in late 2014, the company called the social media sphinx “the ultimate instagirl. ” Macy's, which launched in 1858, is currently worth $4 billion less than Ulta, which isn't even a decade old. “It used to be you needed to have footage inside a big store,” said Karen Grant, beauty analyst for NPD Group, a market research firm. “Now you just need a following. ” When Weiss was out fundraising, investors wanted to compare Glossier to other   brands  —   e. g. “the Warby Parker of x. ” “We got to a point where we had to say no,” Weiss told me. Glossier wasn't selling online in order to offer a price cut or incentives like promotions or subscriptions. “We're using the channel to build a better brand, period. We're using the channel to actually involve the customer in ways she's never been allowed or invited to become involved [in order] to build an incredibly inclusive movement like a better, more modern brand, which is going to become default. ” Subtract the buzzwords, dial down the egalitarian   and Weiss has a fairly novel concept. Armed with all the intimate intel gleaned from so many comment sections and Slack groups, Glossier has carved out a niche for itself in the new lane of   consumer goods that feel luxurious because they're customized to your needs. Weiss likes to use the phrase “redefining luxury” to describe an individualized experience that caters to the customer. “If you go to a Hermès store or something, you hope they remember you from your last  …    ”  —   Weiss struggled to come up with something  —   “$10, 000 purchase? I dunno. ” But websites can do that through cookies. “Luxury today is getting what you want, how you want it, when you want it, getting a very personalized experience,” Weiss continued. Uber started out under the branding of “everyone's private driver”  —   another version of the “what you want, when you want it” line. Silicon Valley investors pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into meal delivery startups for the same reason. If you're looking for a lucrative exit, it's a good time to be in   right now. “The major brands are making an effort to gobble up” smaller companies, said Grant. The market is shifting quickly to adjust to millennial buyers (  creams are out, highlighters and contours are in) YouTube stars, and Korean beauty. Investors have heeded the call. Last winter, Ipsy, a subscription service like Birchbox   by social media mogul Michelle Phan, raised $100 million. In July, Goldman Sachs and Bain Capital acquired a controlling stake in Carver Korea, which makes specialty   cosmetics. And earlier this month, Memebox, an   platform for   products, raised $66 million from tech investors. Memebox deals with Korean manufacturers, who are known for producing   cosmetics with a fast turnaround. Glossier, on the other hand, traffics in a small line of products that are released slowly and sell out quickly. The company experimented with 40 different formulas for Milky Jelly, instead of the more typical three or four, before settling on the same gentle cleansing ingredient found in contact lens solution. Almost a year passed between Weiss's original   post and when the product was available online. That's awfully slow compared to ColourPop, the Los Angeles —  based company behind Kylie Jenner's lipstick line, which uses the fast fashion model to create “on trend products that are amazingly of the moment at record speed. ” The company works with several chemists, but would not disclose their names, saying it was “beauty industry standard to keep that information confidential. ” Glossier was also   about production and would only divulge that it's actively working with six product manufacturers across North America, although needs change depending on new formulas or categories. And Milky Jelly sold out, as almost all of Glossier's products do at some point or another. (“The waitlist thing has been really  …     It makes us so sad when we can't give people what they want. Period,” said Weiss when I repeated the beauty blog rumor that the sellouts were a sales gimmick. Kurt Jetta, founder of the research firm TABS Analytics, referred to the industry's obsession with selling out as engendering “borderline hysteria. ”) But even if Glossier is not the brand to scale affordable luxury in cosmetics, the underlying idea is still an intoxicating proposition for people whose demands outstrip their disposable income. It's an inch closer to the consumer power shift toward buyers that the “thinkfluencers” have been talking about for more than a decade. Just imagine if you could tell Trader Joe's that you really wanted chocolate chips in your cookie butter, but with less fat and more viscosity. Or ask J. Crew to offer more lightweight cardigans and fewer sequined pineapple ruffles. And then the company (kinda) listened! And sold you something (sorta) like that? Consumers want customization everybody wants to be heard. Green, who sits on the board of Bonobos and Dollar Shave Club as well as Glossier, said that her investment thesis relies on this concept. Amazon has already won on price and convenience. And the abundance of choice has pushed   to adapt from the “  format” of the   era. “The way that our lives digitally are evolving, it's almost like we can have a real relationship with people via technology, and the expectation is that you can have that with brands, too. ” There's the friend request again. The morning that I visited Glossier's office, Weiss, Kreighbaum, creative director Helen Steed (who's also filled the same role at Bumble and Bumble and Jawbone) and Adriana Deleo, the company's head of design, were gathered to look at the results of a new photo shoot the pictures were ultimately used to promote the fact that all five shades of its Skin Tint were back in stock. Kreighbaum was wearing a taupe dress that looked like an oversize   hoop earrings, and black sandals with chunky heels and thick crisscrossing straps. On the poster board were photographs of radiant girls, including an Asian woman, an Indian woman, and a black woman posing in plain white tank tops in front of a blue background like angels from American Apparel heaven. The Indian woman, Alisha Bansal, is a student at Barnard who interns at Christie's. Another was a Glossier intern. “They're all real girls. A lot of them we found on Instagram from tagging us in their selfies because they use our products,” said Kreighbaum. (Her trick to scouring Instagram: tagged photos, which give a more realistic idea of what someone looks like.) According to the market research firm L2, “Brands are not yet seeing the same post fatigue on Instagram as they did on Facebook  —   followers are not becoming disengaged with more brand content. ” But that only works if commerce stays hidden and companies post and share like a person. (This is also why every brand on Twitter wants to be your lit pizza bae AF.) If Glossier is your friend, it follows that the brand's social media and ad campaigns would include photos that look like ones your friends would take. Instead of using DSLRs to shoot campaigns, “we're transitioning to shooting stuff more on the iPhone,” because it's more natural, said Kreighbaum. And rather than traditional shots, the company tends to show off new items using Boomerangs and videos, so, in the words of Chen, “it feels like they're communicating with their audience the exact way the audience consumes on Instagram. ” Glossier retouches its photos, but minimally, according to Kreighbaum and Weiss. “If a retoucher did what they would normally do, it would feel so flat,” Kreighbaum said. “I think that's why people take a second look at them, because they're so raw in comparison. ” Kreighbaum said that when they build out a world for campaigns, they try to make sure “nothing is too fantastical. ” Others will “build this set of a bathtub filled with flowers, wind through the hair. ” With Glossier, it's more like, “Oh, our friend has a cool bathroom, let's shoot there. ” She didn't elaborate on how many of Glossier's customers have cool bathrooms themselves. Weiss still gets asked about The Hills, which has now been off the air for a decade. I started following Glossier purely out of fascination with the icy intern who tried to make hero LC look bad. But when I watched it again, I felt worse for Weiss. Her reality TV crime was knowing too much. “It was totally true what they portrayed in terms of me being hardworking,” said Weiss. “But in terms of me being an antagonist, they kind of had their production hat on to create this dynamic. I was just trying to impress my boss. ” Weiss claims to have mellowed out over the years. “It's funny because I was super serious. As a    in work scenarios, I just wanted to do a great job,” she said. “Now I'm just older and I like to operate [differently]. For example, our company couldn't be further from the fashion magazine environment. ” Behind Weiss, the mood boards and trendy young women were visible through the glass conference room wall. She continued: “I think I'm just more chilled, and it probably doesn't hurt that I am the boss. Now I just want to impress my employees. ” This winter, Weiss wrote a post about the many, many things she did to get ready for her wedding. (Jezebel seized on the colonic part.) Isn't that antithetical to the whole “be happy where you are” thing? “I would actually argue that,” she replied, warmly. “It's very easy to say that this is the opposite of Glossier,” Weiss explained however, “Glossier is not saying that everyone should be low maintenance. Glossier is about not shaming however you interpret beauty. Glossier is for the girl on YouTube who has a   beauty routine and leaves the house with a full face of makeup every day because that's how she feels best. And it's for someone who puts on moisturizer and leaves because that's how she feels best. ” How did I end up with a soliloquy on  ? I have no idea, but I found myself nodding along. “Does that make sense?” she asked. “You should do whatever it is that makes you the most happy, and so before a wedding, I mean, yeah,” she said, as though it were only natural. She took it even further. “I love the conversation that that created!” Weiss said. “There are people who said, ‘Wow that is so crazy high maintenance,' and there are people who said, ‘Wow, I did 10 times that! '” “Emily is one of those people whose brain works on a different kind of plane,” said Chen. “You know how hummingbirds fly at a different velocity than other birds? Emily's brain is that way, where she's four to six steps ahead of everything. ” However Weiss's brain is vibrating, it appears to be working. The company doesn't yet ship internationally, but Guevara said she's even encountered it in the Dominican Republic, where she grew up. Friends “arrange for family members in Miami to receive shipments, which is crazy. ” They discovered the brand on Instagram. ●  "
73618,110169, Facebook Must Either Innovate Or Admit Defeat At The Hands Of Fake News Hoaxsters,Buzzfeed News,Craig Silverman,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/how-facebook-fell-into-a-fake-news-trap-of-its-own-making
"," It's taken nearly two years, but this week clearly showed how Facebook's approach to battling fake news has failed. Only a fews days after the company laid off the human editors who managed its Trending Topics and related news articles, a false story about Fox News host Megyn Kelly became a top Trending Topic on the platform for nearly 24 hours. Facebook's algorithm saw the story was being widely shared and talked about so it added it to the trending sidebar, thereby promoting the false story to potentially millions more people. It's not a surprise that a false story was trending in the first place. A research project I conducted in 2014 found that false rumors and hoaxes attract more engagement on Facebook than the related debunkings. This is particularly true when it comes to fake news items, which are hoaxes published by websites that look like real news sites but are created to fool people. The data I found showed that fake news could drive massive numbers of likes, shares, and comments on Facebook, while any attempts at debunking it would receive a fraction of the engagement. (Remember that Facebook is now the biggest driver of traffic to news websites.) For example, this October 2014 hoax claiming the Earth will experience six days of darkness had racked up nearly 900, 000 likes, shares and comments on Facebook. The combined Facebook interactions of seven different debunkings from places such as Snopes and the Huffington Post amounted to a little more than 136, 000. Nearly two years later, fake news sites continue to flourish on Facebook. Just look at the two Canadian teenagers I found who are making thousands of dollars just from hoaxes about Justin Trudeau. Or this coordinated effort to seed fake articles about terrorist attacks in Facebook groups in order to drive people to malicious websites. Fake news sites are now also joined by a new breed of   websites and Facebook pages that generate huge engagement on Facebook with content that's often false or deeply misleading. One of these sites, EndingTheFed. com, published the false Megyn Kelly article that Facebook made a Trending Topic. This is all happening close to two years since Facebook announced it would enable people to flag content in their News Feed that was false or deliberately misleading. The goal was to blunt the impact of fake news. It failed. Then, yesterday in Italy, a student asked Mark Zuckerberg if Facebook sees itself as an editor when it comes to news on its platform. “No, we are a tech company, not a media company,” he said. These three things  —   reliance on users to flag fake news, firing Trending Topic editors in favor of an algorithm, and Zuckerberg's insistence that Facebook is not a media company  —   together show how Facebook has been caught in a fake news trap of its own making. The company is faced with a choice to either innovate or admit defeat at the hands of fake news hoaxsters and   click farmers. Here's why: Facebook insists it's not a media company, which means it does not want editors making calls about what is and isn't news, or choosing which sources to highlight. So goodbye, human editors. People at Facebook have also told me they do not want to blacklist even the worst of the fake news websites, since that in their view is akin to editorial oversight and censorship. (The company is probably even more wary of blacklists after its Trending Topics editors were accused of suppressing conservative websites.) Meanwhile, Facebook is fine with users flagging fake content, but there's no evidence people are doing this to any useful degree  —   and in fact this feature can easily be used as a weapon to silence people. All of this means Facebook's only option  —   and clear preference  —   is to develop an algorithm that uses signals gathered on its platform to determine which topics should be labeled Trending, and which articles within those topics should be highlighted. This needs to happen while also making sure the algorithm identifies and eliminates fake, false, or defamatory topics and stories. The flaw with this current approach is Facebook itself. The algorithm has a huge reliance on signals such as the likes, shares, comments, and reading time that a posted article gets  —   and when it comes to news, Facebook is incredibly biased. The false story about Kelly is a perfect example. Ending the Fed publishes highly partisan content that is often totally false or misleading. But it's precisely because of how partisan it is, and because of the way it writes headlines and packages its content for Facebook, that it gets huge engagement on the platform. False content often gives off great signals on Facebook. John Herrman wrote about the rise of these   political websites and Facebook pages for the NY Times Magazine. They all take advantage of the fact that people are more likely to positively engage with and share information that aligns with their beliefs. Echoing what the    kid running a profitable fake news operation told me, these sites tell people what they want to hear. Or, more accurately, they aggressively and divisively cater to existing beliefs and keep people in a filter bubble, often thanks to information that is false or incredibly misleading. This kind of content quite literally makes people feel good when they read it because it reinforces what they believe. And so they like it, and share it, and email it to friends, and post enthusiastic comments about it on Facebook. Then their friends with the same beliefs do the same. Any Facebook algorithm looking for news stories with strong engagement signals is going to surface these stories, and they are going to look great. The algorithm might check how many other sites have published a story about the same thing  —   multiple sources, right!  —   and it will find lots of other articles, because   sites and fake news sites constantly republish (or steal) each other's content. There's a good chance the copycat stories may be doing well on Facebook, too. That's how total bullshit gets to the top of Trending Topics, courtesy of an algorithm. And why it will probably happen again and again. Facebook's   approach inevitably falls victim to the biases of the platform, which themselves are a reflection of our own human biases. It's ironic that one solution is to apply more humans to the problem, but the Trending Topic editors had previously proven fairly effective at keeping fake stories off the sidebar. At this point, it's possible that Facebook may decide Trending Topics isn't worth the effort and controversy and will kill the product. There is, however, one alternative positive scenario I could see unfolding as a result of Facebook's doubling down on the Trending Topic algorithm. If the company is truly committed to offering a quality Trending Topic (and News Feed) experience, then its only option is to make massive strides in the detection and analysis of the factual qualities of news articles. Developing what would likely be the world's first algorithm to do this job with accuracy and consistency will require significant engineering resources. But it's what's necessary to actually stop Facebook from being the world's biggest platform for false and fake news  —   and to get there without editors. Right now Facebook has no editors, a flawed algorithm, and a weak product. The past two years have seen Facebook articulate what it will and won't do when it comes to fake news. The question now is whether it actually cares enough to make its approach work.  "
73619,110171, Nextdoor Rolls Out Product Fix It Hopes Will Stem Racial Profiling,Buzzfeed News,Caroline O'Donovan,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolineodonovan/nextdoor-rolls-out-product-fix-it-hopes-will-stem-racial-pro
","'For example, try to post about your car windows being smashed, and you'll be prompted with this message:' 'Try to describe someone with just a racial characteristic, and you'll see this prompt, asking you to be more descriptive:'] Nextdoor, a   social network for neighbors that has more than 10 million registered users, is rolling out a new tool today that the company says has reduced incidents of racial profiling on its network by 75% during tests. In recent years, so many people have used Nextdoor to report things like black men driving cars or hispanic women knocking on doors as suspicious or even criminal that the site has become known as a hub for racial profiling. The new tool, an algorithmic form for reporting crime and safety issues, has been in beta for an   portion of Nextdoor's 108, 000 neighborhood groups since May. This feature, which automatically identifies racially coded terms and prevents users from posting without supplemental descriptors, goes live for all users today. “The impact of being racially profiled in general is terrible,” CEO Nirav Tolia told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday. “It runs counter to the mission of Nextdoor. It's something we feel morally obligated to take seriously. ” Racial profiling became an issue for Nextdoor in 2015, when a number of news outlets reported on the frequency of posts about crime or suspicious behavior that mentioned an individual's race, but little or nothing related to actual criminal activity. In many cases, these posts would refer to people of color doing things such as talking on the phone or walking a dog. Tolia said it wasn't the bad press, but the work of civic groups in Oakland that brought the issue to his attention. Nextdoor touts its collaborations with police departments, city governments, and other public agencies. Last fall, Oakland Vice Mayor Annie Campbell Washington encouraged Oakland city departments to stop using the app to communicate with citizens until Nextdoor addressed the issue of racial profiling. By October, Tolia's team was holding working groups with advocacy groups and city officials, and together they came up with a solution. The idea, which Tolia credits to members of a group called Neighbors for Racial Justice, was to change the way crime and safety issues are reported on Nextdoor. Instead of a blank text box and subject line, it was suggested that Nextdoor design a form that more closely resembles a police report or 911 dispatcher questionnaire. By explicitly requesting details about height, clothing, and age, they would discourage people filing reports from focusing exclusively on the race or ethnicity of the subject. Nextdoor features a wide variety of post categories  —   Classifieds, Events, etc.  —   but it's the Crime and Safety section where people tend to focus on race to the exclusion of other salient details. As of today, Nextdoor neighbors posting a “crime” or “suspicious behavior” to the site will be warned against allowing an individual's race to color their interpretation of events. And if their post focuses too much on the race or ethnicity of the subject, they'll be prevented from publishing it. “When race is invoked, we create a higher bar,” Tolia explained. Nextdoor claims this new   system has, so far, reduced instances of racial profiling by 75%. It's also decreased considerably the number of notes about crime and safety. During testing, the number of crime and safety issue reports abandoned before being published rose by 50%. “It's a fairly significant dropoff,” said Tolia, “but we believe that, for Nextdoor, quality is more important than quantity. ” Vice Mayor Washington said she's “thrilled” with the results Nextdoor has achieved. “I don't think a lot of technology companies would have taken the steps they did, and made significant changes to their platform,” she said. When tech companies come under fire for failing to take race issues seriously  —   Snapchat, Twitter, and Airbnb are examples  —   critics often assert that, were minorities better represented on the staffs of those companies, the same mistakes might not have been made. But Tolia, who himself identifies as a person of color, said that while he's working actively to diversify Nextdoor's staff, when it comes to racial profiling, “we believe we get the best information from our members, and in this case, our advisers. ” But not all of Nextdoor's advisers on the racial profiling project are satisfied with how the process turned out. Two founding members of Neighbors for Racial Justice, Audrey Williams and Shikira Porter, said Nextdoor left them out of the development process after a flurry of early interest. Porter told BuzzFeed News that she continues to see instances of racial profiling in her Nextdoor neighborhood despite the rollout of the form. Nextdoor confirmed that the company has not met with Neighbors for Racial Justice since the test pilot began in April, but said it was made aware of only two instances of racial profiling that had slipped through its algorithms in the last few months. “We've been doing the work of consultants for them, and they've been taking it as free,   volunteer advice from the community,”said Williams, who works in digital marketing. “And we've been happy to give it, because it makes our lives better. But over time, it began to feel a bit like exploitation. ” Nextdoor will hold a conference call for local stakeholders on Wednesday, but neither Williams nor Porter will be able to attend. Porter said it “didn't feel right” to have Neighbors for Racial Justice attached to a project they felt the organization hadn't been given a chance to sign off on. “We appreciate working with [Neighbors for Racial Justice] to create these improvements,” said Tolia in a   email. “We are encouraged by the progress, but know there is still more work to do. ” However, it's clear that the contributions of Neighbors for Racial Justice and other local organizations to Nextdoor's efforts were integral to the design and execution of the final product. Some of the copy Nextdoor ended up using in the form  —   such as, “Ask yourself, ‘Is what I saw actually suspicious, if I take race or ethnicity out of the question? '”  —   came at the suggestion of Neighbors for Racial Justice. The new racial profiling form isn't the only change Nextdoor has made in service of tempering racial profiling on its platform. Last November, the company introduced a checkbox that allows users to flag posts for racial profiling. More recently, it's trained the group of   customer service representatives that reviews such posts in conflict resolution and “cultural humility” with an eye towards helping users understand why their posts were flagged, and how racial profiling negatively impacts whole communities. It's unusual for a tech company to take such an active role in policing its users, or to make an investment in educating them about social and cultural issues. In addition to relying on community members, Nextdoor also hired consultants to help, among other things, define what racial profiling outside of a police setting even is. Debo Adegbile, a civil rights attorney with the NAACP who was nominated for US assistant attorney general by Obama, and Grande Lum, a race relations expert with the Department of Justice, both worked as advisers to Nextdoor. Because the new form makes it less likely that users will post to Nextdoor, Tolia said there's a “business cost to doing this. ” But given the way Airbnb, Twitter, and other tech companies have struggled with issues of race in recent months, it's easy to see Tolia's decision to meet the racial profiling problem   not just as morality, but also as good business sense. “Let's not be fooled,” said Audrey Williams of Neighbors for Racial Justice. “It's a win for us, and it's a win for them. ”  "
73620,110172, These Two Dads Almost Lost Their Son In A Bizarre Surrogacy Case,Buzzfeed News,Tamar Lewin,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/tamarlewin/wisconsin-surrogacy-case
"," Jay Timmons and Rick Olson, a married gay couple from Virginia, didn't think they'd have any trouble becoming the legal parents of the baby boy their surrogate, a Wisconsin woman, delivered for them last year. They had gotten the frozen embryo that became their son as a gift from straight friends whose in vitro fertilization created more embryos than they could use. They had chosen a Wisconsin surrogate specifically because the state's Supreme Court had upheld surrogacy, and other   couples had had smooth sailing there. And by just about any measure, the two intended fathers were prime parent material: They both had good jobs, they had been together for 25 years, and they were already raising two daughters from previous surrogacies. But their careful plans went awry the month before their son, Jacob, was born, when their effort to be named his legal parents landed before a conservative judge who saw surrogacy as a form of human trafficking. Over the next 11 months, the couple's bizarre legal battle cost more than $400, 000 and kept them in constant terror of losing their son. “We didn't have one night's peace,'' Timmons, 54, a conservative Christian and president of the National Association of Manufacturers, told BuzzFeed News. “We'd wake up absolutely panicked, around 2 in the morning, and talk about the fact that we didn't know what was going to happen. ” The couple took out second and third mortgages to cover the legal fees, and Olson, 49, quit his job as a federal lobbyist for Capital One to manage the proceedings. Over the last couple of years, a handful of   surrogacy lawsuits have cropped up in U. S. courts. In California, a surrogate named Melissa Cook refused a man's wishes to abort one of the triplets she was carrying for him. And in a Pennsylvania, The View   Sherri Shepherd tried, unsuccessfully, to pull out of a contract with a pregnant surrogate after splitting up with her husband. But the Wisconsin case is likely unprecedented, legal experts say, in that the surrogate, her husband, and the intended parents were all happy with their arrangement. Only the judge was not. The case was a “judicial hijacking,” Melissa Brisman, a surrogacy lawyer in New Jersey, told BuzzFeed News. “We're at a time when a lot of people are still very committed to the idea that family values means straight married couples who have sex are the only ones who should have babies. ” In June the couple won the case, thanks in large part to the judge's abrupt resignation. Although the proceedings had played out in closed court, once it was over, supporters of Timmons and Olson provided copies of court transcripts, briefs, and filings to BuzzFeed News. And although the case is certainly an anomaly among the thousands of surrogacy arrangements made in the US every year, it underscores how, in certain areas of the country, surrogacy has become a flashpoint for cultural debates about   marriage, reproductive rights, and the booming fertility industry. Dane County Circuit Court Judge Jim Troupis, appointed by Gov Scott Walker last year, opened his March opinion with the statement, “Human trafficking comes in many forms. ” And although he went on to describe the two dads as a “spectacular set of parents'' who would raise the child “in a nurturing environment with unmatched financial resources,'' he made it clear that he was bothered by the fact that the couple had paid a woman to carry a baby who was not related to them. “The fundamental fact remains that another couple has provided the child as a gift to the petitioners, and the child has no genetic relationship to the petitioners,'' Troupis wrote. “In order to bring the child into world, the petitioners have paid a significant amount of money. Without those payments there would be no child. '' Surrogacy is unquestionably expensive: Even before they ran into trouble and began accruing bills from a dozen different lawyers, the Virginia men paid $35, 000 to their surrogate and another $12, 500 to the Wisconsin agency that arranged their contract. Some people see these arrangements as selling babies, or exploiting poor women's bodies. But others, including many feminists, say women should be able to use their bodies as they please. There is no federal law on the subject, and state laws vary enormously. California, for example, where Timmons and Olson hired the surrogates who delivered their two daughters, is the center of the nation's surrogacy industry, thanks to a friendly state law. But most states don't have any surrogacy laws on the books. Some simply refuse to enforce surrogacy contracts. Others, including Virginia, don't allow surrogacy unless at least one of the intended parents has a genetic connection to the baby. NY and Washington allow only unpaid, or “altruistic” surrogacy, and Michigan has criminal penalties for all types. “We're not getting any closer to a national consensus on the subject,'' Naomi Cahn, a family law professor at the George Washington University Law School, told BuzzFeed News. “And it's not just a split between red states banning it and blue states supporting it. ” Despite the legal limbo, because of the rise of in vitro fertilization  —   now responsible for nearly 2% of US births  —   and the legalization of   marriage, demand is also rising for surrogates. And, partly to avoid legal snags, these women are generally “gestational surrogates,” meaning that they carry embryos that are not genetically related to them. According to the CDC, there were 3, 432 gestational surrogates in 2013, up from 727 in 1999. Timmons and Olson say they were not thinking much about adding to their family until their friends asked if they wanted their two leftover frozen embryos (only one of which survived). The California surrogacy agency that had helped the two men get their daughters was no longer in business. So they researched the various state laws and chose Wisconsin because it allowed   marriage and had a state Supreme Court ruling upholding surrogacy contracts where they are in the best interests of the child. The Wisconsin proceedings started smoothly. Their agency, Pink and Blue Surrogacy and Fertility of Waterloo, found them a surrogate. And before Jacob was born, Judge Sarah O'Brien, who was filling in to cover a vacancy on the county court, issued an interim order giving them parental rights, which would become permanent once the baby was born and had a birth certificate. Jacob was born Aug. 17, 2015, but by that time, the case had been transferred to Judge Troupis, who had recently been appointed to the court. He nixed Judge O'Brien's order, and appointed an independent lawyer to represent Jacob's interests in the proceedings. Although the case was in Dane County, the liberal stronghold that contains Madison, Judge Troupis appointed as the child's legal guardian Mark Knutson, a lawyer 70 miles away whose radio broadcast, The Word on The Law, aims to reconcile God's word with the law. Knutson, in turn, brought in another lawyer from his firm, Erik Krueger, who had worked with Liberty Counsel, a group that defends public officials like Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to   couples. Timmons and Olson were for the most part allowed to keep Jacob at their home in Virginia, although at one point, Timmons had to stay in Wisconsin with Jacob while Olson and the girls returned to Virginia for the start of the school year. Rather than following the first judge's lead, and formalizing the couple's parentage rights on Jacob's birth certificate, Knutson insisted on   legal proceedings. Instead of conducting informal interviews with Timmons, Olson, the surrogate, her husband, and officials from the surrogacy agency, Knutson required them all to testify at formal depositions. And while many surrogacy cases in Wisconsin do not involve an independent legal guardian, and those that do usually have fees of less than $1, 500, Knutson's bills topped $100, 000  —   to be paid by Timmons and Olson. In November, Knutson filed a   report to Judge Troupis, calling for more court oversight of surrogacy cases and arguing that   a gestational surrogacy contract made by two men with no genetic connection to the child would open the way to a dangerous expansion of the concept of parenthood. Such surrogacy contracts, his report said, broker pregnancy, commodify children, and meet the needs of wealthy intended parents at the expense of the children involved. And, he warned, they stretch the boundaries of parenthood beyond all recognition, almost to the point of creating a world, like the one in Plato's Republic, in which all children would be raised communally, with no special connection to their parents. “Plato's assertion that ‘no child should know its parent' once anathema to American jurisprudence, is not so different from paying for parental rights in this case,” Knutson wrote. In his March decision, Judge Troupis seemed to rely on many of Knutson's arguments. He terminated the surrogate's maternal rights and gave the Virginia men only temporary custody, technically leaving Jacob an orphan. Knutson declined to comment for BuzzFeed News, and Judge Troupis could not be reached through his law office. As news of the case spread, LGBT rights advocates were horrified. “This case is an indication of the work that's left to be done,'' said Emily   director of public policy at the Family Equality Council, an advocacy group that supported Timmons and Olson. “There's a sense in the gay community and among parents at large that now that we have marriage equality, all the issues are resolved, and   couples will be treated like everyone else, but that's not yet true. '' The Troupis decision left Timmons and Olson at a crossroads: They could continue to appeal in Wisconsin, or take a different route, pursuing an adoption in their home state of Virginia. While they weighed these options from their home in Virginia  —   while caring for Jacob and their young daughters  —   they had a lucky break: Judge Troupis resigned May 2, to try, unsuccessfully, for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Timmons and Olson had already moved to reopen and reconsider Judge Troupis's ruling, but with the judge's resignation, their case was transferred to yet another judge, Peter Anderson, who overturned Judge Troupis's “faulty'' opinion, which he criticized for using language that was “unduly harsh and kind of weird. '' Since their victory, Timmons and Olson have spent the summer fighting Knutson's huge legal bills, and going public with their story to try to prevent similar actions by rogue judges elsewhere. “Our biggest concern is that you had a judge ignoring the law, ignoring precedent, with intention to take Jacob away, or to torture us, based on his personal opinion,'' Timmons said. “We're using our voices to try to make sure this never happens to another family. ” 			Judge Troupis appointed as the child's legal guardian Mark Knutson, who in turn brought in another lawyer from his firm, Erik Krueger. An earlier version of this story swapped the two men's first names.			   "
73621,110175, This Woman's IUD Was Stuck For Two Weeks Because Her Catholic Hospital Refused To Take It Out,Buzzfeed News,Azeen Ghorayshi,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/azeenghorayshi/catholic-hospital-sued-over-iud
"," The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed two lawsuits against the Catholic Mercy Hospital and Medical Center in Chicago for refusing a bleeding woman critical medical care to remove her birth control device. The case is only the latest in a series of suits by the ACLU against Catholic hospital networks, which often deny reproductive care based on a set of religious rules that all of their doctors are required to follow. The rules, called the Ethical and Religious Directives, are set by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. In addition to banning abortions under most circumstances, even when the mother's life is in danger, the ERDs prohibit doctors from offering or discussing birth control options, certain prenatal tests, or sterilizations. “We're really concerned that the Directives are substituting the views of religious leaders for the needs of patients,” Jenna Prochaska, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Illinois, told BuzzFeed News. Mercy Hospital did not respond to requests for comment from BuzzFeed News. The woman at the center of the new suits,   old Melanie Jones, had fallen down on a wet bathroom floor, causing her copper intrauterine device (IUD) to get dislodged from her uterus. When she got to Mercy, she was in severe pain and bleeding heavily. According to the complaints, the doctor who saw her confirmed that the IUD was partially expelled and needed to be removed. On June 30 the ACLU filed two suits, one with the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights, and another with the Illinois Department of Human Rights. According to the complaints, the doctor refused to remove the device because Mercy's “Catholic initiative” prevented her from providing any care relating to the contraceptive device. Because the copper IUD is    —   and therefore is only used for pregnancy prevention and doesn't have secondary uses like easing cramping or heavy periods  —   the doctor said her “hands were tied,” the suit states. Jones was turned away and told to find a different hospital that offered secular care. “I walked away from the doctor's office feeling shocked and stigmatized,” Jones said in a statement released by the ACLU. “Hospitals and doctors' offices should be places for healing and not judgment. ” Jones then contacted her insurance provider, Blue Cross Blue Shield, which began the process of switching her to another provider. It took two weeks before she had the IUD removed. Her new doctor told her that she may have suffered cervical or uterine lacerations and possibly an infection, so did not immediately replace the device. The policies at Catholic hospitals affect many people. One in six hospital beds in the US is part of a Catholic institution. In Illinois, that number is closer to one in three. “Depending on where you're at in the state, there could be women who are geographically prevented from seeing secular providers, or can only see Catholic health care providers because of their insurance providers,” Prochaska said. Catholic hospitals have been expanding since the 1990s, but have picked up significantly in the last 10 years as more small clinics merge with large Catholic networks. “The Affordable Care Act has really brought in this new dimension where there's a lot of incentive to collaborate,” said Lori Freedman, an assistant professor of medical sociology at the University of California San Francisco who studies religious restrictions on reproductive care. “While they were already growing and merging and attaching the Directives to new hospitals, now we're seeing them attaching the Directives to clinics and other smaller institutions. ” As part of her research, Freedman has anonymously interviewed dozens of doctors who work within Catholic hospitals to understand how they balance providing quality medical care while also operating under the ERDs. Some doctors, she found, see the ERDs as just another kind of red tape. “But some of the doctors saw the Directives as very offensive and very upsetting. The feeling of having your hands tied was very common,” she said. But in Jones's case, she added, the ERDs may not have actually tied the doctor's hands, as there is no explicit rule against removing a birth control device. So the doctor's decision may have come from a general fear around ERDs, she said, rather than an edict from the bishops. “There's so many points in which the Directives have to be interpreted in practice,” she said. “I haven't heard a story like this before. ” In the last four years, the ACLU has filed at least nine lawsuits against Catholic hospital networks for denying women reproductive care. In 2011, a pregnant woman named Tamesha Means had her water break at 18 weeks. After she was rushed to her local Catholic hospital in Michigan, doctors refused to complete the standard procedure in such cases, which would have included terminating the pregnancy to protect the mother's life. Instead, they sent her home with painkillers. The next day, Means miscarried. The ACLU tried to sue the US Conference of Catholic Bishops on Means's behalf, but the suit was dismissed this June because the judge claimed he could not rule on church doctrine. He suggested that Means file an ordinary malpractice claim. (The decision is currently under appeal.) In Jones's case, like several others the ACLU has filed in the last few years, the organization has avoided the bishops and taken a different legal strategy: arguing that these hospitals are discriminating against female patients based on their sex. “Because Melanie is a woman who is trying to prevent pregnancy, she was told they would not care for her,” Prochaska said. “They could have provided the care, but they refused to for that reason  —   and they told her it was for that reason. ”  "
73622,110176, Doctors Are Upset About A Huge Change In Organ Donation Rules,Buzzfeed News,Nidhi Subbaraman,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/nidhisubbaraman/liver-transplant-list-change
"," About 7, 000 Americans every year receive a liver transplant  —   and with it, a new lease on life. But another 1, 500 on the waitlist die before they are matched with a donor. Now the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) the agency that decides which patients receive donor organs, is planning to change the way livers are distributed across the country. The current rule, which says that livers go to patients relatively close to where the donor died, has come under fire because it means that the chances of getting an organ can depend more on where you live than how sick you are. The new rule, if approved, would instead allow regions with a high proportion of organ donors, relative to their local waiting list, to send livers to regions with a lower proportion of donors  —   even if that means a   plane ride. The architects of the new model estimate that transportation costs could grow from $269 million per year to $345 million, and that an average transplant would cost $4, 700 more, but argue that the overall spending on transplant care would fall as more people became healthy faster. UNOS declined to comment on the cost, but said the method could save 52 additional lives every year. It would be the biggest revision to liver allocation rules since 2002. But transplant surgeons are in uproar over the proposal, which was released for public comment earlier this month. Critics say the new scheme will be expensive to implement and the logistics of   transport will nullify any small benefits for patients. Some question the very principle of redistributing available organs, and say it would be better to focus on recruiting more donors. “There's a relatively wide split in the liver community,” James Trotter, medical director of liver transplants at Baylor Scott  White Health, who opposes UNOS's proposal, told BuzzFeed News. “My personal belief is that it won't have a substantive impact on improving overall outcomes in liver transplant candidates. ” Organs are costly to transport over long distances and livers are only viable for up to 12 hours. So UNOS's allocation policy so far has favored local transfers within 11 designated “districts” in the continental US. Once a liver becomes available in a given district, a transplant recipient is chosen based on their “MELD” score  —   an aggregation of factors that indicates how likely they are to die in the next three months. The higher the score, the closer the patient is to death  —   or to the next liver that becomes available in their district. But this system creates a problem. “You do have to get much sicker in one part of the country than another to get a liver,” Ryutaro Hirose, professor in clinical surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, who chairs the UNOS Liver and Intestine Committee, told BuzzFeed News. Take Louisiana, for example, which has a relatively large pool of available organs compared with other states. Half the transplants performed there are on people with scores under 30  —   patients who are sick, but may be able to work from home, for example. But in southern California, most transplant recipients are in the ICU. “If we could instantaneously transport a liver from one area of the country to the other with a magical transporter, that would be the most fair system  —   but we don't have that and that's not practical,” Hirose said. The committee's new proposal, he said, sought to create something that would most closely resemble a single national list. UNOS's new system would erase some district borders, to create eight regions instead of 11. As a result, areas with more donors would supply zones in which there are more patients with higher MELD scores. (A similar geographic disparity happens with other types of organ donations. This spring, UNOS's Thoracic Committee suggested allowing sicker heart patients to qualify for donor hearts from farther away. That proposal also incited fierce debate.) Hirose said that depending on the public response to the new plan, the committee could consider another revision, and another session of public comment, before the proposal is put into effect. But critics like Trotter expect that the proposal will pass despite the laundry list of objections, among them the contention that the mathematics underlying the   relied on limited data. “My biggest worry is that this is not really going to change the problem  —   it's a little bit of a BandAid,” Daniela Ladner, associate professor of surgery at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, told BuzzFeed News. Ladner and her colleague Sanjay Mehrotra, a professor of engineering at Northwestern, have built an alternative distribution plan, one that they argue will save 85 lives every year  —   33 more than the UNOS's proposal promises. Also, the proposal that UNOS backs will not adapt easily to changing factors  —   such as more donors one year and fewer the next. They say UNOS is rushing to implement a suboptimal system while ignoring a potentially more effective solution. The Northwestern model, which is currently under review at a   journal, favors   distribution of organs that would allow transplant center and offices that already have relationships with their neighbors to draw on those ties. Instead of drawing hard borders, the Northwestern model would optimize matches across the entire country based on severity of illness and the distance to the donor liver. The UNOS proposal, for example, divides Tennessee in half, forcing offices in each side of the state to work with partners who are farther away. Mehrotra and Trotter point to this example as proof that the benefits of the model will not be worth the ensuing chaos. Another criticism is that the UNOS Committee did not invite the academic community or industry experts to propose alternative distribution models. Rather, the group settled on a new scheme first, then asked the transplant community for comment. Private shipping companies, for example, may have had good solutions, Trotter said. “What if you went to Federal Express and said, ‘How would you solve this problem? You're a    company whose entire business is focused on moving products around in the most rapid and efficient manner possible  —   what do you think? '”Richard Gilroy, medical director of liver transplantation at Intermountain Healthcare in Salt Lake City, Utah, is among those who oppose the idea of moving organs  . Gilroy has studied donor trends in the US and was part of the UNOS Liver Committee until earlier this year, but does not support the new proposal. A more effective, less chaotic, and potentially less costly solution, he said, could be to just recruit more donors in regions that are struggling with waiting lists. For example, Philadelphia has among the highest rates of organ donation in the country, whereas NY has nearly the lowest. “That difference shouldn't exist over 94 miles,” he said, and is likely due to differences in the way the two cities handle donor recruitment. This is not the first time transplant surgeons have spoken up. At a meeting last year, where UNOS presented the current proposal, a majority of the audience  —   surgeons and transplant professionals  —   opposed it in an informal vote. “After that it was like, why don't you burn it and start from scratch?” Timothy Schmitt, director of transplants at the University of Kansas Hospital, who opposed the motion then, told BuzzFeed News. If the new rule goes into effect, he expects the University of Kansas Hospital will perform fewer transplants over the next five years. In response, doctors are likely to simply inflate their patients' MELD scores to compensate. With the new proposal, he said, “we'd have more complexity, more costs, and more death. ” 			James Trotter is the medical director of liver transplants at Baylor Scott  White Health, not Baylor Health Care System.

","   Trump announced at a rally Thursday that he has tapped retired Marine Gen. James Mattis to become his secretary of defense, a pick that will require an act of Congress to allow him to take up the post. “We are going to appoint ‘Mad Dog' Mattis as our secretary of defense. But we're not announcing it until Monday so don't tell anybody,” Trump said to applause in Cincinnati. “They say he's the closest thing to Gen. George Patton that we have and it's about time,” Trump later added. The   general would join a team that includes retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security adviser and Rep. Mike Pompeo ( ) as CIA director. Known as “Mad Dog,” he was praised for his leadership in the 2004 Battle of Fallujah in Iraq, and Trump has described him as “strong” and “highly dignified. ” However, Congress will need to pass legislation to bypass a federal law requiring defense secretaries to have ended their service seven years prior to taking the position. Mattis, 66, retired as head of US Central Command less than four years ago. Before resigning, he went against Obama's national security team in pushing for a more hardline approach with Iran as they began work on the nuclear agreement  —   a deal Trump has blasted repeatedly on the campaign trail. He has also spoken against “ ” social programs in the military, chalking them up to political appeasements for a public that knows little about combat readiness. In a video interview with the Military Times, he warned against using the military “to lead social change in this country, especially social change that the country itself is not unified on. ” “There is no   right to victory on the battlefield,” he said. “You win that through the skill, and the devotion, the valor, the veracity of the troops. And you have to to be very very careful  …    that we don't undercut the military's battlefield effectiveness with   social programs. ”  "

The pilot's decision turned out to be a fatal mistake as the aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed into the Andes eight miles away from the airport, killing all but six passengers who survived the deadly crash. The flight took off from Santa Cruz, Bolivia, and was carrying members of Brazil's Chapecoense soccer team, which was scheduled to participate in the Copa Sudamerica finals in Medellin, Colombia. The aircraft was scheduled to land and refuel in Bogotá, but the pilot thought he had enough fuel for the trip, Gustavo Vargas, a representative for the airline LaMia told Pagina Siete, a Bolivian newspaper. Instead, the pilot radioed to Medellin's international airport from eight miles away, stating that he was out of fuel and was experiencing “total electric failure” in the aircraft, according to leaked recordings of air traffic communications. “The pilot made the decision not to enter (Bogotá airport) because he thought he had enough fuel,” Vargas told Pagina Siete. “We're talking about a pilot with a lot of experience who did his training in Switzerland. ” Vargas said the plane was an Avro RJ85 which, according to airliners. net, has a maximum range of about 1, 900 miles on a full tank, or just over 1, 300 miles with a maximum payload. “We have to investigate why he made the determination to go directly to Medellín,” Vargas said.

"," A year after a husband and wife pledged allegiance to ISIS and massacred 14 people in Southern California, key questions remain, including exactly why they attacked a workplace holiday lunch. Dec. 2 marks one year since Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik opened fire on the gathering of San Bernardino County health department employees, Farook's coworkers, in a conference room at the Inland Regional Center. The pair killed 14 people and injured 22 others before being fatally shot in a standoff with police several hours later. In the days that followed the attack, investigators shared details of how the    health inspector and his   wife became radicalized. They had acquired assault rifles, made their own explosives, and purchased tactical gear. Surveillance video showed Farook training with a rifle at a gun range several days before the attack. A Facebook post by Malik on the day of the attack connected them to terrorism, but no manifesto or written statement about their intent was left behind. Some answers have proven elusive: What was the exact motive? What spurred the radicalized pair to action? How did they spend their time between the shootings and the standoff with police? “There are questions that may never be answered,” FBI Los Angeles spokeswoman Laura Eimiller told BuzzFeed News. “We do believe they were planning for some time. ” On the day of the attack, Malik accompanied her husband to the Inland Regional Center, where he spent about two hours inside for a training and the holiday lunch. She waited in a rented black SUV with guns, explosives, and body armor. Farook left the festive gathering abruptly. A few minutes later, gunshots rang out  —   it seemed like millions, one woman told a 911 dispatcher. In a Facebook post, Malik pledge the couple's allegiance to the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr  . “We believe that's why the attack was carried out,” Eimiller said. But San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan told ABC's Nightline the couple would have had to look up the terrorist leader's name first. “I don't know that anybody can definitively say what was the catalyst that ‘today's the day,'” San Bernardino Police Lt. Mike Madden told BuzzFeed News. EXCLUSIVE: Pic shows San Bernardino terrorist posing with coworkers in front of Christmas tree before rampage:  …     https:  .  Photos obtained by ABC showed Farook posing with coworkers in front of a Christmas tree during the holiday luncheon. His participation in the celebration of   holidays had previously upset his wife, Madden said. While reviewing the couples' communications and social media posts, investigators found that Malik had previously said Muslims should not be forced to take part in Christmas celebrations. But as for the actual motive, “I don't know that we're ever going to know,” Madden said. Over the course of the investigation, the FBI and police have conducted 600 interviews, collected 500 pieces of evidence, and scoured the couple's online activity. A workplace iPhone used by Farook prompted a national debate over encryption and public safety. Ultimately, the FBI gained access to the phone's data, but it didn't provide any new leads in the investigation. The FBI is still asking the public to come forward with any information about the couple or their activities on the day of the attack. After fleeing the regional center, they returned  —   possibly to attempt to detonate an improvised explosive device left behind. “We have a gap there where we don't know where they were,” Eimiller said. Authorities are also still pursuing criminal charges against four people connected to the shooters. Trials are pending for Enrique Marquez, Farook's friend who prosecutors say helped him buy weapons, as well as Farook's brother, Syed Raheel Farook, the brother's wife, Tatiana Farook, and her sister, Mariya Chernykh, who are accused of marriage fraud. The investigation into the attack also remains ongoing. For those who survived the shooting, their families, and first responders, memories of the attack remain fresh and painful. “    days have gone by since last year,” said Madden, who was the first law enforcement officer at the scene. “Not a single one of those days have I not thought of that day to some degree. ” In the last year, Madden has moved into the role of spokesman for the police department  —   a position that has often required him to talk about how officers responded. “That part's been tougher than I thought it would be,” he said. “This was a horrible tragedy, but we also need to understand that we need to be prepared as first responders for these,” he added. “Ours wasn't the last. There's a very strong possibility there will be more, so we need to talk about it. ” A year later, he said he also thinks most about the victims: 14 dead, 22 injured, and countless more friends and family whose lives were forever changed. “We can't ever forget them,” he said. Going forward, Madden added he hopes for less anger and more unity. “Americans are very good at coming together as one in the face of tragedy,” he said. “We see it time and time again. ” But that goodwill, he said, fades too quickly. “We forget about the things that truly matter and the unity we are capable of. ”  "

","   Trump's   immigration agenda, which helped launch his campaign, flared again at his Thursday night “Thank You” rally. “We will restore the sovereignty of the USA. We will finally end illegal immigration, have to,” Trump told a crowd of supporters in Cincinnati, Ohio. “We will construct a great wall at the border. ” Trump said the beefed up border would “dismantle” cartels and stop the flow of drugs into the USA. He also pledged to stop the immigration of people from regions who can't be “safely processed. ” He wasn't the only one at the rally talking about undocumented immigrants, all of the speakers before him also mentioned the issue that was a cornerstone of Trump's successful campaign. Vice   Pence also promised to end illegal immigration, which set off chants of “Build the wall” from the crowd. Josh Mandel, state treasurer for Ohio, said people have been asking him to make cities sanctuaries for undocumented immigrants. “Over my dead body” will a city in Ohio become a sanctuary city, Mandel said, referring to jurisdictions pledging not to work with federal immigration officials on deportations. The call for sanctuary cities has reemerged after Trump's victory because immigrants and their advocates fear he will make good on campaign promises to deport millions. Since being elected, Trump said he would deport up to 3 million undocumented immigrants with criminal records. Trump's senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller, said Thursday that the   border has been left open for too long. “After all these years, after all this waiting, the prayers of Ohio and this country have been answered,” Miller said. “Starting in January 2017 illegal immigration will be a thing of the past and change is going to happen across the boarder. ”   "
74546,113425," After Trump's Win, Secure Messaging App Signal's Downloads Increase 400%",Buzzfeed News,Hamza Shaban,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161202095810/https://www.buzzfeed.com/hamzashaban/after-trumps-win-secure-messaging-app-signals-downloads-incr
"," Signal, the encrypted messaging app that comes with an Edward Snowden endorsement, has seen a 400% increase in daily downloads since Trump won the presidency. “There has never been a single event that has resulted in this kind of sustained, day over day increase,” Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of Open Whisper Systems, the software nonprofit behind Signal, told BuzzFeed News. Marlinspike interpreted the jump as a reaction to Trump's win, and anxiety over the future of US surveillance. The secure communications tool is   in technologists, journalists, and political activists' circles. It allows people to text and speak with one another using what's known as    encryption, meaning only the sender and their intended recipient can read or hear the message. “Trump is about to be put in control of the most pervasive, largest, and least accountable surveillance infrastructure in the world,” he said. “People are maybe a little bit uncomfortable with him. ” While Signal does not publicize the number of people who use it to communicate, its user base is in the millions, Marlinspike said. The Google Play store lists Signal's total Android downloads between 1 and 5 million. The app is also available on iOS and on desktop through Google Chrome. Conversations that are    encrypted protect individuals from the prying eyes of hackers and even from the communication platforms themselves. As this year's intense legal between Apple and the FBI showed, companies that offer    encryption can't read or produce the conversations of their customers, even when courts order them to. Marlinspike, whose organization aims to make encrypted communications simple to use and ubiquitous, said that some people might be installing Signal out of fear, while others are downloading it to protect vulnerable people who might be targeted by the government. Bruce Schneier, a prominent security expert, told BuzzFeed News he thinks more people are installing Signal because they are afraid their communications will be intercepted and read by others. “Privacy is essential to liberty and human dignity, and encryption is one tool for maintaining privacy,” he said. But the wider adoption of encryption is crucial to its success. “It's important that we all use it. If only political dissidents use encryption, then they can be identified in that way,” Schneier said. In an   calling for expanding US surveillance programs, Trump's pick for CIA Director, Kansas Representative Mike Pompeo, suggested that merely using secure encryption tools may call the attention of counterterrorism officials. “[T]he use of strong encryption in personal communications may itself be a red flag,” he wrote in the Wall Street Journal in January. In the same essay, Pompeo defended the government's ability to search Americans without a warrant, and the surveillance of social media posts. “I think there's a lot of fear, given Trump's alarming statements about surveillance and his penchant for revenge, that he will attempt to use surveillance to crush dissent and stifle journalism,” Trevor Timm, the executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, told BuzzFeed News. Trump's combative posture against the news media has concerned many journalists, whose work relies on collecting sensitive information and protecting the identities of sources. Timm said that conversations journalists have can be used by the government to identify and prosecute whistleblowers, and that reporters' emails and phone calls have ended up in indictments brought on by the Obama administration. For Timm, encryption has never been more important. “Since the election, our proverbial phone has been ringing off the hook from journalists who now see learning how to encrypt their communications and practice better operational security as urgent,” Timm said. “We're definitely going to be extremely busy in the coming months. ” Using the same technology that powers the Signal app, Google, Facebook, and WhatsApp have each released their own    encrypted messaging service this year. US law enforcement officials aren't happy about this and have described the rise of secure communications platforms as an obstacle to their ability to thwart crime and terrorism. But the prevailing view among Silicon Valley executives, computer scientists, and security experts, is that encryption is a crucial defense against an onslaught of criminal hacks, seemingly endless data breaches, and invasive government surveillance. During the election, Clinton's email controversy and the steady drip of WikiLeaks documents underscored the need for more secure digital communications in a time when relying on a permanent and searchable database of one's correspondence can easily lead to exposure, embarrassment, and harm. Mike Janke, the chairman of Silent Circle, a secure messaging platform that sells a suite of communication products to businesses around the world, told BuzzFeed news that sales increased 200% during the   period leading up to the election, after which sales leveled out. “We just know there was a lot of anxiety,” he said, describing the “unusual uptick” as caused by “something that happened in the world that creates a temporary  . ” He added, “This just happened to be the American election. ” In the past, sales upticks at Silent Circle have been triggered by news coverage of UK surveillance programs, and, on an even greater scale, the Snowden revelations. On the campaign trail, Trump sided with the Justice Department in its fierce dispute with Apple over gaining access to an encrypted iPhone, and he called for a boycott of Apple products until the company agreed to circumvent its own security features. At times, Trump has pushed for increased surveillance of Americans, including monitoring mosques. And during a CNN debate, he said, “[W]e should be able to penetrate the internet and find out exactly where ISIS is. ” Some in the tech industry see the new administration as a threat to their businesses and to the privacy of their users, since the data they collect about customers could be used against them. Speaking about the potential for the encryption debate to surface once again in Washington, Republican Rep. Darrell Issa told BuzzFeed News, “Our nation's liberties are more important than our nation's security alone. ” “We learned from the Patriot Act that things done in haste, or things done for security only  —   particularly when law enforcement says ‘give us all these additional tools'  —   will seldom make you significantly safer,” he said. While the Obama administration presented conflicting and contradictory positions on encryption, it's possible Trump would seek to undermine the technology behind Signal and other secure communication apps through legislation or future court battles initiated by the Justice Department. “It is troubling that   Trump has appointed some people that seem to have an overbroad view of governmental powers when it comes to surveillance,” Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu told BuzzFeed News. “And it is my hope that the new administration respects the Fourth Amendment and respects the importance of encryption  —   both for the government as well as for private individuals. ”  "
74547,113427, Instacart Is Being Sued By Its Workers,Buzzfeed News,Caroline O'Donovan,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161202095810/https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolineodonovan/instacart-is-being-sued-by-its-workers
"," Instacart is being sued by a group of workers  —   again. Brought by Arns Law Firm  —   the same firm whose class action suit against the grocery delivery company was thrown out last month over an arbitration agreement  —   the new suit was filed on behalf of six named plaintiffs. It alleges that people who worked for Instacart as independent contractors should have been classified as employees and are owed repayment for minimum wage, overtime, expenses and more. The class could include as many as 14, 000 workers from all over the country, the suit alleges, and the amount owed “far exceeds $5, 000, 000 in the aggregate. ” “The shoppers' and drivers' services are fully integrated into Instacart's business, and without them, Instacart's business would not exist,” the suit reads. “Instacart voluntarily and knowingly misclassified Plaintiffs and other Instacart shoppers as independent contractors for the purpose of avoiding the significant responsibilities associated with the   relationship. ” A spokesperson for Instacart said the company does not comment on pending litigation. The suit notes that Instacart did reclassify a portion of its workforce as employees in response to regulatory pressure. Since June 2015, Instacart workers who work exclusively inside grocery stores have been employees of the company only workers who also deliver groceries in their own cars are considered independent contractors. The suit argues that Instacart, because it did previously agree to reclassify some workers, “knew   recklessly disregarded that it was misclassifying its Shoppers from the outset. ” It also claims that the IRS and labor commissions in NY and Colorado back up this finding. In addition to the larger worker misclassification issue, the suit also touches on earnings. It alleges that online advertisements posted by Instacart promised workers could earn “up to $25 an hour,” though the company had enough data to know “it was impossible to earn that hourly rate consistently. ” The suit also claims that Instacart knowingly duped prospective workers. To support this argument, it points to a livestreamed August 2015   meeting in which “managers Susie Sun, Michelle Suwuannukul, and Heather Wake instructed Operations Associates to continue running the advertisements that represented that Instacart Shoppers could make a certain amount of money per hour even though they were aware that Shoppers were making an average hourly rate that was well below the advertised rate. ” In recent months, Instacart workers have clashed with management over changes to their pay structure. In September, the company replaced   tips (paid directly to individual shoppers who delivered an order) with a service fee that is pooled and distributed among workers at Instacart's discretion. As BuzzFeed News has previously reported, CEO Apoorva Mehta said the change is necessary to the companies continued growth. But   shoppers who shared their pay stubs with BuzzFeed News estimated the changes reduced their pay by between 30 and 40 percent. Frustrated workers have repeatedly threatened to strike and picket the company, and have been waging an informational campaign to explain the change to customers. The lawsuit brought against Instacart today cites the tip issue as proof that the company has a level of control over independent contractor earnings commensurate with that of an employer. It also argues that, per the Fair Labor Standards Act, any optional amount paid by a customer in addition to charges for a service should be considered a tip. For the plaintiffs in this newest suit, Instacart's arbitration agreement remains a thorny issue. The lawyers argue, as they did before the last suit was thrown out, that the arbitration clause workers agreed to when they signed up with Instacart should be considered irrelevant because of an August ruling by a judge in a separate case that set a new precedent on the issue of class action waivers. Companies like Uber and Lyft have both successfully used the threat of arbitration to push settlements of respective   class action lawsuits brought against them by drivers, suggesting the issue could still be an impediment to the workers' case against Instacart.

74548,113429, House Doubles Budget For Planned Parenthood Investigations Panel,Buzzfeed News,Ema O'Connor,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161202095810/https://www.buzzfeed.com/emaoconnor/house-doubles-budget-for-panel-on-infants-lives
"," WASHINGTON  —   Following a lively debate Thursday, the House of Representatives voted to add an additional $800, 000 to the budget for the congressional panel investigating Planned Parenthood, despite the fact that the committee may not exist anymore come January. The   panel, informally called the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives, will continue to investigate Planned Parenthood's use of fetal tissue and its connections to the tissue procurement agency StemExpress. But it's unclear whether the panel will continue in the next Congress which begins next year. Republicans on the panel accuse both Planned Parenthood and StemExpress of lying to women about what kinds of research fetal tissue can be used for in order to persuade them to have abortion. They have also accused Planned Parenthood of providing StemExpress with confidential patient information. Both organizations deny these accusations, though a Planned Parenthood consent form shows that the organization incorrectly stated that fetal tissue has been used to “treat and cure” Alzheimer's, cancer, and AIDS. The committee is the third iteration of congressional investigations into Planned Parenthood in response to last year's release of     videos made by an   advocate. The videos show Planned Parenthood employees discussing the process of procuring fetal tissue from abortions and transferring it to agencies and labs for medical research. All three of the committees  —   and thirteen state investigations  —   have sought evidence that Planned Parenthood and StemExpress profited off of the sale of fetal tissue, though none have uncovered wrongdoing. The latest panel subpoenaed StemExpress and its chief executive, Cate Dyer, and, in September voted along party lines to recommend contempt charges for Dyer, arguing that the company had not complied. Democrats disagreed and staged a walkout in protest of the vote, which did not advance to the House floor. The $800, 000 is “necessary funding to allow us to complete our work,” the panel said in a statement. They would not clarify further to BuzzFeed News what that work will entail and what exactly the funding will go toward. The panel will formally cease to exist once the 115th Congress takes over in January. But it is possible that it could take on a fourth form. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, a Democratic member on the panel, told BuzzFeed News that she thinks that with Trump in the White House another investigative committee may not be necessary. Republicans will instead pursue the many other “avenues” that just opened for them “to pursue their         education,  's health agenda,” Schakowsky argued, listing them on her fingers. In Thursday's House debate on the budget increase, Republicans touted the importance of their investigation by focusing on the rhetoric in the videos, with members calling the way the doctors spoke “callous” and “disturbing, horrific, and unacceptable. ” At one point, as Republican Congressman Joe Pitts of Pennsylvania described the “harvesting of baby parts,” a baby in the audience began to cry. The committee's Democrats countered by demanding that the House disband the committee entirely. They the investigations a “murderous witch hunt” that aims to “punish women, doctors, and scientists” and runs the risk of preventing “valuable scientific research” using fetal tissue to research cures for afflictions such as cancer, HIV, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's. Some Democrats argued that the panel is physically endangering abortion providers and patients by angering   extremists. Democratic congresswoman Diana DeGette mentioned the shooting at Planned Parenthood in her home state of Colorado, after which alleged shooter Robert Dear used rhetoric similar to the talking points used by Republicans and   advocates in talking about the videos. “The panel was supposed to be set up to investigate the sale of fetal tissue, but that didn't take,” DeGette said during the debate. “So may I ask, what the heck are we being asked to spend $800, 000 on? ”The budget approval brings the total amount spent on investigations for the panel to $1. 5 million. The doubling of the committee's budget comes shortly after Trump picked Rep. Tom Price  —   who supports defunding Planned Parenthood  —   to be his secretary of Health and Human Services. Democrats, in the meantime are gearing up for a fight. “We need to be ready for a real battle on these issues, including Supreme Court justices,” Schakowsky told BuzzFeed News following the vote. “I think it's clear that Roe v. Wade is at risk in this country right now. ”“But women are not going to go back, they will fight back,” she continued, “they will not go back to the alleys. ”  "

"," CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts  —   Every four years, the Harvard Institute of Politics puts on a campaign conference for the purpose of recording history. So we're all up here on campus, essentially in a conference room, followed by a dinner like you've been to in a hotel ballroom, and expecting something within the realm of a Harvard panel about journalism. But then. Moderator Sasha Issenberg Wednesday night at the Charles Hotel opened by reading off Les Moonves' infamous quote  —   the Trump phenomenon “may not be good for America, but it's damn good for CBS”  —   and asking each of his panelists how Trump was for business. First, Facebook's vice president of global communications Elliot Schrage. Then, Washington Post executive editor Marty Baron (good for traffic, “invigorating,” “challenging,” “trying” for reporters) and Associated Press executive editor Kathleen Carroll (“it was a challenge,” though the global audience was interested). Then, Issenberg turned and said, “So, Jeff, how good was Trump for CNN?” And then the audience actually laughed. So that's where things started. From there, the panel winded through everything from fake news to regrets to blacklists to how investigations were performed to how cable news covered rallies. All of it, however, especially from the dinner floor, carried through the anger  —   inside and outside the media, from both liberals and conservatives, from Trump fans and Clinton fans  —   at the media for doing this, for not doing that, for allowing this to happen. Afterward, I heard at least four people walk up to someone and go, “That was  …    interesting,” the way you feel out how game your   cousin is for talking about a wedding toast. Basically: The media panel was lit. And at the end  —   as serious as Baron and Carroll were  —   the core of the panel revolved around CNN, Zucker, and Trump, one of the dominating media stories of the campaign. “We're living American history right now, we've been living American history for the last 18 months,” he said. “It has been a   experience for CNN with Trump. It's    whether he's going to go after us. ” Zucker conceded as he has in recent months that the network and others aired too many Trump rallies early in the campaign, but also contended the last few months of the campaign  —   when “CNN sucks” became an extremely intense chant at rallies  —   indicated that CNN had provided both sides in its reporting and ultimately commentary. He noted that they paid contributors with campaign relationships on both sides. But the issue of the primary coverage caused the biggest blowup. “I would say in defense of the cable networks  …     This was early on, within a month, he was the frontrunner on the Republican side   …     and he was often making news at those rallies,” Zucker said. “Did we probably take too many of them live? Yes, I think we did. ” (Zucker also drew laughs a number of times, joking that he'd come to the realization that they'd aired too many rallies when he spoke at Harvard the last time.) “But I want to address something that I do know came up earlier, which is that many of the campaign managers said that they thought that it was unfair the amount of coverage and attention that Trump was getting,” Zucker said. “And I would respectfully push back on the campaign managers who spoke here earlier today, because, frankly, respectfully, I think that's bullshit. ” He said many of the same opportunities for interviews had been extended to other campaigns. And that's when Republican campaign advisers, including Rubio adviser Todd Harris, started heckling Zucker from the dinner floor. “I don't remember getting invited to call in, though!” called out Carly Fiorina adviser Sarah Isgur Flores. After some back and forth and a discussion and joke, it again came back to this issue. “My point is this: Cable news in general, and CNN in particular, should not be held responsible for the fact that Trump said yes to those interviews,” Zucker said. Again the heckling started. “It's not the interviews! This is, you know what, this is —  ” “You showed empty podiums!” “You showed hour upon hour of unfiltered, unscrutinized footage of Trump. It's not about the interviews. ” Again, more back and forth. “These other candidates were asked to come on and declined. ” “That's not true! That's not true!” chanted (other) people in the back corner. Even when they opened it up for questions, a student tried to get one over on Zucker by asking about the ethics of employing operatives as commentators, given the issues the network faced with, for instance, DNC interim chair Donna Brazile providing the Clinton campaign with primary town hall questions  —   then, at the end of the question, announced he'd give the mic to former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. That punchline didn't totally land, since when he handed over the mic, a grinning Lewandowski answered the question himself.  "

"," The Consumer Technology Association is a venerable,    trade group that puts on the Consumer Electronics Show, the annual product extravaganza in Los Vegas that draws hundreds of thousands of attendees. The association of more than 2, 200 corporations  —   and its president and CEO, Gary Shapiro  —   tends to give money to the traditional American party of big business, as you might expect. Yet this summer, as   presidential nominee Trump blasted   trade deals like the TPP on the campaign trail, the CTA switched gears. Shapiro  —   who described Trump as “unqualified”  —   and his organization enjoyed a   flirtation with the Democrats and its nominee, Clinton. But in the weeks since the election, Shapiro and others within the CTA have now twisted like a pretzel, publicly and repeatedly expressing optimism about the coming Trump administration  —   even if no one yet knows what his tech policies will look like, or how they'll shape the industry, other than to shake it up. “We are in the innovation world,” Shapiro told Buzzfeed News. “We adapt to change. That's what we do. We're tech ninjas. That means things change and you adapt. ” But there's adapting, and there's adapting as quickly as the CTA has: The organization sent out a congratulations to Trump before Clinton had even given her concession speech. That may be keeping a finger to the wind, or it may, according to Berin Szoka, president of the libertarian think tank TechFreedom, be a sign that the organization feels it is obligated to help mold Trump's inchoate tech platform. “From their perspective, there's no adult supervision,” Szoka said. “They're trying to play that role. They want to be at the table, and they're terrified of what would happen if this were left up to a strong   Valley contingent in the new administration. ” Whatever the reason, for Shapiro and the CTA, it's been a quick journey from a Republican to a Democrat and back again. Over the years, Shapiro has donated to mainstream Republicans such as Paul Ryan, Darrell Issa, and Roy Blunt. And the CTA's political action committee, to which Shapiro has given some $50, 000, financially supported John McCain in 2008, Mitt Romney in 2012, and Marco Rubio in the Republic primary in 2016. “We're tech ninjas. That means things change and you adapt. ” But then something weird happened: Trump broke with decades of   orthodoxy from the Republicans and crushed the Republican primary field. Along the way, he antagonized the tech industry and promised to gut   global trade agreements. “People are worried on trade,” Shapiro said. So Shapiro  —   and his organization  —   who had publicly supported Rubio, and were eager to preserve international trade deals with the Asian countries where most tech hardware is manufactured, found themselves in a strange position: With Her. And also, very, very much against him. Over the summer, Shapiro wrote a series of columns decrying Trump's protectionist rhetoric on trade, praising Clinton's tech policies, and fantasizing about a   Romney ticket that “Could Guarantee a Clinton Win. ” In a Reddit AMA, Shapiro described Trump as “unqualified. ” And two weeks before the election, Shapiro wrote a column in US News  World Report that concluded “Trump simply doesn't understand the modern economy. ” Then election day came and Trump won. And like a host of   Republicans who vowed never to do business with the   Shapiro did not exactly reiterate his opposition with force. Instead, his strong   stance seems to have lasted only a few hours after the results came in. On the morning after the election the CTA sent out a press release congratulating Trump on his victory, and citing the Republican majority in the Senate as “an opportunity   …     to rollback unnecessary rules, tackle   immigration reform, reduce patent troll extortion, lower corporate taxes and reduce spending. ” Later the same day, Shapiro wrote a column for Fortune entitled “How Trump Can Heal A Divided America Now,” in which he highlights Trump's “willingness to achieve goals through deals,” and suggests ways that Trump could modify the   Partnership rather than abandoning it entirely. A week after the election, the CTA put out another release, touting Trump's “Unique Opportunity to Advance IoT. ” And Tuesday, three weeks after the election, Shapiro wrote a column for Fox News outlining “Four reasons why our economy will thrive under Trump. ” While conceding that he voted for Clinton, Shapiro recommended that Americans “follow the lead of the initially jumpy financial markets and shift from doom and gloom to optimism. ” Shapiro nodded to the possibility of Trump raising trade tariffs on China or withdrawing from NAFTA, but concluded that “the stock market can and will be the   measure of his economic success. ” Last week, the CTA's Senior VP for Government Affairs Michael Petricone, speaking on Tech Freedom's policy podcast, said that “The mantra of our industry is that change is good. We're going to set an example here with CTA and the tech industry and move forward and find common ground with a new administration. ” Petricone went on to frame Trump's lack of a tech policy platform as a major opportunity for the industry. Funding for the CTA comes principally from CES that has liberated them, Szoka said, from relying on their members for financial support, like other trade groups. “Their interests sync up quite well with American consumers,” Szoka said. “They want a healthy, functional tech sector. That may explain why they are quicker to move. It's an opportunity to steer things in a good direction. ” Asked whether he still thinks Trump is unqualified to be President, Shapiro told BuzzFeed News “the American people have decided he's qualified. What I think doesn't matter. ”   "
74553,113457, How Snapchat Kept Fake News Out,Buzzfeed News,Nitasha Tiku,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161202095810/https://www.buzzfeed.com/nitashatiku/snapchat-fake-news
"," Facebook emerged during the US election as a central political and news source, but also a hub for hoaxes, propaganda, and outright fake news  —   an issue that brought wide criticism and concern from figures reportedly including Obama. But its leading US competitor, Snap (formerly Snapchat) has managed to sidestep the issue. Snap now boasts 150 million daily users, roughly 10 million more than more than Twitter. It's a growing source of breaking news for its users. When Trump purchased a national “Crooked Hillary”   during the presidential debates, it was viewed 80 million times, and yet the sometimes controversial social network doesn't come up in the rancorous debates over fake news. There are a handful of obvious reasons why Snapchat might be a less fertile ground for propaganda from Macedonian teens, hoax purveyors, or hyperpartisan websites masquerading as news.   content on Snapchat disappears after a short period of time. News is contained in a separate section, called Discover. Posts from the people you follow are displayed chronologically, not by popularity or personalized algorithm. On Snapchat, the name of the game is projecting authenticity, not racking up faves, and the rules of the game are enforced in the way the app is designed. Snapchat profiles do not display a follower count or even let users know how many followers they have. Plus, it's hard to go viral when you can't pass around a link to an individual's post. As Farhad Manjoo noted in the NY Times, “The diminution of personalization algorithms and virality also plays into how Snapchat treats news. ” The process publishers go through to get on Discover is as controlled as the rest of the app and involves a number of human gatekeepers along the way, a Snap representative told BuzzFeed News. Before they can post in Discover, news publishers have to be vetted as a potential partner, an agreement that comes with strict terms. Discover partners who publish daily on Snapchat in the US, France, and UK include recognizable names like CNN, MTV, Le Monde, Sky News, and Cosmopolitan. Jim VandeHei, the   of Politico, even created a presidential   Discover channel called We the People, in partnership with NowThisNews, but content, like today's offering, “Are you ready for texts from Trump?” seems more pop culture than partisan. (NowThisNews shares an investor with BuzzFeed. BuzzFeed is a Discover partner in both the US and UK BuzzFeed also ran NBC's Snapchat content during the summer Olympics.) Although publishers have editorial independence, there is collaboration between staffers who produce content for the app and Snapchat's Discover team, which gives guidance on formatting. Content can be optimized to do well on Facebook and Twitter by altering the headline or image, but on Snapchat, articles have to be reformatted to fit the app. Publishers can   to stories to their Discover content, but those links take you back to the app. These features were built around Snap's belief that users who share and consume content from friends provide the most potential for   growth, Rob Fishman,   of Niche, a company that connects brands with social media influencers, told BuzzFeed News. “Snapchat makes discovery of people who aren't in your phone book extremely difficult because they believe    sharing is stickier than a   influencer model,” said Fishman, whose company was acquired by Twitter in 2015. “They do see value in premium and traditional publishers, but they've created a   experience to capture that kind of content. ” “It's impossible for somebody to go rogue in Discover. ”  This is a huge difference from other social networks, where publishers and brands are “basically identical to individual users,” Fishman said. “It's impossible for somebody to go rogue in Discover because everything in there is seen and vetted by Snapchat. ” The same kind of propaganda that plagued Facebook could theoretically be disseminated within Snapchat in a couple of ways: through a Live Story (a mashup of photos and videos around a particular event like a concert or rally, curated by Snapchat) or a Story from individual accounts, which users can create by adding photos or videos of what they're doing throughout the day. In those cases, however, a combination of human editors, the visual medium, and   design also make it inhospitable to fake news. Individual Snapchat users can add text to an image or video, but space is limited. It's possible to imagine a scenario where an individual uses their Story like a talk radio, but that kind of content is hard to share and Snapchat doesn't promote individual accounts. “You literally don't know how many followers you have on Snapchat, so it's not designed for premium accounts to amass huge audiences. This is supposed to be million paper cuts, not a few heavy hitters,” said Fishman. For Live Stories, which show up in Discover, Snapchat relies on human journalists and editors, with relevant experience in verticals like music, entertainment, travel, or fashion, the company said. Last year, Snap hired Peter Hamby, one of CNN's best known political reporters, as its head of news. Live Stories created   are rigorously   a Snap representative told BuzzFeed. In the spring of 2015, Snap started covering politics along with other hard news. Live Stories in that category include coverage of US election coverage, historic flooding in South Carolina, the Brexit vote in the UK, and the Brazil impeachment vote. Hard news stories are produced  . Some Live Stories are comprised of photos and videos from Snapchat users, but again, the content is curated by Snapchat and goes through a human editor first. Apple News, the mobile app released last year that has 70 million active users and content from 4, 000 publications, is another potential platform for spreading fake news, which, like Snapchat, also relies on human touch points along the way. Apple News became a significant driver of traffic during the election cycle in particular. CNN has reported that Apple News sent 36. 5 million unique readers their way in September, and Bloomberg reported a 400% jump in visitors from Apple News in October. In fact, sources told BuzzFeed News that Apple News has had to deal with a pretty significant number of attempts to spread fake news and hate speech through the platform. However, the same   approach that keeps iTunes and the App Store running smoothly has worked in Apple News. For example, Apple News reviews publishers who join Apple News. Individuals can also share content on Apple News, but if their RSS feed departs from the usual fare, Apple can detect that. There's also a    function where users can flag fake news or hate speech within Apple News, and the company curates any content that gets featured, also like the App Store. Manjoo's recent profile of Snap in the Times emphasized that favoring human editors and eschewing virality represented a big departure from more established social networks. Fishman pointed out that those innovations are also carefully managed. “In my opinion Snapchat is both ambitiously experimental but also very tightly controlled,” Fishman said, pointing to the introduction of Stories and of Spectacles. “Both were dramatic and unprecedented offerings, but the way that they launched them was very carefully planned and executed. You can see that especially with Spectacles. There's a lot of buzz around it and there are only a few pairs. ”  "

"," More than 2, 300 scientists, including 22 Nobel winners, called on the incoming Trump administration and legislators to respect and include scientific evidence in policy decisions. The group, which includes Nobelist and former National Cancer Institute chief Harold Varmus and MIT Nobelist physicist Frank Wilczek, signed an open letter published Wednesday by the Union of Concerned Scientists, addressed to   Trump and the 115th Congress, that outlined a vision for research in the new administration. “People benefit when our nation's policies are informed by science unfettered by inappropriate political or corporate influence,” the authors wrote, and asked that scientists be allowed to work free of “political or   interference,” publish independently, and communicate their work to the public, to Congress, and to their colleagues. It came amid heightened concern from scientists about the incoming administration as Trump fills his cabinet. A recent survey by the Science Advisory Board found 72% of scientists believed the new administration would impact science negatively. Trump himself has tweeted that climate change was created “by and for the Chinese,” and advisers in the camp have said NASA must avoid “politicized science” and quit monitoring climate change. Myron Ebell, a vocal climate change skeptic, is leading the EPA transition team, and Rep. Tom Price, named this week to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, has called for cuts to research funding. Some observers questioned, however, whether the missive will carry any weight with Trump. “This is a great wish list,” Albert Teich, professor of science, technology, and international affairs at George Washington University, told BuzzFeed News. “And as long as we're dreaming, we'd like a pony and a   train for Christmas. ” Others see a thinly veiled warning to the incoming administration. “It seems to be a shot across the bow,” Mark Harkins, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, told BuzzFeed News, noting that the letter lacked token niceties like congratulations on the  's victory, or an explicit mention of intentions to collaborate. Instead, in stating that the group would “closely monitor” the administration's actions and “stand ready to hold accountable any who might seek to undermine it,” Harkins said he sees a signal that translates to, “We're putting you on notice that we're watching. ” “That's not a partner  —   that's not what your buddy does,” he said. “That's what your nemesis does. ” The letter also asks that legislators preserve “high standards of scientific integrity and independence independence in responding to current and emerging public health and environmental threats. ” Here Harkins, who worked as a staffer and legislative director for members of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, sees a reference to Rep. Lamar Smith's efforts this summer to subpoena emails of climate scientists at federal agencies in his role as the chair of the House Science Committee. Shawn Otto, author of the book War on Science, told BuzzFeed News he believes the letter is addressed as much to the public as to the incoming administration. He saw a “warning shot” that underscored the notion that “in America we do things based on evidence instead of the assertions of the powerful,” Otto wrote in an email to BuzzFeed News. Teich said the Union of Concerned Scientists laid out reasonable claims and requests  —   all of which he agrees with. His beef is that the “letter reads as if these were ordinary times, but they're not. ” So far Trump and his inner circle of advisers have “shown no apparent regard for   policymaking or for science,” Teich said, and he believes the letter is unlikely to change that: “It's spitting in the wind. ”  "

","After two weeks spent waffling on immigration, and making noises on the subject largely indistinguishable from those of Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, Trump has settled on a hawkish position  —   and a practical one. Trump's   antics aside, in his immigration speech in Phoenix, Ariz. on Wednesday he laid out a sensible, realistic path forward on genuine immigration reform. Trump's plan, even in its most primitive iterations, always has been based on the entirely commonsensical principle that America's immigration policy should serve American interests. Taking this as a starting point, Trump laid out a   policy that emphasizes securing the border, enforcing immigration laws, prioritizing the removal of criminal aliens, and creating the legal and economic disincentives necessary to reduce illegal immigration in the long term. Trump would add to this an expanded use of   which would help prevent employers from exploiting illegal labor and so make it more difficult for illegal immigrants to find work. “Turning off the jobs and benefits magnet,” to use Trump's words, would make the prospect of entering and residing in the country less enticing for foreigners. If immigration trends at the height of the Great Recession are any indication, a sizable number of illegal immigrants are likely to return home when jobs are not readily available. It's for this reason that the common refrain of either amnesty or mass deportations is a false choice. Much of our   population is here because the economic incentives outweigh the possible costs. Reversing that calculus would cause many to go home. But deportation is still a necessary tool. Trump has rightly determined to focus limited government resources on criminal aliens  —   illegal aliens residing in the country who have committed crimes. This superficially resembles the Obama administration's stated enforcement policy, but, of course, the administration has gutted interior enforcement, while Trump is promising to strengthen it dramatically. Trump's speech did not address what would be done with the sizable number of illegal immigrants who would inevitably remain in the country following the enactment of his enforcement policies. On the radio on Thursday morning, he said that the decision would come “once everything is stabilized,” but added: “I think you're going to see there's really quite a bit of softening. ” But enforcement policies of the sort outlined above would, in all likelihood, significantly reduce the   population residing in the country and make the question of what to do with the rest easier to address. Trump's rhetoric on immigration has frequently been reckless, and on occasion he has seemed to play to feelings of animosity. He would be well served to strike a soberer tone. But on the merits, Trump has put forward a responsible immigration agenda. "

","The one great service of Trump's extended peregrinations on immigration policy is to have demonstrated how, in the end, there's only one place to go. You can rail for a year about the squishy soft,   and stupid politicians who have opened our borders to the wretched refuse of Mexico. You can promise to round them up  —   the refuse, that is, not the politicians (they're next)  —   and deport them. And that may win you a plurality of Republican primary votes. And what happens to the noncriminal illegal immigrants? On that, Trump punted. Their “appropriate disposition” will be considered “in several years when we have . . . ended illegal immigration for good. ” Everyone knows what that means: One way or another, they will be allowed to stay. Trump's retreat points the way to the only serious solution: enforcement plus legalization. The required enforcement measures are well known  —   from a national   system that makes it just about impossible to work if you are here illegally, to intensified border patrol and   tracking. EDITORIAL: A Tough but Sensible Immigration Policy, The main objection is symbolic. Walls, we are told, denote prisons. But only if they are built to keep people in, not if they are for keeping outsiders out. City walls, going back to Jericho, are there for protection. Even    Europeans have conceded the point as one country after another  —   Hungary, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Austria, Greece, Spain, why even Norway  —   has started building border fences to stem the tide of Middle Eastern refugees. The other part of the immigration bargain is legalization. What do you do with the 11 million already here? In theory, you could do nothing. The problem ultimately solves itself as the generation of the desert  —   those who crossed the border originally  —   is eventually replaced by its   children who are automatically legal and landed. But formal legalization is a political necessity. It gets   from Democrats who for whatever reason  —     humanitarianism or   partisanship  —   have no interest in real border enforcement. Legalization is the quid pro quo. If they want to bring the immigrants “out of the shadows,” they must endorse serious enforcement. RELATED: Trump's Immigration Speech Made Good Sense Sound like Extremism, Such a grand bargain could and would command a vast national consensus. The American public will accept today's illegal immigrants if it is convinced that this will be the last such cohort. This was the premise of the 1986 Reagan amnesty. It legalized almost 3 million immigrants. Because it never enforced the border, however, three has become eleven. And that's why the Gang of Eight failed. They too got the sequencing wrong. The Left insisted on legalization first. The Gang's Republicans ultimately acquiesced because they figured, correctly, this was the best deal they could get in an era of Democratic control. The problem is that legalization is essentially irreversible and would have gone into effect on Day One. Enforcement was a mere promise. More Immigration Is Immigration to the U. S. an Entitlement? Memory Lane, with Billy J. On Migration, Europe Is Admitting the Truth to ItselfHence the emerging Republican consensus, now that Trump has abandoned mass deportation: a heavy and detailed concentration on enforcement, leaving the question of what happens to those already here either unspoken (Trump on Wednesday) or to be treated “case by case” (Trump last week). The Trump detour into  —   and retreat from  —   deportation has proved salutary. Even the blustering tough guy had to dismiss it with “we're not looking to hurt people. ” The ultimate national consensus, however, lies one step further down the road. Why leave legalization for some future discussion? Get it done. Once the river of illegal immigration has been demonstrably and securely reduced to a trickle, the country will readily exercise its natural magnanimity and legalize. So why not agree now? Say it and sign it. To get, you have to give. That's the art of the deal, is it not?,"
79792,120630,The Menace of Air Conditioning,National Review,Varad Mehta,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/439581/air-conditioning-ban-puritan-sumptuary-laws
","Something strange has happened to air conditioning of late. It has become one of America's chief sources of hot air. For the last decade, each summer as temperatures rise, so does a tempest of dismay at Americans' affection for artificially cooled air. The latest gust of disapproval was vented by the Washington Post's Karen Heller, the title of whose rambling, incoherent column against Willis Carrier's gift captured well the attitude of a small but vociferous cabal: “I don't need air conditioning, and neither do you. ” Heller offers various reasons for her dislike, some serious (lower electric bills) some not (it ruins film noir). None, however, is her real motivation. For underneath it all lurks a strong suspicion that air conditioning is somehow wrong, unnatural an affront to an order of things that does not exist but could and should  —   and would but for AC. Heller isn't explicit, but her meaning is clear enough: Without air conditioning, life would be better. There are two ways to get people to give up goods society doesn't want them to have: making them more expensive and banning them. The records of both can charitably be described as mixed. Nevertheless, the Left has been clear that it is open to both approaches to reduce the presence of these “bads. ” The Left does have historical precedent on its side. For most of history, luxury items were subject not only to moral and social but also legal sanction. For most. But not all, and there's the rub. For the Left's solution to the perceived ills of air conditioning etc. is to revive sumptuary laws  —   a solution that, to be viable, requires turning the consumption of luxury goods back into a social problem, something it hasn't been considered for 250 years. A History LessonThe moral stigma that once attached to the idea of luxury has been effaced from the West's cultural memory. (Look at some advertising if you don't believe me.) Yet until recently, most societies regulated the purchase of luxury goods. They did so via sumptuary laws, as laws restricting personal expenditure are known. Sumptuary laws don't outlaw the sale of certain goods rather, they outlaw their purchase by certain people. The goods that can't be purchased are “luxuries,” and the people who aren't allowed to buy them are the poor. Sumptuary laws, write the scholars Maxine Berg and Elizabeth Eger, “confine the consumption of specific commodities to the elites,” thus “enforc[ing] rigid status structures. ” Different societies defined luxury differently, but whatever it was, they all thought it was something the poor shouldn't have. Mandeville aimed to provoke, and he succeeded. His book became one of the most notorious of the century. Yet he also succeeded in provoking a revolution in the social standing of luxury, a success perhaps best exemplified by a people that experienced a different kind of revolution. In 1780, Samuel Adams hoped the USA would be a “Christian Sparta. ” Seven years later John Stevens Jr. writing as “Americanus,” would have none of it: “Away with this Spartan virtue and black broth we'll have none of them. ” The stigma against luxury went with them. Two centuries later our body politic remains immune to it. Every so often, however, someone is tempted to test its resistance in the hope that it has worn down. The lifestyle cops are the latest to try. They don't frame their case against air conditioning and the rest in terms of luxury they can't, thanks to Mandeville and his successors. Yet even if the word luxury were nowhere to be seen (in fact, it is not entirely absent) substantively they are identical. The present antagonism toward air conditioning, cars, meat, and having children is animated by assumptions similar to those that inspired the traditional hostility to luxury. What the historian Henry C. Clark says of “luxury” in the 18th century is no less true of air conditioning (etc.) today. Both presented ideal vehicles for “rethinking the boundaries between private morality, social obligation and public interest. ” Now as then, guardians stand ready to patrol those boundaries. Which is to say that once again the rich have arrogated to themselves the duty of telling the poor what they may and may not have. Some Like It HotKaren Heller's screed was but the latest entry in a genre that has become as much a summer staple as   movies  —   the cri de compresseur. From William Saletan's 2006 critique of “the deluded world of air conditioning” to Kate Murphy's 2015 lament of the “deep freeze” offices experience every summer, the genre shares a belief that air conditioning is wasteful, indulgent, misguided, and even immoral. In 2012, two participants in a NY Times forum prompted by a Times report that AC use was exploding in the Third World answered the question “Should   go global, or be rationed away?” in terms that could have been borrowed from an     tract. Stan Cox advocated limiting air conditioning (“a luxury we can't afford”) on the grounds that we must distinguish “between absolute necessities like food or water and manufactured necessities like a houseful of refrigerated air. And making such decisions could help us recover some of the resilience our own culture has lost in the age of  . ” Rajendra Shende, former head of the U. N.'s ozone program, said air conditioning, iPads, fatty foods, and cars are not “rights” but “are luxuries, and they often make us soft. ” Literally soft, perhaps, as some investigators have found a link between air conditioning and obesity. Luxury makes society soft. Air conditioning is a luxury. QED. Mandeville must have been spinning in his grave. Of all the contributions to the literature, perhaps none is more characteristic than Leon Neyfakh's 2013 portrait of the idyllic life Americans might enjoy if we “decided we could no longer afford our addiction” to AC. People would wake up earlier, take naps in the afternoon, and “ride bikes and scooters everywhere. ” “Porch culture,” with its “  card games and flowing iced tea,” would make a comeback. They'd even sleep on their porches, as they did in the good ol' days. Some of the accommodations that would be necessary to get by with less air conditioning (  attire at work) can be effected with little difficulty. But others are not as feasible. “We can also build houses to offer extra protection against the heat,” avers Neyfakh, “using principles ignored by most modern architects. ” That's fine for someone building a new house, but what about those who aren't? And where would residents of urban   find porches to sip iced tea and sleep at night on? (There is at least a modest tension between the Left's disdain for air conditioning and its valorization of cities, which are generally hotter than their environs.) Like many critics of AC, Neyfakh proceeds from the conviction that it deprives us of a better world. Without it, he concludes, “we might discover we've been missing out on a way of life that actually feels quite natural. ” Neyfakh exemplifies the attitude of those who, according to Daniel Engber, their most percipient critic, have “come to see the air conditioner as a   for everything that's wrong with the country and the world. ” “The case against cooling,” he wrote in 2012, “stands on a foundation of   ideas and intuitions” about global warming, health, “moral laxity, and some ambiguous notion of what it means to live in harmony with the natural world. And running through them all is the strange and puritanical politics of human comfort. ” Like most puritanism, this version too is hypocritical. Indoor heating is just as artificial as air conditioning and expends as many resources, but no one is clamoring for the abolition of central heating. This double standard infuriates Engber. Heating has made the transition from luxury to necessity. The comfort police, however, refuse entry to AC. Neyfakh concedes that in limited circumstances it is necessary, but like Heller he believes that for the most part we can get by without it. If that's so, it's not really necessary. What is not necessary is superfluous, and what is superfluous can be dispensed with. Except air conditioning is a necessity in the modern world. Many of our most crucial systems would not function without it, not least the servers that make the Internet possible. There is also the small matter that lack of air conditioning literally sickens and kills people: by the hundreds and the thousands. If something that prevents people from dying is a necessity, then   would seem to fit the bill. Europeans remain unconvinced. The argument is an even harder sell to those who scorn air conditioning as a symbol of American extravagance and decadence. Returning to the fray last year, Engber again castigated the selective outrage that condemns AC but excuses heating, calling it “provincialism in the guise of  . To inveigh against the air conditioner is to claim that someone else's discomfort isn't worth the same as yours. It pretends that feeling hot and feeling cold are in different moral categories. ” The principle that goods and consumers occupied different moral categories is what once justified sumptuary legislation. Engber's indignation against this “naked ideology and posture” is entirely appropriate. What irks him most is how facile the stance against AC is. It endures without any factual support for a simple reason: It has become a way for “cosmopolitans to claim their bona fides, and to place themselves in opposition to irresponsible, American excess. ” For all the hot air it generates, on the scale of social malfeasance, air conditioning remains a minor nuisance. When it comes to supposed excess, nothing provokes the consumption cops like Americans' diets. Here they are much more open about their desire to impose sumptuary laws (though never by that name) to curtail availability of two foods they want to see much less of on Americans' tables: meat and sugar. Share article on FacebookshareTweet  Let Them Drink WaterThe news that in 2015 U. S. meat consumption rose at the highest rate in four decades was greeted with   and consternation on the left. ThinkProgress grieved that “America Cannot Kick Its Meat Addiction. ” Vox, mouthpiece of   censoriousness, was more verbose but equally  : “Americans should eat less meat, but they're eating more and more. ” There may be good reasons to alter how we consume meat, such as health and animal welfare. Yet the hectoring tone of many   diatribes leads to the suspicion that the goal is not moderation but elimination. What else is one to conclude when they sport titles like “Meat is horrible” and have URLs that declare “meat is destroying the planet”? Since many progressives take it for granted that the production and consumption of meat is an environmental calamity, exiling meat from our kitchens seems the only certain cure for the maladies it causes. Sharply reducing meat intake would reduce one's carbon footprint in half by adopting veganism, according to Vox's Brad Plumer. The consequences of not doing so are proclaimed by the minatory title of a 2015 New Republic story by Rebecca Leber: “This Is What Your Hot Dog and Burger Are Doing to the Planet. ” They are, in so many words, killing it. Or, rather, you are. So stop being a planet murderer, Leber admonishes us, and eat a veggie burger instead. The   campaign savors of a moral panic. And where one finds a moral panic, efforts to impose behavioral modification, whether voluntary or otherwise, can't be far behind. Two English academics, Caroline Wood and Wayne Martindale, contend that citizens of wealthy countries must “reduce their meat consumption and embrace other sources of protein. ” As there are numerous alternative sources of protein (Wood and Martindale stump for pulses) meat cannot be considered a necessity. And what is not a necessity is a luxury. Wood and Martindale say so flatly: “Meat is a luxury item. ” (Perhaps surprisingly, Mandeville agreed. He thought meat was one luxury everyone should go without, as he believed killing another creature for food was immoral.) If you can't ban a luxury, you tax it. A few proposals to tax meat have been floated, but they have not gotten much traction in the USA. There is also doubt about their efficacy. Which is just as well, given concerns that vegan diets can be harmful to children. Meat won't be treated like tobacco anytime soon. Sugar, however, is already heading down that path, and the food police won't be satisfied until it experiences the same ostracism from polite society. Progressives, paternalists, and other assorted busybodies have been pushing for a “soda tax” on   beverages for years. As Nanny Bloomberg could tell you, except in Berkeley, all attempts to implement such a tax went down in flames. Until, that is, this past spring, when Philadelphia became the first major city to pass one. When it was still being debated, Philadelphia's proposed soda tax became an issue in the Democratic presidential race. While Clinton backed it, Bernie Sanders opposed it on what seemed to be impeccably progressive grounds. It was, he said, a “regressive grocery tax that would disproportionately affect   and   Americans. ” For once, the Vermont senator found himself to the right of a cleavage on the left, as many progressives believe such a tax affirms rather than violates progressive values. Writing in Mother Jones, Anna Lappé depicted soda taxes as an eminently progressive idea whose revenues can be used to fund an array of progressive initiatives. The funding for new and expanded programs more than justifies the tax, as does the goal of reducing sugar consumption. If it falls disproportionately on the poor, so what? “It's not like this tax is for something people have to buy,” sniffed Lappé. Whatever they're drinking in Berkeley, it's not soda. Progressives were euphoric at news of a study showing that Berkeley's tax apparently put a significant dent in soda consumption. The fact that none blanched at the likelihood that the results would “confirm that a soda tax will encourage   consumers to choose different beverages” shows that progressives are willing to tolerate taxes that hit the poor if they facilitate progressive goals. As one researcher told Vox, “the big picture is that, thus far, particularly among   populations, the   beverage taxes do work  —   they do reduce consumption of sugary beverages. ” The results of the Berkeley study were released only a few days after the news that Americans were eating more meat. If the Berkeley findings are replicated in Philadelphia, don't be surprised if progressives start pushing for a meat tax. Such a tax would impact the poor most. But we've just seen that progressives have little compunction about squeezing the poor's pocketbooks. Indeed, that seems to be the point. There's an old adage that holds that if you want less of something, tax it. Progressives want less meat and sugar in our diets, and they're willing to tax them out of it. The cost will always hit the poor first and most: The less they can afford, the less they'll buy. It's for their own good, after all. For not the first time, progressives have become evangels of temperance. No doubt they would scoff at the comparison. Not without reason: Abstemiousness and   are hardly virtues one associates with the Left. Yet   is what it preaches when it comes to meat and sugar. Taxing alcohol because demon rum encourages ungodliness and undermines the moral fabric of society is something no   progressive would now support. But taxing   drinks to strike a blow against “Big Soda” and its baleful effects on society's health is something no   progressive can now oppose. A constitutional amendment against Mountain Dew is not on the horizon if progressives get their way, it won't be necessary. Carless WhisperFor all their agitation about Americans' consumption habits, nothing wounds the pride of our   Catos like Americans' continued refusal to give up their cars. Earlier this year a   writer, Edward Humes, decried the “absurd primacy of the automobile in American life. ” Enumerating a litany of harms it purportedly causes, from wasting money and fuel to the havoc it yearly wreaks on life and limb, he pronounced that “in almost every way imaginable, the car, as it is deployed and used today, is insane. ” A reflexive recourse to cars may be legitimately questioned, but the continual befuddlement expressed at Americans' unyielding embrace of   transport often reeks of condescension. The hoi polloi simply refuse to heed their superiors' wisdom, a refusal often couched as ignorance and denial. Why do Americans keep driving? Because, for one thing, low gas taxes relieve them of the burden of bearing the true “social cost” of their cars. Eric Jaffe's sketch of a world in which gas prices are more representative of “the true cost of driving” bears a striking resemblance to Karen Heller and Leon Neyfakh's   utopia: Fewer loved ones killed in car crashes. Healthier pregnancies and babies. More time spent with family and friends. Better access to jobs, and perhaps as productivity increased, higher wages. More livable developments and, with them, slimmer waistlines. Cleaner and quieter air. The sorts of things we can't fit in our purses or wallets, but which cost us dearly just the same. Progressives have a name for this utopia: Europe. One common charge leveled at our infatuation with cars is that the Interstate highway system ruined America's cities. Curiously, though, just as “we're finally getting sick of cars ruining our cities,” many writers with urbanist inclinations have begun arguing that cars may well be their salvation. Hence the recent profusion of articles extolling the virtues of autonomous cars and their potential benefits for cities. In one scenario, “taxibots” will “transform cities in extraordinary ways” by allowing city planners to   urban infrastructure to be more adaptive to shifting needs.   cars could be great for cities, but only if the social and political will exists to transform how Americans use cars. That transformation, unsurprisingly, ends with Americans' giving up their own cars. In one version of this future, by 2030 all cars on the road are  . Eliminating private car ownership is a requirement for the “heaven” prophesied by urban futurists to be realized. In this “alternative universe” where traditional cars are retired, the space once devoted to roads could be reclaimed for “trees, bike lanes, sidewalks, play spaces, bike parking, café expansion, community gardens, or even swimming pools. ” Yes, we would have to surrender our cars (and our autonomy, as not only cars but trips themselves would have to be shared) but the price would be worth it. Progressives, it turns out, love cars  —   as long as no one is driving them. The problem with this vision is its very  . All these articles talk about how great driverless cars will be for cities, as though somehow people will stop living in Idaho, Wyoming, and Nebraska, or the rural parts of states along the   corridor. Most people, when they think of a city, imagine one like NY, all density and skyscrapers. But many of America's   large cities (such as Phoenix, Austin, and Charlotte) have a decidedly suburban character. This poses a potentially fatal challenge to the vision of an urban revolution propelled by the adoption of   vehicles, for it is possible that instead of dampening Americans' enthusiasm for sprawl, SDVs, thanks to the efficiencies they introduce, will accelerate it. As the Wall Street Journal's Christopher Mims put it: “It is a kind of wishful thinking, an act of technological determinism, to think that   cars will override Americans' longstanding preference for wide open spaces. ” That our glorious   future may not belong to cities but instead prolong progressives' suburban nightmare would be a delicious irony. Delicious like a Big Mac, Coke, and fries. (One imagines, should they become the norm, a new genre of dystopian thriller in which it is a crime to reprogram your   car to drive to a speakeasy McDonald's.) However autonomous vehicles play out, cars in one form or another would remain a necessity. But personal ownership could well become a luxury. And we know what happens to luxuries. Share article on FacebookshareTweet  Please Don't Think of the ChildrenThe “luxury good” that progressives, at least those of a more verdant hue, most want to see less of would at first glance seem to be the one most necessary for human survival: children. This makes a certain sense  —   every new human is a potential       suburbanite. You can never have too few of those. Most Americans, I think it safe to say, don't factor environmental considerations into the decision to have children, if they are aware of them at all. But for a few they are a major variable in the calculus. Hence the almost   agonizing about having kids that has of late become almost de rigueur in   precincts. According to a 2009 study, having a child increases one's carbon footprint more than can be offset by a lifetime of   measures. A 2015 Wired story was slightly less subtle: “The Biggest Threat to the Earth? We Have Too Many Kids. ” The story doesn't always match the headline, but this time it did. “The only way to save the world is to stop making more (and more, and more, and more) humans,” wrote Nick Stockton, its author. Agreeing with that sentiment, a handful of people have vowed publicly not to have children and thereby contribute to the “population problem. ” Erica Gies, an environmental writer, announced that “I'm not having kids because I can't in good conscience contribute to the rapid diminishment of our world. ” For one thing, “the habitat is not conducive to successfully raising human young. ” (Doubtless she'd have preferred the habitats of the Ice Age or Europe during the Black Death.) But she also touts her choice as proof of human superiority: “Part of human ingenuity, part of adaptation to a changing world, part of learning to do things better is to stop or greatly reduce breeding. ” Not having kids: It proves how great we are. No wonder environmentally conscious people who do have children experience anguish and something bordering cognitive dissonance. Gies's headline tells the real story: “Why I'm Not Having Kids  —   and You Shouldn't Either. ” You. Should. Not. That is a moral imperative, one very like Karen Heller's injunction against air conditioning. I don't need it, and what I don't need, you don't need. For Travis Rieder, a philosopher at Johns Hopkins, the only possible answer to the question “Should we be having kids in the age of climate change?” is a resounding no. (What the answer was to the question “Should we be having kids in the age of the atom bomb?” is left unstated.) Philosophers like paradoxes. Rieder, being no exception, proffers this one: “Maybe we should protect our kids by not having them. ” But how do you persuade people to save humanity by helping it cease to exist? You guessed it: a tax. Rieder would have wealthy nations impose a progressive childbirth tax that increases with each additional child a family has. If you want less of something, you tax it Rieder is adamant that he wants less humanity. It's the only way to forestall inevitable ecological calamity. To save the planet by letting mankind go extinct: Such is the reductio ad absurdum of the sumptuarian (to coin a term) outlook. Framed this way it sounds ridiculous, yet there is a certain cold logic to it. Without children, you wouldn't need airplanes to take them to Disney World, or cars to drive them to toy stores, or meat to feed them, or air conditioning to keep them cool. Reduce the one, reduce all the rest. No wonder the Left is so infatuated with cities these days. Yet our cities, increasingly   are less a promise than a warning of what happens when children are regarded as a luxury. A city with no children is a harbinger not of a better future but of none at all. Children are the ultimate luxury. In many ways, they are the costliest good someone can have. Any luxury good may be subject to sumptuary laws, yet to treat another human being this way, even on the pretext of a supposed duty to prevent environmental cataclysm, is to violate a principle that exists on an altogether more fundamental level of moral obligation: the principle that no human being shall be treated merely as a means to an end. Is the future itself a luxury? For the sumptuarians, especially those motivated by environmental concerns, the answer is almost assuredly yes. But Rieder (and those of like mind) would perhaps counter that it's not that we can no longer afford the future, but that the future can no longer afford us. Once more, luxury finds itself at the treacherous crossroads where private morality, social obligation, and public interest come together. Luxury for Me, but Not for TheeThroughout history, one generation's luxury has been the next generation's necessity. What is novel about the goods discussed in this essay is that in their case, some advocates hope to reverse the process and turn this generation's necessities into the next one's luxuries. (Nor are the more ambitious likely to rest content restricting only these.) Some find that a laudable goal. Personally, I can't help but think that a world without children and road trips would be a poorer world than the one it succeeded. Even today, few of humanity's greatest advances would meet Mandeville's definition. Are antibiotics a luxury? Humanity survived for eons without them. But who now would give them up because they are not strictly necessary? What about broadband Internet? The federal government certainly thinks it's a necessity, as it is subsidizing access for the poor, thus sparing them from suffering the same deprivation all mankind did until 20 years ago. Examples could be adduced indefinitely. By now it should be clear that there are no definitions of luxury or necessity that can definitively describe even a single commodity, for even a single commodity will meet both definitions depending on who is applying them. And who is most likely not to have air conditioning, or to bear the brunt of consumption taxes? The poor. If an affluent,   white woman telling someone he doesn't need air conditioning isn't white privilege, there's no such thing. We don't think of it that way, so thoroughly has the matter been scoured from the Western imagination, but what one scholar termed the “  of luxury” is a cornerstone of modernity. The demise of sumptuary laws and the prejudice against luxury was a great victory for human liberty. The resurrection of either would be profoundly, deplorably retrograde. The rich have complained about how the poor spend money for as long as there has been money. For most of history, this was an illiberal posture. Now it seems to be gaining currency on the left. Sumptuary laws are oppressive. They exist solely to reinforce social hierarchies that is, to keep the haves up and the   down. They were already reactionary in the 18th century. They would be even more so today.,"
79793,120631,Trump's Immigration Speech Made Good Sense Sound Like Extremism,National Review,David French,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/439610/donald-trump-immigration-speech-smart-message-bad-delivery-wrong-messenger
","Last night, Trump outlined the core of a sensible, responsible immigration policy . . . and then promptly obscured that policy in an avalanche of    rhetoric, inane flourishes, and extravagant promises. He threw raw steaks at an audience hungry for red meat, and in so doing squandered a chance to persuade. Let's break this down into the basics. At its core, Trump's   plan turns on a few simple and sound concepts: It is the responsibility of the American president to secure the liberty and prosperity of the American people for the sake of national security, economic stability, and cultural cohesion, a nation must be able to control its borders and regulate who enters the country and those who enter the country must be people who will contribute to the health and vitality of the national community. Moreover, when speaking of the wave of refugees streaming from jihadist conflict zones in the Middle East, Trump rightly attacked the misconception that the “humane” response is to open our borders to migrants despite knowing that our jihadist enemy is attempting to infiltrate their ranks. In the aftermath of the Gulf War, when Saddam Hussein seemed poised to slaughter the Kurds, the USA established functional safe zones that allowed our Kurdish allies to survive and even thrive in place. We can and should do the same for Middle Eastern refugees today. Unfortunately, Trump's immigration views, even if sensibly expressed, are outside the mainstream of American public opinion. That wasn't a problem in the Republican primary, where he appealed to a plurality that was apparently longing for a celebrity voice to confront the establishment on immigration (and virtually everything else). But it's a problem now. A big problem. (We can't just “supervise” the safe zones, we have to create them, and that means a greater,   more dangerous commitment in the Middle East. Who's the globalist now?) The man takes a sound idea  —   for example,   the Cold War practice of ensuring that immigrants don't “advocate or publish ‘the economic, international, and governmental doctrines'” of the precise ideology we're fighting  —   and turns it into an “ideological certification” that exactly no one (outside his circle of true believers) trusts him to create, much less to enforce fairly and legally. And he does it all with a tone that causes those who feel genuine and justifiable compassion for illegal immigrants peacefully working and raising families in this country to recoil at his obvious disdain. He does not communicate in the language of a leader making hard choices after balancing all the competing interests, but rather in the language of a man who's punishing people he doesn't like. There is a powerful and, yes, compassionate argument for an immigration policy that is built around border security and domestic law enforcement. A president's greatest priority is his citizens, and when there is powerful evidence that current immigration policy is harming the economic   and security of American families, there is an obligation to act. More Trump Trump's Morning Joe TweetsA Question Needing an AnswerIs Immigration to the U. S. an Entitlement? In politics, however, method and message tend to merge, so a terrible messenger often discredits an   message. On immigration, this is precisely what we see today. If present trends continue and Trump loses a winnable race in large part because he's engaged in behavior that he should know repels the majority of the electorate, then the practical result will be not just the dreadful immigration policies of Clinton but also grave damage to the conservative case for immigration policies that protect and maintain American liberty, security, and prosperity. That is, in fact, Trump's likely immigration legacy: Thanks to his own blunders and failings, he's blazing the trail for open borders, amnesty, and a path to citizenship. He built this movement, and he's the biggest reason it won't achieve its most cherished aims.,"

","In today's technically sophisticated and globally connected world, we assume life has been completely reinvented. In truth, it has not changed all that much. Facebook and Google may have recalibrated our lifestyles, but human nature, geography, and culture are nearly timeless. Even as ideologies and governments come and go, the same old, same old problems and challenges remain. Abroad, Israel was constantly fighting on the West Bank against Palestinian guerrilla groups and in the air over Syria. It is likely that in another 50 years the story will remain about the same. The Middle East in 1966 was going up in flames, just as it is today  —   and in many of the same places. The Syrian government was overthrown in a coup. The Saudis, Jordanians, and Egyptians were involved in a civil war in Yemen. The Egyptian government executed Islamists charged with planning a theocratic takeover. American relations with Russia were tense. Moscow clamped down on dissidents and opposed almost all U. S. initiatives abroad. The Castro government in Cuba was railing against the USA, outlawing free expression and alleging American interference in Cuba's affairs. The only difference from today was that Cuban dictator Fidel Castro then was a    firebrand, not a     . Nothing has much changed elsewhere in the world either. Just as Cyprus today remains a bone of contention between Turkey and Greece, 50 years ago Greeks and Turks were meeting to resolve tensions on the divided island. Ditto the ongoing dispute between India and Pakistan, whose leaders met frequently during 1966 following outright war in 1965. There were also the sorts of rifts within NATO that have become so familiar. Today, the U. S. worries that the alliance is unraveling due to bickering and the unwillingness of European countries to increase their defense budgets. Fifty years ago, the problem was France. In 1966, the French actually quit the alliance, which suddenly had to transfer its headquarters from Paris to Brussels, Belgium. Nor were things that different at home than they are today. Fifty years ago, Walt Disney died while working on an animated version of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book, whose remake this year was a summer hit. In 1966, a new   series, Star Trek, premiered on television. Yet another installment in the “Star Trek” movie series (Star Trek Beyond) just came out in July. For all our new computer and video technologies, millions of young Americans still watch The Jungle Book and Star Trek, not that much differently from the way their grandparents did a   ago. Pop hits today do not sound all that much different from those that swept America in 1966, performed by groups such as the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, and Jefferson Airplane. Even fashion tastes come full circle. A man at work in a coat and tie looked about the same then as now. In 1966, miniskirt hemlines hit the    —   similar to the retro miniskirts of 2016. We often worry that 2016 America has become a violent society, with unprecedented mass killings at schools and universities. But unfortunately, nothing much has changed here either. In July 1966, mass murderer Richard Speck was arrested for butchering eight student nurses in their dorm in Chicago. The next month, Charles Whitman climbed up into a tower at the University of Texas at Austin and fatally shot 14 innocents, wounding another 32 (after killing his mother and his wife). The USA has dealt with racial unrest this year from Dallas to Milwaukee, after rioting in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 and in Baltimore last year. The   Division Street Riots broke out in Chicago in 1966, and there was also rioting in Lansing, Michigan, that year following the Watts Riots of 1965. The protest group Black Lives Matter has sprung up to galvanize popular support against the perceived mistreatment of African Americans by police. In 1966, Bobby Seale and Huey Newton founded the Black Panther party in a similar context. America and the rest of the world have made enormous progress in technology, science, and social relations. But beneath the veneer of 2016, human nature remains the same, and life often operates on principles similar to those from a   ago  —   and even before that. We assume that life in 1900 was unrecognizable in comparison to the modern world of 1950. It was, or was not, in the same way that 1966 is both like and unlike 2016. That persistent continuity of the human experience is why studying history remains about the only way to understand who we were, are, and will be.,"

","A new Washington   poll, released on Tuesday, shows that Clinton's   era of good feelings lasted approximately three weeks. Despite months of relentless media coverage of Trump, his endless string of campaign calamities (including a weeklong spat with the family of a fallen American soldier) and the increasingly widespread view that Trump is a bigot  —   the worst thing you can be in American public life  —   the two candidates are about equally unpopular.

Because none of the sources of her unpopularity are going away. POLL: Should Clinton Be Impeached? That would be of her own making, of course. Voters' sense that Hillary is untrustworthy is not a fluke. It's the consequence of the years she has spent periphrasing and circumlocuting  —   and, yes, outright lying. That has only reinforced what was obvious to many from their first introduction to the Clintons in the early 1990s: She has always been determined to claw her way into the Oval Office, by sheer force of will.

The time is now to come up with a comprehensive, positive agenda that presents a coherent and compelling alternative to the failed liberal agenda that, in 2020, will have held the day for a dozen years. Paul Ryan and the House Republican conference have tried to do this with their “Better Way” agenda, which offers an expansive, detailed agenda for six major areas: the economy, tax reform, health care, poverty and upward mobility, national security, and the Constitution. It's this agenda, or something like it, that will be crucial if conservatives hope to seem more than a rump opposition. So will be a dedication to promoting this agenda beyond traditional Republican borders a positive agenda needs to be pitched in Baltimore and Milwaukee, not just Orange County. And, finally, there must be leaders who understand how that agenda reflects conservative principles, and can articulate both as necessary. This is a tall order, but hardly an impossible one, and if Trump loses handily, as seems more and more likely, it will be a   opportunity to reconstitute conservatism to address the needs of a larger and more diverse group of Americans. Four years of Clinton will be enormously painful for conservatives. But millions of   Americans are going to be pained by it, too, and looking for an alternative. When 2020 rolls around, conservatives should have one to offer.,"
79796,120634,Why Are We Giving Money to Iran?,National Review,Ted Cruz,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/439583/iranian-ransom-illegal-maybe
","Earlier this month, Senator Mike Lee (R. Utah) and I sent a letter to StateSecretary John Kerry, Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew, and Attorney General Loretta Lynch on the subject of the Obama administration's $400 million cash payment to the Islamic Republic of Iran, which occurred on January 16, 2016  —   the day the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action officially went into effect, and the day four Americans unjustly detained by the Iranian regime were finally released. As the State Department has now admitted, this money was “leverage”  —   in other words, a ransom  —   to secure the release of those four Americans from the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. It is appalling that this administration paid a ransom to Iran. Our hostages should have been released unconditionally as a sign of good faith before, not after, any negotiations over Iran's nuclear program. Agreeing to this ransom sets a terrible precedent that if the Iranian regime wants more American cash, all they have to do is scoop up more of our citizens  —   as the Iranians have already begun to do. But as irresponsible and dangerous as the ransom payment was, it is not the only problem. The American people also need to know whether the payment violated U. S. sanctions on Iran for its worldwide support of terrorism. These sanctions remain in effect despite the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which, the administration has assured us, deals only with Iran's nuclear program. The federal regulations that implement the   sanctions generally prohibit transferring money to Iran, even if the money is converted into foreign currencies and routed through other countries, as was the case here. A private citizen, in other words, could go to prison for what the administration did. The knowledge that a series of payments totaling $1. 31 billion followed the $400 million cash payment only raises more questions  —   suggesting, as it does, that the administration is differentiating between the $400 million, which is the amount the government of the Shah of Iran paid in the original arms deal, and the $1. 3 billion, which is the interest the Islamic Republic claims on that money and would have to come from American taxpayers. Did the administration wire $1. 31 billion from the Judgment Fund to Iran? If so, then why did the administration make the $400 million payment in cash? Why did it convert the cash to foreign currency? And why did it ship the cash in an unmarked cargo plane? If the payment was legal, presumably the administration would have just transferred the money. These extraordinary measures suggest they were simply trying to avoid detection. None of this adds up, and we need to know if the Obama administration was trying to cover up criminal conduct. While Congress should draw attention to the administration's    scheme, the bottom line must not only be whether the Obama administration paid a ransom (it did) but whether the various payments to Iran were legal in the first place. If the Obama administration continues to refuse to answer the questions that will let Congress get to the bottom of these highly unusual transactions, Congress will have no choice but to compel the answers it needs. The mullahs know how they received the money. So should the American people. The Senate Judiciary Committee should join the Foreign Relations Committee and Banking Committee in promptly investigating this disturbing episode. Americans deserve an explanation of why the Obama administration is using their money not to fight terrorism, but to fund it.,"

","Rachel Dolezal, the white lady who got busted pretending to be a black lady, has somehow managed to get herself invited to be a feature at a rally for natural black hair. The rally, called the “Naturally Isis   Economic Liberty March and Rally,” will take place in Dallas on Saturday. So, why the hell did she invite Rachel Dolezal to headline her rally? Is the best way to celebrate your “cultural identity” really to invite a woman whose claim to fame is stealing it? I mean, it's not even like Dolezal stopped at posting a picture of herself in a rasta cap on Instagram. No, she literally (not figuratively) stole a black identity  —   as in, pretending to be a black person, telling people she was a black person, and telling people that a particular black man was her father even though that black man was denying it  —   to launch her own academic and activist career. Well, according to The Daily Beast, Brantley invited Dolezal simply because she had seen pictures of some of Dolezal's   work on television (yes, Rachel Dolezal now works braiding hair) and actually didn't know anything about Dolezal's history when she invited her. “I couldn't believe it,” Brantley told The Daily Beast in a phone interview. “People threatened to boycott me. ” “They are calling me a sellout and saying that I am ‘Massa's girl' or some mess like that,” she continued. “I just stopped looking and blocked everybody. ” The craziest thing of all, however, is that Brantley  —   despite now knowing everything about Dolezal's past  —   said she is still going to feature Dolezal at her rally. Dolezal, by the way, told The Daily Beast that she just doesn't understand why there's all this hubbub about her appearance. “It's a justice issue and I've been a social justice activist for years,” she said. “It's really that simple. ” More Race   Percent of Black Boys in California Fail State Reading StandardsUnsayable Truths about a Failing High SchoolBlack and Muslim Women Are Invisible to the Feminist MovementNo, though. It's really not. Why? Because you're not just a “social justice activist,” you're a “social justice activist” who made your career as a “social justice activist” by pretending to be black. You were even, as The Daily Beast recalls, suspected of sending a package full of racial threats to your own mailbox at the NAACP  —   a mailbox to which only USPS workers (who have since been cleared) and you had the key. So, no, it's really not just “that simple. ” Your past as a fake black person really does complicate things when it comes to you being featured in a prominent position at a “natural” blackness event. Now, this kind of behavior from Dolezal isn't all that surprising. After all, we're talking about a lady who, when asked if she was black, responded with, “I don't understand the question. ” But what is surprising is that people are continuing to fall for her garbage  —   even after it's been proven that “garbage” is exactly what it is. I mean, how does she do it? Really, it's almost impressive. Or, it would be . . . if only it weren't so sick.,"

","The Brazilians may not know how to run an Olympics, but they are just aces at impeachments. Americans should take note. The entire Brazilian political class has been in bad odor of late, with a   corruption scandal at the   oil company reminding the world why sensible people do not think much of   enterprises,   or not. Brazil was riding high for about five minutes there while commodities prices were unusually strong, but President Rousseff's         agenda  —   which differs from the current     economic vision mainly in aggressiveness rather than substance  —   did what it usually does. Unemployment and inflation took off, and   spending increased radically, resulting in an unbalanced fiscal position that caused Brazil's government debt to be downgraded to   status. As with the food riots in Venezuela, the Left in Brazil and internationally has whispered darkly that this represents a “coup” against a populist progressive who angered the world's corporate bosses and   fundamentalists. “Corruption is just the pretext for a wealthy elite who failed to defeat Brazil's president at the ballot box,” the Guardian sniffed. The truth is that Brazilians are not eager to go back to being the country in the Western hemisphere that people cite to illustrate what India used to be like. RELATED: Dilma's Fall Is Brazil's Gain, Rousseff's corruption, at least that which has been persuasively documented, is pretty small stuff by Brazilian standards  —   indeed, by U. S. standards. It is “pedaladas fiscais,” what we might call “creative” public finance. Brazil has   but notionally independent banks and pension funds, whose coffers were raided through a series of loans to the Brazilian government in order to hide the fact that the government's finances were such a complete and total shambles that payments otherwise could not be made to popular programs such as cash handouts to the poor and housing assistance  —   the stuff that politicians such as Rousseff and her party use to buy loyalty. In the USA, that sort of thing is just standard operating procedure for the federal government when it comes to things like Social Security, and for local government when it comes to public employees' pensions: magical accounting. In Brazil, that's a crime. Good for Brazil. About $18 billion was misappropriated through the pedaladas fiasco, most of which was paid back. By way of comparison, the U. S. government made at least $72 billion in improper payments in 2008, mostly through the major entitlement programs. A 2014 audit found that a U. S.   program (!) failed to account for at least $619 billion in spending from 302 federal programs, and the data that the government put forward to a rightly skeptical public was, in the words of USA Today, “wildly inaccurate. ” We have seen the future. At least Brazil has some nice beaches. RELATED: Venezuela Reaches the End of the Road to Serfdom, Corruption leads to poverty. It leads to poverty in Brazil, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Philadelphia, in Los Angeles, in Upstate NY, and in the Rio Grande Valley. Capitalism  —   the awesome productive capacity of free people  —   can bear many burdens and defray many costs, but it can be perverted and misdirected, too. From the   enterprises in Brazil and Venezuela to the   fantasies of U. S. progressives, we see that the real threat to capitalism is not domination but seduction. Brazil seems to be hearing that gospel. We refuse to listen.   Share article on FacebookshareTweet In November, the people of the USA almost certainly are going to elect Hillary Rodham Clinton their next president. Like Dilma Rousseff in Brazil, she will be the first woman to hold the office. Like Dilma Rousseff, she is an     pol who is deeply and consistently corrupt, habitually dishonest, funny with money, and prompt to dismiss any and all efforts at holding her to some basic standard of decency and accountability as  —   remember the words, which could have been Rousseff's  —   “a vast   conspiracy. ” We had to impeach the president the last time we had the poor national judgment to send a member of this hilljack crime syndicate to the White House, and Mrs. Clinton already has been acting as a   crime wave when it comes to the laws that regulate how sensitive government information is handled and how official communications are archived for the purposes of accountability and oversight. Mrs. Clinton has argued that this all stems from her being too stupid to understand how to operate a mobile phone: “I used one device,” Mrs. Clinton lied. (She used many and has a talent for nesting lies within her lies.) “Maybe it was because I am not the most technically capable person and wanted to make it as easy as possible. ” Poor Huma Abedin doesn't have one person in her life who knows how to handle an iPhone. Mrs. Clinton's personal corruption is worrying, and it is almost certain that we will spend some   part of the coming Clinton administration unraveling her   lies about her dealings with everyone from pushy   to Hollywood moguls to Russian oligarchs. But what is truly more worrying is that we have for the past several decades been establishing a series of precedents that give American presidents and legislators the power to do legally that which would in most ordinary circumstances be a crime, or at least a dereliction of duty. It bears keeping in mind how quickly this sort of thing can escalate: In 2008, Senator Obama was bemoaning the PATRIOT Act, which allegedly empowered our spooks to sneak at peak at your library card by 2011, Obama was ordering the assassination of American citizens abroad. For years, Obama insisted that he did not have the power to unilaterally suspend enforcement of U. S. immigration law  —   “I am not a king,” he said. At some point in the following years, he apparently acquired a crown and did just that. More Brazil Dilma's Fall Is Brazil's GainThe Rio Olympics: Catch the Fever! Hope for Brazil as a President Is ImpeachedDoes anybody think that when (to take one likely example) unfunded   pension liabilities torpedo Democratic strongholds in Illinois and California, President Clinton will resist the urge to engage in a little pedaladas fiscais of her own? What do you imagine the conversation will be like in Washington the day before the first Social Security check bounces? Will Washington respond to a newfound commitment to probity and rectitude, or with shenanigans that would make a Third World potentate blush to contemplate? In impeaching Rouseff, the Brazilians have taken one small step toward building a better and more prosperous society, one with a truly accountable government. We should consider taking similar steps.,"
79799,120637,Why the 1996 Welfare Reform Benefited Poor Children,National Review,Scott Winship,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/439586/welfare-reform-child-poverty-1996-law-poor-children
","Twenty years ago last week, Congress passed legislation overhauling the nation's cash welfare system. In a new paper, “Poverty after Welfare Reform,” I attempt to discern how hardship has changed among children since August 22, 1996, when President Clinton signed into law the legislation that created the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program. The report argues that, contrary to the claims of an influential book by Kathryn Edin and Luke Shaefer, practically no children live in families getting by on $2 a day per person. It concludes that “deep child poverty”  —   living under half the official poverty line  —   is probably no higher than it was before welfare reform. The study argues that both $   and deep poverty are measured very badly, making it difficult to draw conclusions from them about hardship trends. In contrast, child poverty (deep or shallow) unambiguously fell after 1996 and is lower than ever before. The paper is descriptive by design. Rather than making the claim that welfare reform caused child poverty to fall, I simply argue that it did fall (or was more or less unchanged among the poorest of the poor). However, I do believe that welfare reform actually reduced child poverty. This case is poorly understood by the critics of reform, who tend to distort it in predictable ways. Here I want to begin to lay out why conservatives believe that welfare reform benefited poor children, by clarifying what we do and don't mean by that. In a second piece, I will get to the facts that have convinced me that welfare reform reduced poverty. Well, sure, if you set up the debate to be about whether welfare reform was the only factor behind declining poverty or suggest that its goal was to completely eliminate poverty, that's a debate you have a pretty good chance of winning. I'll gladly agree with Weissmann that “TANF may have had some positive effects on the headline poverty rate, but it didn't   work miracles. ” If you think your opponent is arguing for miracles, it is likely that you are misinterpreting their claims. Other critics of reform seem to believe that claiming that welfare reform was beneficial amounts to saying that it achieved the single largest reduction of child poverty possible. Now that would be some achievement  —   successfully enacting the one set of policy details (and getting the Department of Health and Human Services to implement the one set of rules and regulations) that minimized child poverty to the largest extent possible. That's a pretty high bar, though, isn't it? The real question of interest is not whether welfare reform was the only cause of declining child poverty, nor whether it was the best conceivable way to reduce child poverty. The important question is whether welfare reform reduced child poverty or not  —   are children better off today than they would be if we had not passed welfare reform? That is a difficult question to answer because none of us knows what the counterfactual would have been in the absence of reform. It would be silly for me to claim to have an airtight case. Nor does anyone who argues that welfare reform did more harm than good. But critics of reform should at least recognize the case as it actually exists rather than parrying an argument that no one is making. For example, Weissmann uses his critique as an opportunity to troll me by suggesting (falsely) that what I conclude is that   and Medicaid expansions prevented welfare reform's actual damage from being realized. That suggestion betrays a real lack of imagination about what would have happened absent welfare reform (in addition to misreading the evidence I present, but that's for the next essay). RELATED: Welfare Reform: Two Decades of Success, The old cash welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) was broadly unpopular because it violated   American values around reciprocity (expectations in return for help) and personal responsibility. Americans have historically been willing to help the poor, but only if they are willing to help themselves. AFDC discouraged work, marriage, savings, and independence. Any expansions to the safety net that occurred after 1996 took place in a context in which we had eliminated the old system in favor of one that was more consistent with widely shared values. To some extent, Americans (and legislators) became more generous after welfare reform because of welfare reform. Share article on FacebookshareTweet Under the old system, it is highly unlikely that Congress would have expanded the safety net as it did in response to the Great Recession, because most single mothers would have been able to rejoin the welfare rolls. Meanwhile, many fewer single mothers would have benefited from joining the workforce because under AFDC many would have remained on the rolls. (As I'll discuss in the next essay, rising employment was much more important for reducing poverty than Weissmann and other critics believe.) The technical way of stating this argument is that subsequent expansions of the safety net (like the increase in work among single mothers) were “endogenous”  —   we cannot assume they would have occurred absent welfare reform. It is also interesting to ask whether some other   policy would have reduced child poverty more than the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) did, regardless of whether or not that's what would have happened. But we don't know how any other   proposal would have affected child poverty. That some other theoretical plan might have done better is not a damaging criticism of PRWORA. RELATED: Ending Welfare as We Know It, Too many liberals are far too confident that the reforms they advocate would have been better than PRWORA and would be better than continuing current policy, because they tend to not seriously consider unintended consequences. Reforms that make receipt of welfare relatively more attractive will tend to draw more families onto the rolls and thereby run the risk of preventing them from benefiting from the advantages of employment. Or it will discourage planned and responsible childbearing by reducing its costs. Relatedly, many critics of reform are too dismissive of paternalistic   policy. “Don't people know what's best for themselves?” ask liberals and libertarians who assume that if work pays, people will naturally work. There is much to be said for this view, undoubtedly, but even if most people know what's best for them most of the time, some do not at least some of the time. Furthermore, policy shouldn't necessarily strive to give people what they think is best for themselves in a world where wants are potentially unlimited and someone else is paying. Some people value leisure more than work at the margin, and in that case we have to ask whether working taxpayers are obliged to support the leisure of those who could work but do what's best for themselves by not working. The same may be said of people whose childbearing decisions are what's best for them none of us is entitled to do what's best for ourselves and expect others to bear the costs. These particular ways of evaluating the success of welfare reforms are, in a sense, moral rather than economic. But conservatives hold these normative views, in part, out of the belief that work and responsible childbearing may benefit children economically even if they do not make parents happier in the short run. For that matter, they may make society better off economically in the long run by promoting economic growth. In the end, the conservative resistance to weakening the tough provisions in the 1996 law stems from the belief that  —   regardless of whether there might have been a better way  —   welfare reform improved the lives of the poor when compared with the old system. We get very nervous about departing from a model that a lot of evidence suggests was better than the status quo. Of what does that evidence consist? I'll get to that in my next piece.,"
79800,120638,"Embryo Ethics, 15 Years Later — Pro-Lifers Owe a Debt of Gratitude to George W. Bush",National Review,Brendan Foht,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/439597/embryo-stem-cell-research-ethics-george-w-bush-prolife
","Fifteen years ago last month, President George W. Bush announced his policy on federal funding for    research, a policy that would shape the political conflict between the   movement and the scientific community for the rest of his administration. (For an overview of the debates that ensued, interested readers will enjoy this comprehensive report issued in 2012 by the Witherspoon Council on Ethics and the Integrity of Science.) Bush's plan for   research was an elegant compromise  —   he would permit the federal government to fund research on   lines (that is, cultures of embryonic stem cells that can be grown indefinitely and shipped to researchers around the world) that had already been derived from human embryos (21 lines in total) but he would not fund research on new   lines. This policy would allow the government to support the burgeoning field of   research without creating an incentive for scientists to destroy human embryos. An appropriations rider known as the   amendment has prohibited the federal government from funding research in which human embryos are created or destroyed, so government cannot fund the creation of embryonic stem cells, though research using those stem cells has been considered acceptable. Despite the overturning of Bush's policy, he has been vindicated to some extent by developments in   research. In 2006, a promising alternative to embryonic stem cells (  induced pluripotent stem cells, which are derived from adult skin cells and do not require the destruction of embryos) was developed, in part owing to vigorous support from the Bush administration. RELATED: Embryonic Stem Cell Hype  —   Was Hype, However, while the future is not as bleak as it might have been, the underlying moral problems raised by research on human embryonic stem cells remain unresolved. Although human cloning, for instance, became less vigorously pursued after the discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells in 2006, American scientists in 2013 created embryonic stem cells by destroying human embryos for the first time their feat was replicated by other American scientists in 2014. Cloning to create stem cells (which is to say, creating cloned human embryos for the express purpose of destroying them) remains legal in much of the USA and, in California and NY, is even supported by   agencies. Share article on FacebookshareTweet Most of the   controversy in the first decade of this century concerned the source of stem cells, but advances in   research now mean that troubling uses of stem cells, regardless of whether they are derived from embryos or not, are now being proposed by scientists. Adding human stem cells to animal embryos to generate chimeras (lab animals that contain human cells, tissues, and organs) is an emerging area of research that the National Institutes of Health is now considering supporting. Scientists are also working on ways to manufacture human sex cells (sperm and egg cells) from stem cells, which could dramatically transform the nature of human reproduction. There are likewise a number of areas of embryo research that will continue to result in the destruction of large numbers of human embryos. Though there is little data available on the kinds of embryo research being conducted in the USA, in the United Kingdom only about one in four   research projects involve the creation of stem cells. Recent developments in   technology may soon allow doctors to modify human embryos to prevent genetic disease. This raises the   specter of “designer babies,” though in fact, for the foreseeable future, the genetic modification of human embryos is likely to be confined to research  —   meaning that scientists will genetically modify human embryos, but to prevent the birth of any “designer babies” they will scrupulously destroy any of the human embryos they experiment on. Perhaps more important than any form of embryo research, however, are the practices of the in vitro fertilization industry itself. Most   research uses embryos that are “left over” from IVF clinics. IVF doctors will create many more embryos than they transfer to the woman's uterus, freezing the rest for future attempts. If a pregnancy is established before all the embryos are transferred, the parents are faced with the decision of what to do with the remaining embryos. Some are donated to other couples trying to have a child, some are donated to researchers, many are discarded, and others are simply kept frozen as parents struggle with the decision. The availability of these frozen human beings is what makes most embryo research possible. (More rarely, scientists create embryos expressly for research, as they do when they attempt to create cloned human embryos.) Though the   debate was often posed as a conflict between the demands of science and the demands of ethics, scientists could argue that they were only asking to be held to the same ethical standards as are IVF doctors, who regularly kill human embryos with little justification. Dealing with the underlying moral problems raised by   research means reforming the way IVF is practiced  —   reducing the number of excess embryos that are created so that thousands of human embryos will not be left in freezers to be either discarded or experimented on by scientists. Such reforms will not be easy, but it is a political project that deserves more attention from the   community. Though there are still many ways in which the treatment of the unborn in the USA can be improved, we can at least be thankful that, because of wise decisions like Bush's   policy, the situation of the unborn is not deteriorating as quickly as it might otherwise have."

","Brazil started a new chapter of its history this Wednesday, as the Senate voted to permanently remove socialist president Dilma Rousseff from office. And the Left lost more than that: It also no longer controls the narrative.   of the 81 senators supported the removal of Dilma, who had been suspended in May. Vice President Michel Temer, a centrist who succeeded to the presidency upon Rousseff's suspension, will stay in office until January 2019. The result surprised no one, since Dilma's approval rate had fallen below double digits in the last months. Were they right, it would have been the slowest and most peaceful coup ever. Not one shot was fired. There are no political prisoners. Dilma and her lawyers spent dozens of hours in Congress making the case for her absolution. She is still living in the presidential palace, and can stay there for 30 more days if she wants. The Supreme Court, in which 8 of the 11 judges were appointed by Dilma's Workers' Party, saw no reason to stop the proceedings. In fact, following the Brazilian constitution, the final phase of the trial in the Senate was presided over by the president of the Supreme Court, who was appointed by Dilma's mentor and predecessor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. RELATED: Brazil Has Had Enough, The coup narrative, echoed by part of the Left in Europe and America (the list includes Bernie Sanders) is not new. What is new is that this kind of discourse, embodied by Dilma and her image as an old   guerrilla who fought the dictatorship in the 1970s to bring “democracy” to Brazil, doesn't work anymore. Dilma's impeachment is not a story of political persecution. The fragmented Brazilian Congress started the impeachment trial reluctantly, only after public demonstrations repeatedly brought millions of people into the streets. In São Paulo alone, 1. 4 million people protested for Dilma's removal on March 13. The whole impeachment trial took nine months and passed through one vote on the floor of the House and three votes on the floor of the Senate. In all of them, the required   majority was surpassed. So benevolent (and corporatist) were the senators that, right after removing Dilma Rousseff from office, they even found a way to soften the punishment and allow her to be eligible to hold public office again. Despite its periods of instability, Brazil's political history has a long tradition of accommodation, with both good and bad consequences. On the one hand, it has resulted in a high level of tolerance for corruption and inefficiency. On the other, it has avoided the bloodbaths and civil wars that affected many of its neighbors. Even in the 21 years of the military dictatorship, for example, the regime killed 424 people, including armed guerrillas in combat. In comparison, Chile's dictatorship executed 40, 000 people in 17 years. Argentina's left 30, 000 dead in eight years. Both countries have only a fraction of Brazil's huge population. The fact that Brazilians aren't inclined to sudden ruptures also means several corrupt politicians will take part in the new administration. What changes, then, with the impeachment? Many things. First, the “classic” corrupt politician who cares only about his Swiss bank account is still less harmful than the one that uses dirty money to subvert public institutions, as the Workers' Party tried to do. Second, the socialist agenda that attacked economic freedom and pushed for abortion on demand and radical LGBT policies will be stopped, at least for a while. President Temer is not a conservative, but he and his party are way closer to commonsense ideas than Dilma and her allies. More Brazil Brazil Has Had EnoughThe Rio Olympics: Catch the Fever! Hope for Brazil as a President Is ImpeachedThird, the international consequences are not to be ignored.  Although the Workers' Party has been painted by the international media as a moderate force in South America, the truth is that it used the presidency to offer political and economic support to authoritarian regimes such as those in Venezuela and Cuba. Three years ago, for example, the U. N. found out that a harbor built in Cuba with Brazilian money was used to smuggle weapons to North Korea. Brazil still has a myriad of problems to solve. But the Brazilian people should celebrate the first, huge step in the right direction.  —   Gabriel de Arruda Castro is a Brazilian journalist. "

","One particularly tough and indigestible nugget of   stupidity afflicting the guts of conservatism is the idea that there is some sort of fundamental difference between bribing a business with tax cuts and bribing it with a wheelbarrow full of cash. The   bailout of Carrier's operations in Indiana provides an illustrative case. This is an example of banality hardening into orthodoxy, the worst habit of the   mind. It started with a good point. Once upon a time, U. S.   tax rates were very high: 91 percent in the Eisenhower years, though hardly anybody paid that rate. Democrats such as John Kennedy and Republicans such as Ronald Reagan believed that these rates were far too high. Both Kennedy and Reagan made what we might broadly call “Laffer curve” arguments for tax cuts, though Reagan's actual budget proposals were not quite as sunny as Arthur Laffer tends to be on the question of the real budgetary effects of   reductions. Milton Friedman took a more   view with his advice that if tax cuts produce revenue growth, then you haven't cut them enough. Part of the Republican response to this was based on Lafferism, and generally on a very naïve version of Lafferism: “You can't call that notional $1 billion tax cut a $1 billion expenditure, because the tax cut will produce growth effects that add to tax revenue. ” That is true as far as it goes  —   which is generally not as far as Republicans take it. There are commonly observed growth effects from cuts in tax rates, but they generally amount to something like 20 percent of the revenue “lost” under the   model. Sometimes they have been more than that. But the   belief that growth effects frequently amount to more than 100 percent of forgone revenue  —   that tax cuts “pay for themselves” or pay for themselves and then some  —   is not sustained by the evidence, and certainly not from the evidence of modern, advanced economies with tax rates that already are relatively low both by world standards and by historical standards. But whatever the growth effects are, that's a question of whether our model for estimating the budgetary costs of   reductions is any good  it is not  —   as our   economists insist  —   a question of whether those costs actually are costs. If a $1 trillion tax cut turns out to lower revenue by only $800 billion instead of the full trillion, that is still, as a   matter, indistinguishable from spending $800 billion. This is of particular interest to a government that is carrying a very large debt load. The math doesn't care whether your deficit comes from the revenue side of the ledger or the expenditure side. Debt is debt. But in the matter of   or   tax benefits of the sort extended to Carrier in Indiana, they do not have a leg to stand on. These are   corporate welfare, ethically and fiscally indistinguishable from shipping containers full of $100 bills. Those who take the opposite view work very hard to make a case that there is some kind of important ethical distinction between giving somebody something and declining to take something away from them. But relieving someone of an ordinary expense incurred in the normal course of affairs  —   as opposed to changing general tax law  —   is a gift. This is true both as a matter of law and of our ordinary experience. If I am, for example, a car dealer trying to win influence with a politician, and I sell him a new car at $50, 000 under the price that I charge other customers, then I have paid him a $50, 000 bribe. People go to jail for that. You'll recall that part of the Obama —  Tony Rezko scandal was the accusation that Rezko had arranged for the promising young politician to buy a house at $300, 000 under its asking price. Rezko didn't give Obama $300, 000 in this scenario  —   he just saw to it that Obama didn't have to spend that $300, 000. That is why bribery laws generally specify “any pecuniary benefit” rather than a duffel bag full of cash. For Carrier's accountant, any pecuniary benefit will do. So far as the bottom line is concerned, a $7 million tax credit is the same as a $7 million check or $7 million in Apple stock or $7 million in gold. It's all +$7 million on the line where you want it. The ethical question is more complicated than the   let on, too. Our government runs deficits, which means that a federal tax credit of $1 million given to Smith is $1 million in taxes that eventually will have to be paid  —   by Jones, and Wilson, and Humperdink  —   with interest. Carrier is a division of United Technologies (the Otis elevator and Pratt  Whitney engines people) which is first and foremost a government contractor, a firm that derives at least a quarter of its revenue from government contracts, and 10 percent of it from Pentagon contracts alone. It is a company that has competitors  —   competitors who employ Americans and pay taxes, just as Carrier does. These firms and their employees are put at an economic disadvantage by the subsidies paid to Carrier thanks to Trump and Pence. That means that some of these companies probably will be less profitable, and that they will not hire people they otherwise would have hired. But you'll see no Trump press conference celebrating that. This is a case of Frédéric Bastiat's problem of the seen vs. the unseen. The benefits are easy to see, all those sympathetic workers in Indiana. The costs are born by sympathetic workers, too, around the country, and by their families and by their neighbors. But those are widely dispersed, so they are harder to see and do not hit with the same dramatic impact. But the math is the math is the math. Trump and Pence are trying to sell you a free lunch, the same way the Keynesians and their magical spending multiplier do when they promise that government stimulus programs (Trump is pushing one of those, too) will somehow magically pay for themselves. There is no magical revenue fairy. And, as a budgetary matter, targeted tax benefits are identical to spending, both for the government and for the beneficiary. This is not a question of ethics but a question of accounting. Somebody always has to pay the bill, eventually. It probably won't be the   on the radio telling you that we can make money by giving it away, so long as we give it away to the right sort of people: Solyndra bad, Carrier good. Conservatives have a hard enough time of it as it is without inflicting needless stupidity on themselves.  —   Kevin D. Williamson is the roving correspondent for National Review. "

","The Left is not going to learn any lessons from 2016, apparently. Democrats in the House just crushed an upstart challenge to Nancy Pelosi's   leadership, rejecting Tim Ryan, a    congressman who represents a swath of   Ohio from Youngstown to Akron and   the Congressional Manufacturing Caucus, for the    San Francisco congresswoman who has presided over the largest House losses in modern memory, and who famously said that the House had to pass the Affordable Care Act “so you can find out what is in it. ” As for leadership outside the halls of Congress, the favorite to head the Democratic National Committee has been Keith Ellison, a Muslim congressman from Minnesota who has extensive ties to the Nation of Islam and the Muslim Brotherhood, and who has compared the September 11 attacks to the burning of the Reichstag. And, of course, the “leaders of tomorrow” populating the nation's dormitories have been engaged in a public display of mass neurosis. Students at St. John's University in Queens, N. Y. claimed that a “ ” flag in a campus window constituted “harassment,” while several student groups at George Washington University in Washington, D. C. declared that employing police on campus was an “act of violence” because the Fraternal Order of Police had endorsed Trump. RELATED: Dems Have a Pelosi Problem, Obviously, the Left's diagnoses of the ascendancy of Trump are not wholly wrong. Among a small fringe, Trump's was an explicitly racialist appeal. Likewise, “fake news” was a real problem, from “rigged election” conspiracy theories on Infowars to the Drudge Report's multiple stories about Bill Clinton's “son,” Danny Williams, a story that Drudge itself debunked years ago. But 60 million people are not “white nationalists,” or dupes, or whatever else. They are, on the whole,   Americans whose priorities simply differ from those of Slate writers. The Left has failed to understand the extent to which its intolerant, often coercive, approach to issues that permit   disagreement has turned off voters who might otherwise be sympathetic to their general program  —   and radicalized further those who aren't. The   chairman of Mahoning County, Ohio, recently told the Washington Post, “People in the heartland thought the Democrats cared more about where someone else went to the restroom than whether they had a   job”  —   and that's because it did. The Left has been relentless in giving to every partisan dispute the moral urgency of warfare. It's the Left that turned Supreme Court nominations into nasty affairs. It's the Left that   America's   industry on a   vote. It's the Left that scrapped the filibuster. It's the Left that forced nuns to purchase contraception. If the Right was willing to countenance a great deal of heterodoxy in 2016, it's in part because they perceive a Left that has become unconscionably radical. That is not to say the Right does not have serious problems of its own creation. Trump's success would not have been possible without a real, and alarming, moral and intellectual vacuity. Opportunism in   media trades on the emotivism of   listeners eager to have their worst fears about the country confirmed, and ideological zealotry has made the necessary task of compromise more difficult. RELATED: Learning from Nancy Pelosi, But radicalism breeds radicalism, and the Left, in the aftermath of a massive defeat, should recognize that. A Left that ensconces itself in a sanctimonious refusal to consider the world from the perspectives of its detractors is a Left destined to become more politically impotent and nastier. That may work to Republicans'   gain. But a nastier Left means a nastier Right. America needs a sane Left. At its best, the Left balances   excesses. Where the Right elevates the individual, the Left attends to the good of collectives. Where the Right values social solidarity, the Left values difference. The Right emphasizes the best parts of our common traditions the Left is sensitive to how those traditions have left certain people vulnerable, marginalized, or disenfranchised. More P. C. Culture   Histrionics on the LeftFinding the Roots of Violent Campus ProtestsWhy the Liberal Elite Will Never Check Its PrivilegeThis is worthy work. But it can't be imposed, and shouldn't be. A Left that can temper its sense of apocalypse by recognizing the legitimate moral prerogatives of its political opponents would aim to persuade rather than coerce  —   but, for that reason, would be able to expand its coalition and be better able to find common ground with the Right. A sense of common cause would be vastly preferable to our current moment of extreme polarization and defensiveness. But it requires a bit of humility. The Left, not its myriad scapegoats, is most responsible for its failures this year. A Left that can acknowledge that, and respond accordingly, will lead to a less radical Right, and a healthier politics overall.,"

","It's time for an open and frank national conversation about bear propaganda. Having grown up in NY City, I had not been made aware of the problem until fairly late in life. This was remedied by my lovely wife, who grew up in Fairbanks, Alaska, where bears are not an abstraction. In policy terms, I was an idealist and she was a realist. I was once watching a   commercial with my daughter in which a   woman was fulfilling the dreams that only MasterCard or Visa can make reality. She sat on a bus snapping pictures of some glorious polar bear that came right up to her window. At that moment, the mother of my child walked into the living room with a look on her face like she'd caught me watching Apocalypse Now with a   . “Bear propaganda!” she shouted. “It wants to eat her face. ” And even though my daughter and I tend to make fun of Mommy's obsession, over the years I've become convinced. The culture is shot through with bear propaganda.   runs elegant Christmastime cartoons of   families celebrating the season. Never mind that polar bears don't live in intact nuclear families. The males are cads who spend a few days with the single white females before scampering off to spend the rest of their lives as deadbeat dads. Also, if the supply of adorable (yet tasty!) seals runs low, the males have been known to eat bear cubs. They also eat other things when the opportunity arises. Which is what prompted this column in the first place. Last month, a video of a polar bear palling around with a dog went viral, appearing on numerous news shows and eliciting a chorus of “awws” from audiences and anchors alike. But experts in   behavior recognized that the bear was checking it out the way an experienced shopper squeezes a cantaloupe. Indeed, the bear was baited to come check out the dog so that a Canadian businessman could provide better   for tourists. “To me, it's like it's trying to see if the food's ready or not,” Tom Smith, a wildlife biologist, laughingly told the Washington Post. “It's not surprising that it would try to explore this dog . . . but I guarantee if you left that bear there long enough, it would say, ‘I wonder what this dog tastes like? '” Well here's the good news: The bear didn't eat the dog. The bad news: It (or another bear) ate a different dog. Why? Because that's the kind of thing polar bears do. But you wouldn't know that from popular culture. Every couple of months, a new   animated film comes out  —   Finding Dory, The Secret Life of Pets, etc.  —   in which animals have human personalities. Many animal lovers think it's harmless and entertaining  —   and in one sense they're right. I like a lot of those movies. But it's a remarkable thing if you take a step back and think about it. Many of these movies treat humans as the enemy  —   cruel, careless despoilers of the environment  —   while at the same time telling us that the highest compliment we can pay to animals is to assume they're just like us. These movies tell us virtually nothing about animals but a great deal about ourselves. Warthogs don't sing No Worries, and sharks have never joined a support group that says, “Fish are friends, not food. ” By all means put down the crystal and swim with your   dolphin friends. But bear in mind, male dolphins are rapists. And should you get a chance to steal a hug from a polar bear or grizzly, don't be surprised when it eats your face.,"
80805,121880,The Great and Misunderstood Challenges of Adoption,National Review,David French,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/442712/adoption-perilous-challenging-and-vital
","This Thanksgiving, a baby girl was left at a firehouse in Wantagh, N. Y. She was a mere four pounds, two ounces, and was immediately nicknamed “Baby Girl Hope. ” It's not every day that a young mom leaves her child at a firehouse  —   especially not on Thanksgiving  —   so the media covered the story, and within days more than 500 people had stepped forward, offering to adopt or care for Hope. I had several thoughts at the same time: On the other hand, the story is also heartbreaking, because we live in a world where a young mother felt the need to abandon her child to be raised by strangers. It's encouraging that she chose to give her child another home rather than pay a doctor to kill it in her own womb, but the sheer number of people who stepped forward eager to love this child demonstrates another sad reality: There are far more couples who are eager to adopt than there are children available. Our nation aborts hundreds of thousands of kids who could live in loving homes. I tweeted this sentiment, and immediately the snarky responses rolled in. A contributor to Vice and The Atlantic tweeted back, “Tell that to all the unadopted kids in our foster homes. ” Another person quickly chimed in, “Exactly. Because those kids are not as sexy as an infant wrapped in blankets. ” Another tweeted, “But don't you see? Only certain children are wanted. Some are not. ” Adoption is hard. There is no easy path, whatever those who sit in judgment of adoptive families might think. As my pastor says, every single adoption begins with brokenness. Every single one. In the best case, a mother voluntarily gives away her own child, which is   even when done for the purest of reasons. Other adoptions arise from far worse tragedies, including death and vicious abuse. An “available” foster child is only available because of a series of dreadful events. The older the child, the more often the scars from those events are deep and profound. It takes an extraordinary person to not just love a wounded child (that's the easy part) but to know how to parent a kid who's endured deep, deep trauma. Not every adoptive family is up to the task. RELATED: The Priority of Adoption, For that matter, not every adoptive family gets to find out if it's up to the task. If you want to adopt a baby in the USA, you should be aware that until parental rights are terminated, a young mother has the right to change her mind and retrieve her child. She should have this right, but words can't express the anguish felt by adoptive families when it is exercised. I can't imagine holding my kids as babies, believing and hoping I could raise them, only to have them taken away. That men and women are willing to risk this horrific loss speaks to their deep desire to adopt. The process of adopting through foster care has its own perils. There are parents who are raising foster children with the goal of adopting, yet they can't be certain the child they're raising and loving will be their child until that final, irrevocable termination of parental rights. I've heard unbelievable stories of kids' being taken from loving foster homes, exposed once again to terrifying abuse, and then given back to their foster parents even more traumatized than they were before. Adopting internationally, as my family did, frequently means placing yourself at the mercy of court systems that can act arbitrarily and capriciously, breaking your heart. Adopted children who come from deep poverty and malnutrition often have lasting developmental delays, and the sadly common practice of abandoning handicapped children means that international adoptive families often immediately have to seek significant medical care for their kids. And if you're lucky enough to survive all of these pitfalls, you'll still be forced to contend with those who either ignorantly or maliciously attack you for your choice. Adopt a baby and you're accused of ignoring older children. Adopt a child of the same race and you're accused of racism. Adopt a child of a different race and you're also accused of racism, or, alternatively, “virtue signaling. ” More Family Resisting the Divorce MomentumA Father's Day RemembranceHonor Thy FatherYet in spite of all this  —   the potential heartbreak, the   financial commitment, the   battle against the handicaps, developmental delays, and trauma that afflict so many abandoned children, and the judgment of others  —   adoptive families continue to line up and press onward. Why? Because adoption is wonderful. I'll never forget our adopted daughter's first night in our house. We were   after an   trip from Ethiopia and could barely stay awake, but when we laid her down in her new toddler bed, we couldn't take our eyes off her. We'd brought two biological kids home from the hospital and gazed in wonder at them in their cribs. Now we did the same for our newest daughter. We felt that same astonishing love. That's why you adopt, and that's one more reason why abortion is so horrible. Our nation is killing those who would be loved. No amount of sneering can change that indescribably sad fact.,"
80806,121881,Why Our Allies Love James Mattis and Our Adversaries Fear Him,National Review,Tom Rogan,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/442723/james-mattis-perfect-secretary-defense
","“I don't have worry and stress. I cause worry and stress. ” —   James Mattis, speaking at the Aspen Institute, July 20, 2013, Jim Mattis is comfortable with hard missions. His service record proves it. He fought honorably in the First Gulf War and Afghanistan, led the First Marine Division during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and held multiple command positions in Iraq after the invasion. Later, he served as a senior NATO commander, and as commanding officer of U. S. Central Command (CENTCOM). Along the way, he earned a reputation for aggressive operations and cultural sensitivity. U. S. enemies fear Mattis for his strategic brilliance. Reveling in introspection, Mattis recognizes the geographic, social, and psychological nature of the battlefield. A 2014 U. S. Command and General Staff College paper by Major Michael Valenti gives a good example. Valenti recounts how Mattis mitigated problems with supply lines and terrain before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He “studied National Geographic magazines to gain an appreciation for what would happen if the area between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers flooded as it did in 1955. ” He “mandated that every major and above in the division read Russell Braddon's The Siege,” which tells the story of the British Expeditionary Force's time in   during World War I, because it was”one of the few books written about fighting in Iraq. '” So Mattis is at once a scholar and a warrior. But he is equally respected for his calculated aggression. After four U. S. contractors were killed in Fallujah in March 2004, the Bush administration ordered the Marines to take the city. Skeptical that a   assault was necessary, the Marines nonetheless followed orders. But once near victory, they were forced to pull out when public pressure grew in Europe and Iraq. This required a second, bloody retaking of Fallujah in November. Mattis however, was unperturbed. In meetings and on the battlefield, he spoke the language of the Anbari tribes, and he delivered annihilation upon   in Iraq. Key American adversaries  —   China, Russia, and Iran  —   are well aware of this record and what it says about Mattis. It must be stressing them out. Iran has particular reason for concern. Commanding CENTCOM, Mattis pushed for tough realism in constraining the Islamic Republic's revolutionary expansionism. He recognizes that Iran's leaders are rational actors, but he also knows that their revolutionary impulses must be checked. For this, he earned the ire of Obama, who was so intent on kowtowing to the Iranian regime. But now he is set to take over the Pentagon, and Khamenei and the   have much to fear. First, Mattis is likely to push Trump to focus on fixing the Iran nuclear deal. This will likely entail reducing Iranian cheating on inspections protocols and Iranian   research. If Trump and Mattis work with U. S. allies (notably the French) who are concerned about Obama's failure to enforce the deal, Iran could face rougher waters next year. Mattis has suggested blockading the country if the regime tries to play hard ball. It's a good idea. Second, a Mattis Pentagon will likely take tougher action against Iranian aggression in the Middle East. As I've noted, Obama has largely ignored Iranian malevolence in states such as Lebanon and Iraq. That needs to be remedied, and quickly. Third, Mattis will deter Iranian terrorism against America. That imperative is real. In 2011, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards  —   as Mattis himself explains  —   tried to murder the   ambassador to the USA. The plan involved blowing up a Washington D. C. restaurant and everyone in it. Fourth, Mattis's realism will be useful in helping the U. S. to confront Sunni extremism more effectively. As I've explained before, thanks to his supplication to Iran, Obama has alienated America's   allies. Mattis, who is adored by the   monarchies for his honest courage, offers the Trump administration a chance to renew those bonds. That means new potential for a   crackdown on Sunni fundraising for groups such as ISIS and  . It also means we might see more special forces on the ground in Iraq and Syria. Of course, America faces challenges outside of the Middle East, too. Having totally discredited Obama in Syria, Vladimir Putin is now strategizing to manipulate Trump. Mattis will make Putin's task much more difficult. As a former NATO commander and keen student of history, he is well aware of Putin's ploys. And, as respected by Trump as he is, he has a unique opportunity to persuade the   to wake up to reality: Russia aims to toy  —   rather than cooperate  —   with America. Given Putin's aggression and the wave of political turmoil hitting Europe, Mattis's appointment will spark sighs of relief in London and other NATO capitals. Trump's erratic rhetoric on NATO has made our European allies fearful of what might come next. Mattis's appointment is a sign that the   status quo will hold. More Defense Mattis Steps UpThe Marines Can Treat Women Honorably Without Putting Them in the InfantryOn This Memorial Day, We Are Unmaking AmericaAnd finally, there's China. Dominating the Pacific region under its new hegemony and sucking U. S. allies under its orbit, China is threatening global trade, freedom, and security. But if challenged, the Chinese will back off. Why? Because the U. S. military and its allies are more powerful than China. Mattis has the proven credibility to use that power, keeping the Chinese in check. When he says something he means it. I hoped Trump would pick Mattis as his national security advisor, but this is an even happier outcome: He can do infinitely more good atop the Pentagon. Who knows? American red lines might even make a comeback.  —   Tom Rogan writes for NRO and Opportunity Lives.

","If one is to believe the more excitable oracles of cable television and the blogosphere, Trump's selection of retired generals for high offices foretells a wholesale militarization of American society and government. Soon, the country will look like Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, with American elementary schools teaching infantry tactics and U. S. generals plotting invasions of weaker countries.   opponents of appointing retired officers warn that the government will rely excessively on the military to solve problems, internationally and perhaps also domestically. Before applying for residency in Canada or Norway, Americans should examine the historical context of these prophesies. The historical record indicates, first of all, that opposition to former military leaders serving in government is most often applied selectively, based on one's opinions of the president or  . When Obama appointed General James Jones his   adviser in 2009, only three years after Jones had retired, one heard little handwringing over “militarization” of the government. The prevailing view was that Obama was wise to add someone with military experience to his team. In an era when identity politics has proliferated in the upper strata of American society, we should not be surprised to hear pundits and politicians presuming to know the intentions of others from their prior affiliations. The purveyors of identity politics are as mistaken in this case as in others. Retired generals are no more prisoner to their profession than are retired professors or retired lawyers. A wise military officer once warned against linking ability or character to the uniform that someone wears. Although military organizations work hard to cultivate good leaders, being a sailor or soldier, airman or Marine, Navy SEAL or Green Beret does not ensure that someone is a good leader. An officer's ability to lead is primarily a function of personal attributes  —   such as commitment, judgment, vision, and integrity  —   and the key ones are the same in the military as in the civilian world. The incoming administration is well advised to select top officials primarily on the basis of personal attributes, not prior occupation or other identity category. When Obama attempted to use the surgical strikes of drones and   forces as a panacea for terrorism, the aforementioned generals  —   including the world's two foremost practitioners of surgical counterterrorism, McChrystal and Flynn  —   objected that the strategy would fail. And they were right. Obama's misguided counterterrorism strategy is the principal reason why he is bequeathing disastrous messes in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Libya, and Pakistan. The soothsayers who forewarn of militarized doom also fail to consider the history of the USA prior to the 21st century. Twelve U. S. presidents were retired generals, starting with George Washington, who had been out of the military for less than six years when he became the nation's first   . None sought to create paramilitary youth organizations, or to wage a new war each spring. In the current case, we are not even talking about the president, but his senior subordinates, and only through a complete disregard of human nature can one argue that Donald J. Trump will let his subordinates run the show. Much of the fretting about “militarization” stems from a misreading of the nation's one major experiment in military governance, Reconstruction. After the Civil War, U. S. military forces governed the former states of the Confederacy, where they remained until their removal by the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. Many Americans believe that the act reflected disillusionment with military governance. Actually, unlike the civil governments of the Reconstruction era, the U. S. military had not governed poorly it was withdrawn because its presence ensured enforcement of a racial equality that was anathema to white southerners. When the U. S. military left the South, segregation followed. Racial equality would not return until 1957, when Dwight Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne Division to deal with an Arkansas state government that had disobeyed the U. S. Supreme Court. The segregationist state government yielded, and the 101st Airborne went back to worrying about foreign enemies, which it has done ever since, aside from contending with the occasional riot. History suggests that the only “risk” posed by the involvement of the military in domestic affairs is that it will be employed to enforce civil rights or restore public order. More Military Qaddafi's ‘good' son, c. Trump and His GeneralsThe Meaning of Memorial DayHigh representation of former U. S. military officers in the Trump administration will have salutary effects after eight years during which the president gave the military short shrift. Obama imposed a disproportionate share of federal budget cuts on the military and made military decisions based on what was good for his personal approval ratings or his reelection prospects rather than for the country. He overruled military objections to his   initiatives and consistently ignored strategic advice from senior military leaders. Several top generals were forced into retirement for disagreeing with Obama's policies or his   views of the nation's enemies. The presence of retired generals will help prevent further such wrongdoings and enable the administration to undo the damage that can still be undone.,"
80808,121883,General Mattis Is a Great Man — and a Good One,National Review,Jeremy Carl,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/442673/james-mattis-trump-secretary-defense
","Trump has made a number of promising picks for his cabinet, but surely none better than his selection of my Hoover Institution colleague General James Mattis as secretary of defense. His record shows clearly that he's a great man  —   the loyalty he inspires and the way he treats others shows, even more important, that he's a good one. I'll let others more expert in military matters chime in about the specifics of his strategies and tactics, but, while there are certainly many others who know him far better than I, there are some things I can say about General Mattis as a person, having worked down the hall from him the past three years. And, indeed, the loyalty that General Mattis commanded from his Marines was legendary. This continued at Hoover, where he was universally admired and respected by the scholars and staff. He'll need that loyalty and goodwill in the Defense Department as he attempts to manage one of America's largest and most intricate bureaucracies with its competing fiefdoms and interests groups. Contrary to his gruff,   reputation, exemplified by his famous “Mattisisms,” the Jim Mattis I saw was always courtly and deferential, never making a show either of his enormous professional accomplishments for which leaders so eagerly sought him out  —   or his enormous learning, particularly in military history, as shown by his personal library of more than 6, 000 books. For all of General Mattis's     reputation, he is clearly a deep strategic thinker who understands the value of seeing the present through the lens of the past. (For a great example of General Mattis as an intellectual, check out this example of him discussing the importance of reading for the officers under his command.) Catching myself, I would think: “Who the hell are you to be lecturing to General Mattis about anything?” But of course he would never tell me that himself, even if he thought so. He was only interested in what he could learn from a colleague, and he was always interested in talking to those with knowledge outside of his areas of specialty. In fact, General Mattis was often so modest and   that it was hard to square his formidable “mad dog” reputation with the almost relaxed personality that he projected. But in those same fellows' lounge discussions, he would sometimes take the lead, and to listen to General Mattis talk about military strategy, history, and doctrine was to take a master class in the art of war. This week at Hoover, it has been impossible to miss various unfamiliar personnel going in and out of General Mattis's office. Throughout that time he seemed casual and relaxed, as if it was just another day at work. If you've made a career out of decisions involving the lives and deaths of thousands of U. S. Marines under your command, a presidential nomination, even for one of the most senior roles in government, just isn't a cause of significant stress. I spoke briefly with General Mattis earlier this week, and rather than seeming preoccupied with his own situation, he asked about “that big, beautiful family of yours. ” (I had brought my wife and five young children to Hoover's annual birthday celebration for the Marine Corps, which General Mattis had attended as one of the guests of honor.

After speaking with General Mattis, my older boys, ages ten and eight, were ready to sign up as Marine recruits.)   When I waved away his kind remarks about my family this week, he stopped me short and said with seriousness, “Those kids are the people we are fighting for. ” Washington, D. C. has a way of distracting people from doing the things they should be doing with worries about petty bureaucratic infighting, who is rising and who is falling in power, and what's in the daily newspaper. General Mattis, in remembering the family of a junior colleague at a time in which an ordinary man would have understandably been thinking only about “me, me, me” showed, as he has shown throughout his career, that he is not an ordinary man. And as secretary of defense, General Mattis will indeed be fighting for my kids, and millions of others like them. I'm confident that even in times of stress, he won't forget it. In an era of picayune distractions, of Twitter feeds and talking heads, General Mattis will always stay focused on the mission.,"
80809,121885,Congress Issues Criminal Referral for Planned Parenthood in Texas,National Review,Alexandra DeSanctis,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/442721/planned-parenthood-investigation-congress-issues-criminal-referral
","About a year and a half ago, a series of horrifying undercover videos emerged online, depicting workers at Planned Parenthood clinics casually discussing the transfer and sale of the body parts of unborn children. Few people seemed to pay attention to the issue after the initial shock of the videos wore off, but one group of U. S. congressmen  —   the House Select Panel on Infant Lives  —   is still uncovering evidence, confirming the truth of what was shown in the videos: Planned Parenthood was indeed involved in this illegal activity. The latest news on their investigation came on Thursday, when Utah congresswoman Mia Love announced on the House floor a list of eight criminal referrals  —   recommendations that local law enforcement further investigate the groups in question. Among the referrals was one made to the Texas attorney general's office regarding Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, after the panel discovered evidence indicating that the group sold body parts of aborted babies to the University of Texas, an activity that is illegal under both Texas and federal law. The investigation is ongoing, and more referrals are expected as the committee continues its work. In fact, the panel released an interim report in mid July on its findings, detailing the methods used by Planned Parenthood and several TPOs to profit from the distribution of fetal tissue. The evidence included the fact that at least one TPO explicitly advertised itself to Planned Parenthood as “financially profitable” and “a financial benefit to your clinic. ” The investigation also yielded evidence that these groups violated additional federal laws in the course of this trafficking, including some meant to protect vulnerable women from exploitation. The criminal referrals Love listed yesterday were made over the course of the past year to state or local authorities in the jurisdictions where the suspected violations occurred, and provided evidence to local officials so that they could determine how best to proceed. In most cases so far, the referrals have resulted in ongoing   investigations into the organizations in question. In one case, Orange County has filed a lawsuit against two   companies that allegedly sold the fetal tissue of aborted babies. (These companies had a close affiliation with Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties, from which they received the tissue in question.) Democrats and   activists will likely continue to cast this investigation as “ ” and “politically motivated,” but with each subsequent announcement from the select panel, the pile of evidence against Planned Parenthood and its affiliated biotech firms becomes that much more difficult to refute.,"
80810,121886,Would Another Republican Have Defeated Clinton?,National Review,Michael Barone,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/442651/how-trump-won-democrats-created-midwestern-opening-white-voters
","Would any Republican besides Trump have beaten Clinton and been elected the 45th president? It's an interesting question, not susceptible to a definitive answer but with consequences for politics going forward. Last fall, I shared the widespread view that Clinton was the only Democrat who could lose to Trump and Trump was the only Republican who could lose to Clinton. Given the fact that elections are a   game because one candidate must win, this view was more an expression of distaste rather than a prophecy. This seemed to make sense then. Trump had much higher negatives, especially among white college graduates, who had voted   percent for Mitt Romney in 2012. Without similar support, how could he hope to win? We have an answer to that question now. Springtime polls seemed to assume the electorate would look much like the one in 2012. The signs that Trump would run much better than Romney among    whites weren't very clear, particularly when his controversial comments caused his overall numbers to sag. Those outstate areas trended the same way as Iowa, none of whose 99 counties is in a metro area with a   people, and whose six electoral votes went for Obama and for Trump. There, polls showed Trump opening up a significant lead over Clinton in  . In Iowa and the outstates, Trump won percentages higher than George W. Bush did in 2004, while Clinton ran far behind Obama's 2012 showing  —   12 points behind in outstate Ohio, 11 points behind in Iowa and outstate Michigan, 9 points behind in outstate Wisconsin and 8 points behind in outstate Pennsylvania. These are all places with many    whites and few blacks, Hispanics, and Asians. Trump's stands on trade and immigration  —   distinctly different from those of other Republicans  —   were surely partly responsible for his outstate margins, and it seems unlikely another Republican nominee could have matched them. Two other factors were in play, factors that led to sharp Democratic gains in these same areas in the 1970s. One was honesty. The outstate Midwest recoiled against Richard Nixon's Republicans in the Watergate years, and this year, these voters had a similar reaction to Clinton's   lawbreaking and lies. That helped Trump, though it probably would have helped any other Republican nominee. The other factor was dovishness. The Upper Midwest has long been the most isolationist part of the country. In the 1970s, voters there reacted against Republicans' support of the Vietnam War. This year, they seem to have moved toward Trump, who opposed military interventions supported by other Republicans. It seems unlikely another Republican nominee could have duplicated this appeal. So I find myself leaning reluctantly toward the conclusion that no other Republican could have won, at least the way Trump did. Yes, others would have run better with white college graduates, whom Trump carried by only a   percent margin, and would have run much better among groups with high levels of social connectedness, such as Mormons in Utah and   in metro Grand Rapids, Michigan. But Trump saw, or stumbled into taking advantage of, an opening spotted by only a few political analysts  —   blogger Steve Sailer way back in 2001, RealClearPolitics' Sean Trende in a 2013 article series and FiveThirtyEight's Harry Enten in analyzing Republican Joni Ernst's big Senate win in Iowa in 2014. I made similar observations but didn't nail it the way they did. That opening was the fact that Democrats were taking for granted their    support from    outstate voters in their determination to build a new, “ascendant” majority of blacks, Hispanics, single women, and Millennials. They figured that outstate Obama voters were locked into the Democratic party and didn't need any special attention. Turns out they weren't and they did. So the familiar partisan lines of the past 20 years have been redrawn, and now we have a more downscale Republican party and a Democratic party confined to its coastal and campus cocoons. We'll see how that works out.,"

","As the media continue their ideologically driven campaign against   Trump (thinly disguised as journalism) a target of choice has been the men and women selected for Cabinet posts. Among these is Senator Jeff Sessions, Trump's choice for attorney general. Attacks against Sessions hinge on   conversations that may have included racist terms (which may or may not have been said in jest). I have known and worked with Senator Sessions for more than 15 years and know firsthand that his leadership, his compassion, and his actions to uplift “the least among us” far outweigh the weak allegations brought against him. Flowers lived in Lowndes County, the site of 43 miles of the   1965   march from Selma to Montgomery. For the past 50 years, purported spokespersons of the black community have conducted annual parades along the route to commemorate the march. But it seemed that they never looked left or right to witness the poverty that surrounded them. They certainly made no effort to alleviate it. In addition to the crisis of waste disposal, there were no public recreation facilities for youth and no public libraries, and the county's schools were heated by   coal furnaces and lacked wiring sufficient to support computers and Internet access. With virtually no manufacturing and economic development in the area, employment opportunities were dismal. Yet, at the end of each annual parade, the leaders typically returned to their speaking engagements and comfortable offices, putting thoughts of Lowndes County aside until the following year. Many of them would be among the cohort to rail against Senator Sessions's recent nomination for AG. Yet, where they did nothing, Sessions was the one who took action to marshal support to revitalize the desolate community. Senator Sessions intervened to move forward congressional appropriations from the EPA to provide funds for the installment of septic tanks. He joined with CNE to meet with Household International (HSBC) which elicited   support from consultants who worked to tackle the immediate problem of waste management and launch a   initiative to promote economic development, provide   training, and create housing opportunities. In 2004, Senator Sessions hosted a meeting on Capitol Hill that brought 100 corporate and policy representatives to learn about the Alabama Rural Initiative (ARI) in which Catherine Flowers was involved. As a result of that meeting, Microsoft Corporation donated more than $65, 000 worth of software to equip computer centers for the   residents of Lowndes County. Representatives from the U. S. Department of Labor who attended the event encouraged the ARI to apply for a planning grant for a Career Development Workforce Center. The grant was received in 2005, and a comprehensive plan was developed to bring together workforce preparation, adult remedial education, and   initiatives in Lowndes County to provide a road out of poverty for its residents. Senator Sessions's support for Lowndes County also includes efforts to preserve its historical legacy. When he received a letter from an angry constituent demanding that Alabama's Interpretive Center along the   March trail be closed down and charging that it was “an orgy temple of hate,” Sessions toured the Center's exhibits with Flowers and declared that “everyone should know this history. ” He was instrumental in transferring the authority for the Interpretive Center from the State of Alabama to the National Park Service, where it will be preserved in perpetuity. Catherine Flowers recently sent me a powerful testimony to Senator Sessions. “I have been seeing all the press on Senator Sessions and I do not recognize the person they are describing,” she wrote. “From my vantage point, I do not know who he may have been at one time, but I have known him to be a friend to the people of Lowndes County. ” Those who would oppose the appointment of Senator Sessions as attorney general would do well to consider the words of Obama in his eulogy for Senator Robert Byrd, a former member of and recruiter for the Ku Klux Klan: “We know there are things he said and things he did that he came to regret. . . . As I reflect on the full sweep of his years, it seems to me that his life bent towards justice. Like the Constitution he tucked in his pocket, like our nation itself, Robert Byrd possessed that quintessential American quality, and that is a capacity to change, a capacity to learn, a capacity to listen, a capacity to be made more perfect. ”  —   Robert L. Woodson Sr. is the founder and president of the Woodson Center (formerly the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise). "
80812,121888,Rob Portman's Crusade against Opioid Addiction,National Review,Alexandra DeSanctis,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/442688/opioid-addiction-crisis-rob-portman-legislative-crusade
","Nearly 30, 000 Americans died of opioid overdoses in 2014, deaths caused by overuse of either licit prescription painkillers or illicit heroin. Addiction to these drugs has skyrocketed over the past decade and a half, to the point where about 120 Americans die of such overdoses each day. In light of these frightening numbers, opioid abuse is finally beginning to receive   attention. And thanks in part to the efforts of one U. S. senator, Congress has for the first time begun to implement a comprehensive strategy attacking the problem. Senator Rob Portman has been waging a crusade against drug addiction for the better part of the past two decades. This summer, at Portman's urging, Congress passed the historic Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) and Obama signed it into law. Now Portman is offering similar support for the 21st Century Cures Act, a bipartisan bill that will, among other things, dedicate $1 billion in state block grants over the next two years for the prevention and treatment of opioid addiction. “It's a poison coming into our communities and affecting everything,” Portman tells National Review. “And unfortunately, it's getting worse not better. ” In 1996, Portman founded and chaired PreventionFIRST! an   coalition that develops comprehensive solutions to youth substance abuse. In recent years, though, he has honed in specifically on opioid abuse, which presents a unique challenge: Nearly every one of the hundreds of recovering opioid addicts he has encountered has said that shaking the grip of opioids was more difficult than shaking other addictions. RELATED: How   Abuse Unleashed a Heroin Epidemic, “The story is not as   as some people like to think,” says Sally Satel, an addiction psychiatrist and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. “It is true that the   of opioids to patients with pain has definitely been a large part of the increase in painkiller abuse. That's because it gets more opioids in circulation, and from there they can be stolen and sold by people who are addicts. When pain patients abuse medications prescribed to them, they are typically individuals with a previous or concurrent problem with drug or alcohol abuse, or depression and other psychiatric conditions. ” Portman is hopeful that the resources and programs outlined in CARA will help to alleviate the growing epidemic in Ohio and across the country. The bill funds   methods for recovery and prevention, decreasing the potential for ineffective government spending. In addition, some   can apply directly to the government for funding, which enables them to deploy solutions targeted to the needs of individual communities. The Cures Act would build on the $181 million a year outlined in CARA, awarding block grants to states, based on demonstrated need, from a pot of $500 million for each of the next two years. Portman suggests that Ohio might be eligible for somewhere between $20 and $40 million in the upcoming year, given the drastic nature of its opioid problem. RELATED: America's Heroin Crisis Was Birthed by the Law of Unintended Consequences, Jessica Nickel, president of the Addiction Policy Forum, believes that both CARA and the Cures Act represent a tremendous step forward, because they offer unique resources and follow a   model for treatment and prevention. “CARA for the first time is a comprehensive response to addiction,” Nickel says. Despite his advocacy for federal funding to combat addiction, Portman believes that communities must take primary responsibility for addressing the crisis. “I don't think Washington is going to solve the problem,” he says, “but it has a role to play in helping communities be able to deal with it. ” There is still a long way to go. For one thing, when federal and state governments began to implement aggressive measures against   abuse in 2010,   deaths began to rise steadily. (Heroin is often easier to obtain and cheaper than painkiller prescriptions.) For another, much opioid abuse comes not from individuals overusing their prescribed drugs but from patients who sell some or all of their medication to other addicts. Portman believes that a combination of   treatment and effective law enforcement will be most successful. He emphasizes that addiction is a disease requiring treatment, rather than simply the result of bad decisions or moral failings, and that getting people to accept as much will reduce the stigma surrounding addicts, leading more of them to feel comfortable seeking treatment. In his own experience with recovering opioid addicts and their caregivers, Portman has seen that   programs such as   arrangements tend to have the best results. “These types of programs are much more successful at helping people turn their lives around and lead a productive life,” he says. Such an approach also helps to reduce the number of individuals who relapse on release in some regions,   officials report rescuing the same individuals from drug overdose multiples times over the course of just a few months. More Drugs A Space Needle, Spaciness, Needles . . . The U. S. Needs to Act in VenezuelaThe Opioid Crisis Should Kill the Call to Legalize Hard DrugsPortman believes that strengthening the ability of the   system to handle   offenses with sensitivity, rather than tossing offenders directly into jail, is just as important as emphasizing   treatment. Incarcerated addicts will often undergo painful withdrawal symptoms if they are successfully prevented from continuing to take illegal drugs in jail, emerging with the same drug dependency they faced when they arrived. Portman believes that drug courts, which incentivize recovery by mandating detoxification programs that address offenders' addictions, are a better solution. Such courts tend to have higher success rates because they closely monitor offenders and threaten incarceration as a penalty for failing to pass drug tests. Though they are not a silver bullet, Portman believes that the Cure Act's block grants and federal drug courts are another step in the right direction. “I know Ohio will use this funding very successfully because we have so much experience dealing with this problem,” he says. The House of Representatives passed the 21st Century Cures Act on Wednesday in a bipartisan vote the Senate will consider the measure next week. With an advocate as dedicated and experienced as Portman on its side, there is reason to hope that this legislation will be the next victory in the long battle against addiction.,"

","With the   recount under way in Wisconsin, hopeful leftists would have us believe that the Russians, or some other unknown entity, hacked electronic voting machines in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. (Michigan doesn't use electronic voting it is being included in the recount efforts because Wisconsin and Pennsylvania alone wouldn't take enough electoral votes from Trump to swing the election. Trump won Michigan by only about 11, 000 votes.) Ironically, after the 2000 election, which revealed deficiencies in ballot design and counting procedures in Florida and elsewhere, Democrats almost uniformly wanted to force states to spend billions of dollars on electronic voting machines. Now those electronic voting machines are being blamed for what   presidential nominee Jill Stein calls last month's “  election. ” Never mind that Stein and her Democratic allies, including the Clinton campaign, admit they have no evidence of vote fraud or hacking in this year's vote. All the scary stories about electronic voting have one major problem: They are based on an inaccurate understanding of how electronic voting systems work. First of all, none of the systems are hooked up to the Internet. Electronic voting machines are   units results from them are recorded and compiled by humans. Hacking them from Russia would be as difficult as hacking into your computer when it's not connected to the Internet. Even if machines were broken into before the election, precinct election workers would discover this when they use sample votes to check the machines for accuracy before and after the election. Some machines are even randomly tested during Election Day, just in case their programs were set to miscount votes during only voting hours. But let's set aside the virtual impossibility of successfully hacking a machine so that it miscounts votes. Even if that were doable, an awful lot of voting machines would need to have been hacked in Pennsylvania  —   where Trump won by 70, 638 votes, or 1. 17 percent of the total votes cast  —   in order for the election to have been stolen. Obviously, you can't set voting machines to give Trump all of their votes that would just be too obvious. You would have to make subtle changes to a lot of machines. Let's say that a tampered machine is programmed to deduct 1 percent of the total Hillary votes it records from Hillary's column and add them to Trump's. You would have to tamper with almost all of the state's 25, 000 voting machines, which were made by several different companies, in order to account for the margin Trump recorded. If you shifted 2 percent of the tampered machine's total Hillary vote from Hillary to Trump, which would almost certainly attract suspicion, you would still need to tamper with about half of the state's machines. The media has openly lambasted Trump for his unsupported complaints about vote fraud, yet have no such qualms about this Democratic conspiracy theory. Does anyone seriously think that such a degree of conspiracy could have gone unnoticed?,"

","When social justice displaces truth as the core value of academics, bad things happen to science. Professor Jonathan Haidt of NYU has taken the lead in pointing out that freedom of thought, freedom of speech, and viewpoint diversity are particularly necessary if universities are going to fulfill their   mission of serving the cause of truth. He founded Heterodoxacademy. org to help organize resistance from within the world of scholars. We saw that in 2015, when a major study published in Science, which purported to show that personal canvassing by LGBT people had an amazingly large effect on people's opinions, was revealed to have been entirely faked, and in ways that one lone grad student, David Broockman, found easy to debunk. (The “scholar” had even created easily checked fake grants from real foundations, thanking them publicly for grants they had never made.) “In fact, throughout the entire process, until the very last moment when multiple ‘smoking guns' finally appeared, Broockman was consistently told by friends and advisers to keep quiet about his concerns lest he earn a reputation as a troublemaker,” NY magazine reported. But in mid November, Social Science  Medicine published an attempt to replicate the authors' data, which not only failed to replicate the results but could find no legitimate way of interpreting the data that would explain how the authors reached their conclusion: Efforts to replicate Hatzenbuehler et al. 's (2014) key finding on structural stigma's notable influence on the premature mortality of sexual minorities, including a more refined imputation strategy than described in the original study, failed. No data imputation approach yielded parameters that supported the original study's conclusions. Alternative hypotheses, which originally motivated the present study, revealed little new information. In conclusion, the authors note that “ten different approaches to multiple imputation of missing data yielded none in which the effect of structural stigma on the mortality of sexual minorities was statistically significant. ” To heighten the drama, the author of this new study is none other than University of Texas sociologist Mark Regnerus, who was subjected to public abuse for daring to publish, in a   journal, the results of a groundbreaking study suggesting that children raised by gay people fare about as well as children in other, alternative family forms but not as well as children in intact married biological families. (Regnerus was unable to compare children raised from birth by gay couples in an intact relationship because he could find only two examples of such children in his data set, a finding he freely acknowledged in his own published study.) In the weeks since the publication of Regnerus's study attempting to replicate his work, Hatzenbuehler has yet to respond. More Science When Does Life Begin?   ‘Science' Ignores the Facts. The Appalling Delusion of 100 Percent Renewables, ExposedThe Perverse Incentives in University Science FundingPerhaps there is some explanation. Or perhaps, for reasons we can only suspect, Hatzenbuehler (who edited the special journal issue in which his original study was published) slipped a bogus study into a major   journal, confident that nobody would want to review and contest its findings, which so please the overwhelmingly liberal academy. I charitably hope he can explain. But in any case, Mark Regnerus is emerging as a scientific hero, a   Galileo standing up to the new theology of the Left. Science is not   or  . But to work, it needs scientists fearlessly committed to truth over their preferred outcomes.,"

","Natalie Portman's impersonation of Jacqueline Kennedy in the movie Jackie explores the emotional balancing act of a famous woman, wife of the most powerful man in the world, intimate witness to his murder, and inadvertent political player on the field of decorum that was her lot in life. The film itself is a project teetering between fact and legend. Portman empathically portrays the eternal pop icon as someone who was deprived of ever having a private moment. So, every scene  —   setting out the terms of an interview to a journalist or screaming to the universe from the back seat of a   limousine  —   calls for an existential examination. It's a tour de force that works precisely because it doesn't have to be totally convincing, just insightful. Jackie arrives at a moment of transition when the popular perspective on politics, having gone through eight years of   idol worship, now enters a phase of skepticism mixed with suspense. Jackie applies that uncertainty and expectation to its presentation of Jacqueline Kennedy's life after John Fitzgerald Kennedy's assassination, when she could either have collapsed or returned to her origins of   irrelevance. Jackie is not the work of our finest filmmakers it is   compared with other   films (Roger Donaldson and Kevin Costner's Thirteen Days being the best). Yet, surprisingly, director Pablo Larra​í​​n and producer Darren Aronofsky keep their jaded tendencies in check and maintain a relatively humane perspective.  Portman reveals the anxiety behind the famous Andy Warhol lithograph, a pop image that is both blotchy and brittle. Her tiny physique often suggests girlishness, but Portman's nervous composure when speaking before TV cameras in her famous live video tour of the White House when she undresses out of the bloodied “little pink suit” (as it was memorably described in Altman's Nashville) when she changes her mind about walking “with Jack” in the funeral procession  —   all imply a mature emotional struggle so that, even in her Valium haze, the composite image of Jackie (like Warhol's) rouses a distanced sense of condolence and respect. During the Obama era, the biased media granted   to empowered politicians, helping to create a new media aristocracy that is now on the defense. With the renewed mystification of people in public service, our public figures have lost the capacity for   and  . It is Portman's   (and her subject's) that makes Jackie interesting. Bobby Kennedy (Peter Sarsgaard at his most obnoxious) tells Jackie, “Look at you! We're ridiculous. ” Then he says: “You were at the center of it all. It's impossible to have perspective. I assure you it was a spectacle. ” In these lines, we see a shift in subject (from Jackie and Bobby as political players to the funeral itself). Perhaps the move from “you” to “we” to “it” is simply Larraí​n's mistranslation, but Bobby's rant points out the difficulties of achieving America's   particularly as felt by those obliged to represent it.  This insight is especially helpful now. The actor playing JFK (Casper Phillipson) quotes the exact words of JFK himself, to summarize the filmmakers' attitude on political celebrity. Speaking to a CBS news reporter in the now famous 1962 documentary A Tour of the White house with Mrs. John F. Kennedy, JFK said: I think anyone who comes to the White House as the president desires the best for his country. But I think he does receive stimulus from the knowledge of living in close proximity to the people who are legendary but who actually were alive and were in these rooms. That statement goes against the   arrogance sold by trash like The Butler and Selma. But Jackie doesn't entirely avoid sanctimony as balm for the   it ends with Jackie and JFK dancing to Richard Burton singing Camelot  —   a sappy way out of this film's serious, analytic project. ***** So far, it seems that the best cinema this season is to be found in a   advertisement by Wes Anderson titled “Come Together. ” It recalls Anderson's   2006 American Express ad, but the current ad for the HM retail chain is Anderson's best work since The Darjeeling Limited. (For many feature directors, commercials provide    and sketch pads to test ideas  —   pragmatic solutions to ideological quandaries. Anderson has made more than a dozen.) More Movies Inside the Delightful Suicide of GawkerReagan Derangement Syndrome Is Alive and WellIn the   Baby Driver, Hollywood Goes Asperger'sSet on a train during a   detour, Come Together is a humane political allegory that responds to America's   fractiousness. It's an ad, but sells goodwill  —   reminding us of the beneficence that should inspire the season's consumerism: Adrien Brody plays Conductor Ralph, who organizes festivities to unite his disparate North Pole —  arized passengers. This brief tour de force revives Anderson's   whimsy that had lately decayed into   cynicism. Come Together is ebullient, envisioning a unified capitalist future.,"

","A panic is sweeping the land  —   or at least something like it has unnerved CNN, Vox, and other precincts of progressive sensibility. They are alarmed that millions of Americans are being misled by “fake news. ” As someone whose inbox has lately bulged with items about Clinton's impending demise due to a concealed, terminal illness who has shaken her head at “breaking news” that Turkish coup plotters had gotten their hands on NATO nuclear weapons at Incirlik air base and who has sighed at the endless iterations of stories like the “47 Clinton friends who mysteriously turned up dead,” I don't deny that misinformation, disinformation, rumors, and malicious gossip appear to have achieved new salience in the national conversation. I shun   publications and sites that traffic in this sort of drivel. The mainstream press has been soft on Fidel since he first grabbed a pistol and started granting interviews to credulous reporters in the Sierra Maestra. The joke that made the rounds in 1980s was that Castro could have been featured in one of those ads boasting “I got my job through the NY Times!” Starting in 1957, Times reporter Herbert Matthews visited with the rebel leader and published accounts of his selfless commitment to “his” people. “Power does not interest me,” Castro told Matthews. “After victory I want to go back to my village and just be a lawyer again. ” The evidence of Castro's monstrousness was available more or less immediately after his victory. Battista's supporters were shot en masse  —   some in a carnival atmosphere in front of stadiums of people making the thumbs down gesture. Former revolutionary allies were next to mount the scaffold for the modern equivalent of the guillotine. Independent newspapers were closed. Unions were forbidden to strike. Religious colleges were closed and priests were forced into exile (they had plenty of company). Those who resisted the regime were arrested, denied medical care, and sometimes tortured. Their families were harassed. Castro promised free elections within 18 months. That was 708 months ago. Cubans are still waiting.  A sin of omission, you may say. Yes, but there was the other piece  —   the diligent myth tending. As Jay Nordlinger, National Review's indefatigable voice for the oppressed, has pointed out again and again, the myth of Cuba's wonderful, free, universal health care system Will Not Die. Obama lauded it. Michael Moore beatified it. Bernie Sanders cited it to shame the USA by comparison! What can you say to people with such a profound need to believe? Their faith is religious in nature and accordingly very resistant to logic or argument. Again, to cite Jay Nordlinger: There are actually three health services in Cuba. There is one for tourists, featuring state of the art equipment. There is a second for   communists, the military, approved artists, and so forth. This too is a good system. And then there is the squalid, dirty, understaffed, massively   medical system that ordinary Cubans (the vast majority) must endure. In the third system, overworked doctors   latex gloves, antibiotics are scarce, and patients must “bring their own bed sheets, soap, towels, food, light bulbs  —   even toilet paper. ” A 2014 report from the Institute for War and Peace Reporting found that in Cuban hospitals “the floors are stained and surgeries and wards are not disinfected. Doors do not have locks and their frames are coming off. Some bathrooms have no toilets or sinks, and the water supply is erratic. Bat droppings, cockroaches, mosquitoes and mice are all in evidence. ” And yet, even such an august publication as The Atlantic (I say that sincerely) published a piece after Castro's death titled “How Cubans Live as Long as Americans at a Tenth of the Cost. ” You can call it invincible ignorance. You can call it journalistic malpractice. You can even call it “fake news. ”"
80817,121894,The Incoherence of Electoral College Opponents,National Review,Charles Correll III,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/442668/electoral-college-progressive-opponents-incoherent
","Behind the recent clamor for the abolition of the Electoral College are two contradictory sentiments: that the system is antidemocratic and that it is too democratic. Of course the real problem, from the Left's point of view, is that the president is not a Democrat. Political scientist Jack Rakove identified the crux of the argument for adopting the NPV when he remarked that “the electoral weight of the citizen should not vary from one place to another because of the distorting effect of the ‘senatorial bump. '” Political equality dictates that a fair electoral system remove distortions to the value of an individual's vote because otherwise certain citizens hold greater influence than others over each election. This point is crucial in a closely contested election, where the votes of a large minority become worthless under the    rules currently used in 48 states because, as one critic noted, “an individual vote is only as valuable as its ability to influence the majority vote of a state” under the Electoral College. The problem with this is that while its simplicity may appeal to our democratic sense of fairness, the NPV would complicate the process by undervaluing the role of the states in selecting the president. For one thing, in attempting to circumvent the amendment process, the NPV gambles that its interstate compact will not face legal challenges. Even operating on the assumption that such compacts are constitutional, in a close election one candidate or the other would almost certainly challenge the process in a lawsuit, which might require the USA Supreme Court to decide the outcome of a close election  —   “hardly a more ‘democratic' outcome,” as The American Interest pointed out. For another, electing the president is not equivalent to electing a state governor, contrary to the argument put forth by Yale law professor Akhil Reed Amar. Because the president represents a diverse nation, the system by which he is elected must incentivize him to win support from a broad, national coalition of voters. The NPV does not provide that incentive. Instead, according to John Samples, it encourages campaigns “to focus their efforts in dense media markets where costs per vote are lowest. ” For individuals concerned that the value of a vote is proportional to its influence on the majority vote of a state, then, the NPV should be particularly worrisome, because states have a greater likelihood of shifting between the two parties than do large cities. The other camp of liberals opposed to the Electoral College believes that it is too democratic, and is currently engaged in an argument over the extent to which the Framers intended electors to function as a deliberative body checking popular sentiment. Writing in Vox, Michael Singer, mayor of Charlottesville, Virginia, and guest lecture at UVA, explains that we should call participants in the Electoral College “conscientious electors” because their “job” is not “to   the popular vote” but to “investigate and deliberate. ” In this sense, the faithless elector acts faithfully to a higher imperative of representative government: deliberating about right and wrong. It all sounds so Cruzian, until it isn't. According to The Economist, “the Electoral College isn't a deliberative body at all: there is no discussion, just a   vote. ” That these votes take place in fifty separate locations, corresponding to the capitals of the fifty states, further suggests that persuasion and deliberation are not among the utilities of the system. The argument for faithless electors, then, is more precisely an argument for elite opinion checking popular opinion when the former believes the latter has erred in its selection of the president. According to Singer, the point of the faithless elector is not to decide the most qualified candidate, but to provide a “ ” against demagogues. But why, then, are electors selected based on party loyalty rather than wisdom and intellect? Even if one granted proponents of faithless electors that the Electoral College ought to allow greater deliberation about the candidates, it is unclear exactly how independent electors, skeptical of popular   but spread throughout the many states, would make a better choice than the people themselves. As The Economist further noted, separating the votes of electors from the votes that the people cast on Election Day would be “antithetical to democratic principles,” even if electors possessed “a deep understanding of what America needs in a president. ” More importantly, a deliberative body is not immune from the temptations toward demagoguery, even if the demagogue parades around in robes rather than rags. Another UVA man, James Ceaser, noted “by demagoguery, the founders did not mean merely the fomenting of class envy, or harsh, angry appeals to regressive force they also had in mind the softer, more artful designs of a Pericles or a Caesar, who appealed to hopeful expectations. ” Or, as Hamilton described this type of demagogue, “those brilliant appearances of genius and patriotism, which, like transient meteors, sometimes mislead as well as dazzle. ” Demagogues come in all shapes, sizes, and tones. William F. Buckley Jr. said that “if the Constitution is not, as presently understood, resilient enough to cope with the contemporary requirements of survival, then the Constitution should be modified, as it has been before. ” With 27 amendments, it is not outside the realm of possibility that the Electoral College might be an aspect of the Constitution in need of reform, whether it be too democratic or not democratic enough. But if we are to alter that sober expression of public opinion, then we ought to do it in an   fashion, through the Article V amendment process.  —   Charles Correll III is a senior at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va. double majoring in politics and American history.

80818,121895,"Books, ‘As Close to Immortality as the Written Word Can Expect'",National Review,Neal B. Freeman,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/442649/books-reviews-philip-terzian-weekly-standard-literary-editor-publishing
","Philip Terzian, the literary editor of The Weekly Standard since 2005, has become one of the deans of the   trade. He is much admired for his ability to make taste and set trends by suggesting but rarely imposing his own highly cultivated views on matters both aesthetic and ideological. His supervision of the magazine's     pages is not only   but unfashionable, in that he produces the section for readers rather than fellow reviewers. Among readers, that is. He stands in resolute opposition to digital marketers and, especially, to Big Data. He doesn't want to be told what will “fit” with his personal interests he doesn't want to be told what he should read because a computer once recorded his enthusiasm for a similar book. He wants to be surprised and delighted by a book he stumbles across, by a book that may not consolidate an old interest but kindle a new one. He is by his own admission an undisciplined reader and encourages his flock to be equally amateurish. Terzian's political views remain something of a curiosity. One of his early writing gigs was as a speechwriter for the Democratic National Committee but, manifestly, he has grown in office. Ensconced at an intensely political magazine, which is published in a city with hardened political categories  —   Washington, D. C.  —   he has distinguished himself by being predictably unpredictable. Freeman: Give us a sense of the book world today. Are the vital signs strong  —   compared with, say, the sagging fortunes of newspapers? Terzian: The book world seems in reasonable health to me, and whatever trends I can perceive would probably have occurred with or without the Internet. The exception, I suppose, would be the decline of newspaper   sections it's a net loss to readers but hasn't affected publishing. The way we buy books has changed, of course, but just as photography didn't end painting, books are still being commissioned, written, published, and purchased. I guessed a decade ago that certain books might end up exclusively online, and that seems to have happened, but the number of titles has grown, along with small  —   maybe I should call them boutique  —   publishing houses. And best of all, the appetite for books as physical objects, the instinct to own a bound volume, has remained steady. Even among Millennials. Freeman: That's good to hear, and especially for us print dinosaurs. One of the collateral effects of the   of newspapers is that the nation's reporting infrastructure has withered. At the risk of oversimplification, not to say grandiosity, would it be fair to say that books are to understanding what newspapers are to information? Terzian: That's certainly true. Journalists like to say that they're writing “the first draft of history,” and that's a charitable way to describe the difference between information and knowledge. Of course books can be (and often are) just as pernicious as bad journalism. But because journalism is usually a monopoly source of information in any given community, books have a longer, wider, and deeper perspective, they derive from diverse viewpoints, and they're as close to immortality as the written word can expect. Freeman: Well, we will rely on people such as yourself to weed out those pernicious books. Let's talk about those immortal books for a moment. If  —   in a gross miscarriage of justice, obviously  —   you were sentenced to a long term in a penal colony, which four books would you take with you? Terzian: For the purposes of answering an impossible question, I'll stick to imaginative literature: Piers Plowman, by William Langland Seven Men, by Max Beerbohm Murder in the Cathedral, by T. S. Eliot and Babylon Revisited and Other Stories, by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Freeman: Now that I've lured you into   I intend to press my advantage. But first, I have to ask: Why the Fitzgerald? Terzian: I discovered Fitzgerald at the age of twelve  —   initially reading about him in our local library  —   and of course his life and work were just the thing to appeal to an adolescent romantic. The world he describes in those stories  —   the WASP, Ivy League upper middle class of the early to   century and its tribal rites  —   is a lifelong hobby of mine, and his prose is both limpid and jagged. Revisiting those stories never fails to revive the sensation of reading them for the first time. Also, I grew up in the same place where his daughter was then living, and not very far from his burial site. Freeman: We can agree that there's nothing wrong with a little adolescent romanticism in a penal colony. But let's turn now to the Ultimate List. What's on your bedside table these days? Terzian: As you might have guessed, I have a small bookcase at the foot of my bed stocked with perennial favorites  —   Ben Jonson, Faulkner, Dr. Johnson, medieval miracle plays, the Alanbrooke diaries, Our Times, by Mark Sullivan. But new books currently on my nightstand are John Bew's life of Clement Attlee On Human Nature, by the newly knighted Roger Scruton and Language of the Spirit: An Introduction to Classical Music, by Jan Swafford. It really is for beginners, but I'm always interested in whose reputation is soaring or declining at the moment. And I'm partial to anyone who appreciates my favorite composer, Arnold Schoenberg. Freeman: Actually, I wouldn't have guessed. But I'm glad I asked. Let's close with an intramural question. There was major buzz some years ago when the big NY houses, including Random House and Simon and Schuster, launched imprints to tap the “new and rapidly growing” audience of conservative readers. (Who knew that conservatives could read!) How have those imprints fared? And how are conservative books faring in the wider world of mainstream publishing? Terzian: The imprints seem to be thriving, although I would never underestimate the capacity of the publishing industry to inflict economic harm on itself by deliberately ignoring readers or buyers it doesn't want. This applies to bookselling as well as book publishing. My general impression is that the   interest in explicitly “conservative” writing has run its course, as publishers are now giving full voice to   revisionism about American history as well as subjects  —   transgender sexuality, black nationalism, rape culture, hate speech, etc.  —   currently in vogue on campus. Still, the rise of Trump has been as much of a shock to the system as the election of Ronald Reagan. Perhaps it will prompt some curiosity and a new dose of diversity in book publishing. Freeman: Thanks, Phil.,"

","The curtain finally fell on one of Earth's most vicious tormentors of gay people. The seemingly immortal Cuban dictator Fidel Castro died November 25 at age 90. Castro operated a giant Alcatraz from 1959 to 2008 before dynastically handing the jailhouse keys to his dauphin and brother, Raúl. “We would never come to believe that a homosexual could embody the conditions and requirements of conduct that would enable us to consider him a true revolutionary, a true Communist militant,” Castro declared in 1965. “A deviation of that nature clashes with the concept we have of what a militant Communist should be,” Castro added, as James Kirchick recalled in Sunday's Daily Beast. Castro started corralling gays that year, often through cruel lies. These Military Units to Aid Production or UMAPs, by their Spanish acronym, used forced labor to   gays, Jehovah's Witnesses, and others deemed deficient in socialist fervor. Signs at these facilities announced: “Work will make you men. ” UMAP inmates, according to Butterworth, reported being “threatened with execution, stuffed with dirt in their mouths, buried in the ground up to their necks, and tied up naked outside in barbed wire without food or water until fainting. ” “It was a sweltering place without a bathroom,” Reinaldo Arenas, a gay Cuban author, wrote in his autobiography, Before Night Falls. “Gays were not treated like human beings, they were treated like beasts. They were the last ones to come out for meals, so we saw them walk by, and the most insignificant incident was an excuse to beat them mercilessly. ” Castro erected his own Gulag Archipelago of some 200 such UMAP camps before ending this program in 1968. But his   homophobia raged on. Former UMAP inmates were identified as such in their official records. This blocked them from workplaces and classrooms. The first National Congress on Education and Culture in 1971 decried “all manifestations of homosexual deviation. ” Openly gay Cubans, particularly teachers, were barred from the Communist Party and booted from their jobs. While Castro's regime decriminalized consensual gay sex in 1979, it struck a major blow for inhumanity when it corralled HIV patients and forcibly quarantined them in sanitaria between the mid 1980s and 1993. The late Jonathan Mann, M. D.  —   founder of the World Health Organization's Program for AIDS  —   condemned these as “pretty prisons. ” Castro's abuses continued in 1997 when Human Rights Watch found that the Marxist dictator “heightened harassment of homosexuals, raiding several nightclubs known to have gay clientele and allegedly beating and detaining dozens of patrons. ” More Fidel Castro In America, a Thousand Little CastrosThe Media Has Been Reporting Fake News about Castro and Cuba for YearsAbout Fidel Castro, from One Who KnowsCastro incarcerated dissident poet Armando Valladares from 1960 to 1982 for not placing on his office desk a sign that read “I'm with Fidel. ” Valladares said, “There have been few examples of repression of homosexuals in history as virulent as in Cuba. ” Since Fidel stepped aside in 2008, gays in Cuba have been given more breathing room. Mariela Castro has emerged as a   advocate. As Raúl's heterosexual daughter and Fidel's niece, she enjoys a very long leash. “Yes, there were moments of great injustice  —   great injustice,” Fidel finally conceded to the Mexican newspaper La Jornada in 2010, at age 84. He added that “if anyone has to take responsibility, I take mine. I will not hold anyone else responsible. ” On Sunday, an urn bearing Fidel Castro's ashes will be interred in Santiago, Cuba. How fitting for a tyrant who burns in Hell.,"
80820,121898,SCOTUS Debates Releasing Criminal Aliens,National Review,Michael Hethmon,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/442662/scotus-case-due-process-criminal-aliens
","The Supreme Court on Wednesday grappled with the complex question of how to ensure that criminal aliens, having served their prison sentences and been detained in immigration custody while their removal proceedings take place, do not languish for years without the opportunity to request release on bond. The case, Jennings vs. Rodriguez, makes clear just how difficult it is to balance   protections with the Congress's mandate that criminal aliens should be removed from the USA as quickly as possible. On one side, there is the government, arguing for more latitude to carry out Congress's will. On the other, there is a large number of criminal aliens held in   centers in California and designated as “class action”  by a federal district judge in Los Angeles in 2014. The plaintiffs are subject to mandatory detention while the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) works to obtain a final “removal order” from an immigration judge authorizing their deportation. In 2014, the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI) submitted several amicus briefs to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which was attempting to answer the same questions for aliens detained outside of California during an earlier phase of the same class action, the Robbins v. Rodriguez litigation. IRLI argued then against the validity of the class action and the imposition of a “clear and convincing” standard of proof of flight risk and dangerousness to the community in bond redetermination hearings for aliens held under mandatory detention. IRLI emphasized the constitutionality of Congress' mandate to apply different standards for review of mandatory detention in    cases. Although the Obama administration has aggressively pursued   administrative relief for huge swaths of the   population, it chose to appeal the Ninth Circuit's decision certifying the class, which accepted the argument put forth by the class's ACLU attorneys that removable aliens have full constitutional   rights, and thus can't be held for long periods without bond hearings. It did so for three main reasons: (1) The decision conflicted with the   laws passed by Congress (2) the Ninth   standard  —   that DHS must prove “by clear and convincing evidence” that the criminal aliens it wished to detain were exceptionally dangerous and   or else release them into the USA  —   imposed a higher burden of proof on prosecutors than the one most of them had previously had to meet in criminal cases and (3) any unusual cases where a criminal alien might be detained for longer than necessary to complete removal proceedings could be righted through a habeas corpus hearing. The justices had questions about all aspects of the case, with Ginsberg, Kagan, and especially Sotomayor asking why it wouldn't be a good idea for the Court to accept the     standard, ensuring “administrative constitutionality” for the entire detention system and preventing any constitutional violations arising from “prolonged detention. ” For DHS, the Solicitor General replied that the answer is found in Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion in Demore v. Kim (2003) which held that the proper constitutional standard for review of mandatory detention is whether there has been a delay suggesting that the purpose of the detention is nefarious and not to effect the removal process. He contended that it is not the date of detention, but whether it is no longer related to the removal process that raises constitutional concerns. The real problem, he argued was that the Ninth Circuit imposed a novel single standard and applied it to “everybody,” regardless of the actual reason for each individual's delay. Justices Alito and Roberts focused on the problem caused by the case reaching the Supreme Court as a class action based on a   ruling that the statute was suspect, but not actually unconstitutional. Roberts was concerned that any remedy based on a new temporal limit that the Court tried to impose would be tantamount to legislating from the bench, even if it might be “administratively convenient” for detained aliens going forward. For the aliens to prevail, Justices Kennedy and Breyer would likely have to agree to impose a   limit on mandatory detention on constitutional grounds. But even if they joined a   majority, it seems unlikely that they would be persuaded to accept the very demanding terms of the Ninth Circuit's order in crafting constitutional rules for prolonged detention of this class of criminal aliens. The stage is set, then, for a SCOTUS decision that could be enormously consequential in the early days of Trump's presidency. If enough of the Ninth Circuit's decision becomes the law of the land, the backlog of bond hearings in America's immigration courts will get larger, and thousands of criminal aliens could be released onto the streets. Stay tuned. Editor's Note: This piece has been amended since its initial publication.,"
80821,121902,"No, the Swamp Won't Be Drained",National Review,Rich Lowry,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/442647/donald-trump-draining-swamp-may-not-be-possible
","It wasn't quite “build the wall” or “lock her up,” but “drain the swamp” was a signature Trump slogan. It evoked visions of    influence peddlers getting pulled from their Georgetown cocktail parties en masse and tossed into the Potomac River, as Washington returned to the   burg it was 100 years ago, a humbled and more righteous town. The swamp will endure it always does. This doesn't mean that a Trump administration can't make the swamp a little less important. The meaning of “drain the swamp” is pleasingly inexact (Ronald Reagan used the phrase, and so has Nancy Pelosi). The Left has, absurdly, chosen to read Trump's use of the slogan as an implicit pledge not to hire anyone who is wealthy. So the nominations of Steven Mnuchin as treasury secretary, Wilbur Ross as commerce secretary, and Betsy DeVos as education secretary are criticized as proof Trump never meant it. (Although the charge against Mnuchin, who worked for Goldman Sachs for 17 years, has more force. The job of treasury secretary almost seems to be the endowed Goldman Sachs chair of the U. S. government. And you could be forgiven for thinking candidate Trump had a dim view of anyone associated with Goldman, given how he excoriated Ted Cruz  —   “puppet!”  —   for his connections to the institution.) Trump's formal   platform consists of a few more strictures on lobbyists. These proposed rules may be salutary, but they are typical of restrictions periodically imposed in Washington and that lobbyists are expert at getting around and surviving. (What are lobbyists for, if not finding loopholes?) The fact is that in a country with an enormous federal government and a First Amendment that guarantees the right to petition the government, the swamp is always going to be extensive and miasmic. As long as there is so much power and money in D. C. the lobbyists, the consultants, the associations, the media   the contractors, and the courtiers will gather and jockey for influence here. There is no neutron bomb that can be set off to vaporize them. A proper   agenda should consist of two things. First, and most fundamentally, it should seek to reduce the size of the federal government, and cut regulations and make them as simple as possible. The more government does, the more incentive every special interest has to hire swamp creatures, for both protection and advantage. And the more complex government is, the more opportunity those creatures have to thrive in niches unknown or poorly understood by everyone except insiders. Second, and more specifically, the federal government should be wrenched out of its cozy relationship with large, established businesses and institutions in areas ranging from health care to finance to education. This agenda would have the advantage of uniting the conservatives (whose animating passion is reducing the size of government) and the populists (whose animating passion is combating a “rigged” system). A number of Trump's cabinet picks point in this direction. But it's not clear where Trump will ultimately go. If he replaces Obama's liberal industrial policy focused on green energy with his own populist industrial policy focused on traditional manufacturing, as suggested by the Carrier deal, he will just spend and subsidize in different ways. In other words, he won't truly drain the swamp, but simply feed different alligators.,"

","Viacom's new chief executive, Bob Bakish, is joining a conga line of big media companies weighing a plan to acquire an interest in Vice, the   news and pop culture destination that has been expanding around the globe, The Post has learned. Bakish wants to make his mark on the struggling media giant and is out to show his board that he has a vision for an independently run Viacom should current merger talks with CBS Corp. fall through, sources said. Viacom and CBS are both controlled by the Redstone family, which would like to bring the two firms back together. But Bakish is bending Shari Redstone's ear about giving him time to see his vision to fruition, sources said. Should Viacom move forward on a plan to buy a piece of Vice, it would essentially be acquiring a firm that it once owned under former CEO Tom Freston. Freston is a financial backer of Vice. In June, Freston told CNBC that, “In 2006, [Viacom CEO Philippe] Dauman let a key piece of Vice go for $3 million. ” Vice is now worth roughly $4. 5 billion. “Furthermore, had Dauman kept that piece of Vice, they would have had a   platform in the digital world,” Freston told CNBC. “They'd have a home for the Nickelodeon graduates. ” To be sure, Viacom has a number of issues that would thwart such an investment in Shane Smith's startup  —   not least its poor credit rating and lack of cash. Still, said one industry source: “Strategically, it would be the best thing in the world for Bakish to buy” into Vice. In another wrinkle for Viacom, CBS has also held initial talks about a Vice buy, The Post has learned. “CBS has had a number of meetings [on Vice],” a source said. “Viacom and CBS have both eyed it. Shane would love to take over MTV. ” Vice's assets include a web and TV operation based in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Separately, several sources told The Post that Disney does not appear to be moving forward on a plan to acquire any more than its current 23 percent stake in Vice. A Wall Street Journal story in August suggested Disney was highly likely to acquire the entire business and that may still be part of a   plan. But for now, sources confirm, there are, “no active conversations” on that front. Vice's other backers include WPP and 21st Century Fox. Time Warner also discussed a possible swap of its HLN cable channel, but talks foundered over valuation. Time Warner's HBO currently airs Vice documentaries and a daily news show. Reps at Viacom and CBS and Vice had no comment."

The $62 million Falcon 9 rocket blew up on its launchpad in Cape Canaveral, Fla. just after 9 a. m. during a test for a planned Saturday  . No one was reported injured in the blast, which occurred near NASA's Kennedy Space Center. But the epic fail sent Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg into a funk during his tour of Kenya, where he was touting his plan to use the     satellite to provide Internet service across   Africa. Facebook had planned to partner with the French satellite operator Eutelsat Communications for the project, part of the   Internet. org program. “I'm deeply disappointed to hear that SpaceX's launch failure destroyed our satellite that would have provided connectivity to so many entrepreneurs and everyone else across the continent,”  . “Fortunately, we have developed other technologies like Aquila that will connect people as well,” he added, referring to a   drone that Facebook plans to use to beam Internet access into remote areas. “We remain committed to our mission of connecting everyone, and we will keep working until everyone has the opportunities this satellite would have provided. ” The blast dealt a major blow to SpaceX, which was facing a backlog of more than $10 billion worth of launch orders after an accident last year. It's also a setback for NASA, which depended on the private company for missions to the International Space Station. Musk, the billionaire Tesla CEO who founded SpaceX in 2002 with the goal of slashing launch costs to make travel to Mars affordable, said the cause of the accident was not yet known. “Loss of Falcon vehicle today during propellant fill operation. Originated around upper stage oxygen tank,”  . SpaceX  “Per standard procedure, the pad was clear and there were no injuries,” the statement said. The destruction of the rocket and its payload could not have come at a worse time for Musk, who wants to merge automaker Tesla with energy company SolarCity, where he is chairman, amid a serious cash crunch. He lost about $390 million in shares as the stocks of two companies plummeted after the explosion, CNBC reported. Musk also faces a government probe of a fatal crash involving a Tesla Model S in Florida in which the driver used the vehicle's controversial Autopilot feature. SpaceX had been due to launch its 29th Falcon 9 early Saturday, carrying the satellite owned by Israel's Space Communication. The rocket exploded as operators were preparing to test fire its nine main engines, with the craft remaining on the pad, the Florida Today news site reported. Falcon 9s are used to ferry supplies to the International Space Station for NASA, so the blast represented a major setback for the agency's plans for cargo hauls and, ultimately, astronaut flights. SpaceX is one of two companies shipping supplies to the space station 250 miles above Earth and is competing with Boeing to fly the first crew there. It had hoped to launch two astronauts on a test flight within a year. “NASA still is assessing what impacts, if any, the incident will have on future missions,” spokesman Michael Curie said. SpaceX began launching Falcon 9 rockets in June 2010, racking up 27 successful flights. The only   failure occurred in June 2015, when a strut broke in the rocket's upper stage, causing a tank to rupture. The company plans to fly its first unmanned spacecraft to Mars in 2018 and send people to the Red Planet as early as 2024. Meanwhile, the mishap threatened to derail the sale of Space Communications for $285 million to Beijing Xinwei Technology Group  —   an agreement the companies said was contingent on a successful launch and the completion of orbital tests.

The country, which faces a declining birth rate that's putting its economy in danger, is urging anyone who can make a baby to do so on Sept. 22. “Fertility is a common good,” the campaign urges. The initiative hasn't quite been as seductive as the Ministry hoped,  . In fact, it's prompted so much backlash on Twitter, where angry users have ripped the campaign using the hashtag #FertilityDay for the past 24 hours, that its founders are backpedaling. The Ministry has since removed the initiative's Web site (fertilityday2016. it) but the bizarre and even offensive images created for the campaign live on. One ad urges, “Beauty knows no age. Fertility does. ” Another reads: “Young parents. The best way to be creative. ” With the unemployment rate at 42 percent for Italians ages of 15 to 24,   that there may be better ways to get creative than popping out a kid you can't afford. She argues that Italy's efforts would be better spent making it easier for women to balance motherhood and work. But where Italy has crashed and burned, other   countries have had a little more success. Danish travel company Spies Rejser made news when it launched a “Do it for Denmark” campaign, offering prizes to Danes who became pregnant while on vacation. The reason, according to the company: Denmark's stunningly low birthrate of 10 babies per 1, 000 residents in 2013. The company launched a   campaign in 2015, “Do it for Mom,” that urged parents to send their married children on vacation to, you got it, make some grandkids.   launching their own   campaign to remind residents that fertility doesn't last forever. The campaigns seem to have worked  —     there was a small spike in births nine months after the latest campaign.  Before that, Russia invited Boyz II Men to play a concert in Moscow on Feb. 6, 2013  —   enough time to “hopefully give Russian men some inspiration ahead of St. Valentine's Day,”  .  The concert was part of president Vladimir Putin's attempts to raise the country's declining birth rate. No word on whether the boy band caused a baby boom."

90410,135213,Letting terrorists off the hook for killing Americans,NY Post,Seth Lipsky,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://nypost.com/2016/09/01/letting-terrorists-off-the-hook-for-killing-americans/,"It looks like there's a new red line in the Middle East. It has been laid down by the Second US Circuit Court of Appeals, which just let the Palestinian Authority off the hook for killing Americans. It's a stunning decision that may be the beginning of the end of a   effort to use civil law to hold accountable those responsible for the murder of Americans abroad. What a bitter pill for surviving families who turned to the courts when our presidents refused to act. What fodder, too, for our presidential campaign, in which the kind of federal judges we want is one of the issues. The three judges who just ruled for the Palestinians were appointed by Bill Clinton and Obama. The case involves an effort by 11 American families who, after losing loved ones in terror attacks in Israel, sued the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority. They won big last year in federal district court in Brooklyn. This particular case involved several different attacks. The most famous of the group was the 2002 bombing of a cafeteria at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. That attack killed nine and wounded around 100 others. Five American students were among the dead. Not only did a jury find that the Palestinians had done the deeds but they awarded $218. 5 million in damages. Under the law, known as the   Act, the damages were automatically tripled, to $655. 5 million. The appeals judges threw all that out on the grounds that the district court never should have asserted its jurisdiction over the case in the first place. It instructed the lower court to dismiss the claims. It's not my purpose here to get into the fine points of federal law on which the judges ruled in this case. I've been warning for years of the disappointments that are going to accrue if we leave the war to civil court. That began in the 1990s, when a Brandeis coed from New Jersey, Alisa Flatow, was slain in Israel in a bus bombing backed by Iran. Her heroic father, Stephen Flatow, eventually won a legal judgment of $247 million. The Clinton administration actually fetched up in court to oppose Flatow's efforts to collect on the judgment. It feared that the court would upset diplomatic immunity. It bought out the Flatow claim for six cents on the dollar, yet now we're shipping billions to Iran. This latest case involves attacks by Palestinians against Americans and which the Palestinian Authority praised and the perpetrators of which it rewarded financially. Yet America has launched no military strikes against the Palestinian regime, or even against Hamas, which claimed credit for murdering the Americans. Instead, it hectors Israel against “disproportionate” responses to terror and tries to get it to be more forthcoming in negotiations. No wonder the families tried civil law. The   Act, under which they sought justice, provides that any American national injured by international terrorism  —   or his estate or heirs  —   can sue. When they won in lower court, though, Obama had his deputy secretary of state file a declaration in court warning against getting too tough. It's a classic example of the administration's thinking. Team Obama insisted that it supports “just compensation” for families of those the Palestinian terrorists killed or injured. It's just that the administration has “significant concerns” about the “harms that could arise. ” It was worried that the Palestinian Authority's ability to operate as a government might become “severely compromised. ” Even, it seems, if Congress didn't share that worry when it passed the   Act. How much, if at all, the administration's declaration swayed the appeals court is hard to gauge. In the end, the judges said that “no matter how horrendous” the attacks on the Americans, the lower court had gone beyond the limits allowed by the Constitution. So 14 years after the Americans were killed or injured, the survivors and their loved ones are out of luck. One of their lawyers, Kent Yalowitz, called it a “cruel decision,” noting that the very terrorists who prompted the   law have now avoided responsibility. The Palestinian Arabs are gloating. Reuters is quoting their regime's finance minister, Shukri Bishara, as calling the Second Circuit's decision “a big blow to anyone who attempts to blackmail us. ” “We have drawn a red line under it,” Bishara added, just to bring the matter full circle. It's an ironical turn of phrase, given how Obama and Clinton seem to feel about red lines."
90461,135266,Woman finds mummified remains of grandson in attic,NY Post,Joshua Rhett Miller,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://nypost.com/2016/12/02/woman-finds-mummified-remains-of-grandson-in-attic/,"A Pennsylvania woman found the mummified remains of her grandson in her attic  —   two years after the man suddenly went missing, authorities said. Zanobia Richmond discovered the corpse of Dyquain Rogers, 21  —   who was reported missing in November 2014  —   after she heard a thump on the top floor of her Erie County home, officials said. She called police immediately after making the gruesome find. “They were mummified,” Erie County Coroner Lyell Cook told The Post of the remains. “The lack of airflow and the fact that the attic wasn't vented  —   those conditions were optimal for dehydration and mummification. ” Officials did not release a cause of death, but sources said it appeared Rogers had hanged himself. Cook, the county's coroner of 16 years, said his office rarely sees cases involving mummified bodies. “It is unusual, we don't see much of that,” he said. “They're very rare. ” Cook said there's no evidence of foul play, saying there's “nothing to suggest anything other than suicide” in the case. But some of Rogers' relatives had to be convinced that he took his own life, including his aunt, who organized early efforts to find him when he originally disappeared. Erica     on Thursday that she now accepts suicide as her nephew's cause of death after initially calling for an autopsy, saying she “didn't believe” that Rogers killed himself. “I have to accept it now because that is what they said,”   told the newspaper, referring to police, Cook and another one of Roger's relatives. “I really don't want to accept it. ” After questioning the initial suicide ruling on Wednesday, Rogers told the newspaper she no longer disputes Cook's finding. “I did all I could do,” she said. “I must accept it as it is. ” Cops who investigated the case back in November 2014 searched the inside and outside grounds of 2506 German St. where the body was found, according to reports in the case cited by detectives Thursday. But the reports do not indicate whether officers at the time checked the attic, the Erie   reports. “All indications are that [Rogers] wasn't there when our guys were there,” Erie Police Chief Donald Dacus said of the original search. “He returned at some point wearing different clothing. ” Dacus said investigators believe Rogers' body was in the attic for most of the time that he was missing. “The difficult part is we will never have the answers,” he said. Rogers, who graduated Central Career and Technical School in Erie in 2012, volunteered at a local fire department and worked as an assistant manager at a pizza shop in the western Pennsylvania town. His aunt said he didn't appear suicidal and was looking into joining the Navy or to work as an emergency medical technician. Rogers had been “having the worst luck lately,”    —   just days before he was reported missing. “If you are going to throw your life away, why are you going to do all these things?”   told the Erie   in March."
90680,135502,The real reason for NY City's traffic nightmare,NY Post,"Shawn Cohen, Yoav Gonen and Laura Italiano",2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://nypost.com/2016/12/02/new-york-citys-traffic-is-intentionally-horrible/,"Time for some traffic problems in Manhattan! City officials have intentionally   with the hidden purpose of making drivers so miserable that they leave their cars at home and turn to mass transit or bicycles,   sources told The Post. Today's gridlock is the result of an effort by the Bloomberg and de Blasio administrations over more than a decade of redesigning streets and ramping up police efforts, the sources said. “The traffic is being engineered,” a former top NYPD official told The Post, explaining a   plan that began under Mayor Mike Bloomberg and hasn't slowed with Mayor de Blasio. “The city streets are being engineered to create traffic congestion, to slow traffic down, to favor bikers and pedestrians,” the former official said. “There's a reduction in capacity through the introduction of bike lanes and streets and lanes being closed down. ” The concerted effort includes: The goal of the jammed traffic is to shift as many drivers as possible to public transit or bicycles. An added benefit was supposed to be safer streets, but city officials have said that while 45, 000 fewer cars and trucks now come into Midtown daily than in 2010, pedestrian deaths are on the uptick this year. The driver headaches began under Bloomberg in 2003, with his THRU Streets program that prohibits drivers from turning onto most avenues from nine Midtown cross streets during weekday hours. Bloomberg then tried to drastically cut vehicle traffic with a   program that would have charged drivers to enter Midtown. Albany nixed that plan in 2007, and the next year, Bloomberg changed tactics. He again targeted drivers with his ambitious Green Light for Midtown Project, which, starting in 2009, installed   redesigns of Columbus Circle, Broadway, Times Square and Herald Square. Green Light includes pedestrian plazas and protected bike lanes that are still being completed under de Blasio, who has further snarled traffic with reduced speed limits, redesigned intersections and aggressive   as part of his Vision Zero initiative. “This all goes back to when Bloomberg wasn't getting his congestion pricing, so they started doing others things,” a second source said. “They're not coming out and saying it, but they're doing other things to cut down on traffic coming into city, things such as taking streets that had four lanes and making them three by creating bike lanes, or putting a plaza in, creating pedestrian islands,” the source said. “They're purposefully cutting down on the number of vehicles coming into the city by cutting down the space for vehicles. ” The source said de Blasio “doesn't care about traffic” and noted that the mayor could now blame congestion on   Trump, whose Trump Tower in Midtown is now ringed with security. “He really doesn't care,” the source said. “Instead of working around it and helping it out, he'll just blame everything on Trump. ” Adding to the gridlock, traffic agents are being ordered to focus more on writing tickets and less on keeping vehicles moving, a former NYPD   officer said. “Almost nobody's doing traffic direction anymore. Everybody's focused on enforcement of parking violations,” said the former officer, who was a liaison with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The NYPD declined to comment. ‘The city streets are being engineered to create traffic congestion, to slow traffic down, to favor bikers and pedestrians.' De Blasio spokesman Austin  Finan on Friday denied any effort by City Hall to slow down cars. “The notion that we want or are somehow ‘engineering' traffic congestion is absurd,” he said. “Economic growth, record tourism, construction activity and a growing population means our streets are overburdened like never before. “DOT and NYPD work extremely hard to keep NYers moving on our streets safely and efficiently by foot, bus, car and bike. ” Still, Manhattan has become a vehicular hell where drivers suffer an average speed of 8. 2 mph. Among them was Braulio Cefea, who was stuck in a traffic jam on the Manhattan side of the Queens Midtown Tunnel Friday. “This is a bad idea,” he said of Midtown's intentional traffic snarls. “Bad, bad idea!” Troy Johnson, 29, sitting in the same traffic jam, was furious at the insiders' allegations of an effort by City Hall to clog traffic. “If it's true,” he said, “you are going to see some serious road rage!”"
90705,135528,Obama's pathetic ‘Blame Fox' excuse,NY Post,Joe Simonson,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://nypost.com/2016/12/02/obamas-pathetic-blame-fox-excuse/,"It's been a rough few weeks for Obama. Voters in   “Blue Wall” states seemingly rejected the vast majority of the president's legacy.  Whether it was ObamaCare, lax immigration enforcement or the Trans Pacific Partnership, millions of voters (many of whom voted for him in 2008 and 2012) decided they didn't want to hand the White House keys over to someone who campaigned almost entirely on the status quo. Voters told Obama and the Democrats that they were out of touch with their concerns. So how did the president respond? Essentially: It's all Fox News' fault. As he put it in a recent interview with Rolling Stone, the reason Democrats can't attract voters beyond the East and West coasts isn't their policies but the fact that “Fox News [is] in every bar and restaurant in big chunks of the country. ” Sure, Mr. President, millions of Americans across the country leave their jobs and homes at the end of the day, go to their neighborhood eatery or watering hole, watch “The O'Reilly Factor” and have their brains washed. Please.  The president is just making this up. Truth is, Obama  —   like other top Democrats  —   probably hasn't been to many bars in the last eight years, even if he doesn't mind declaring what's on their televisions and how they're being secretly turned against his party. There is, of course, no conspiracy by the diner and bar owners of America to broadcast one single news channel, even if many do. But the president's repeated singling out of a single network should concern all Americans, not just conservatives.  Fox News has been a consistent target for Obama's frustrations, blaming the network, as he did in September, for creating a “very polarized society” and “churning out a lot of misinformation on a regular basis. ”  The president's recent hits on Fox just add to his long, pathological fixation on the cable news network. Even back in 2009, as   obtained by Judicial Watch later showed, the Obama administration tried excluding Fox News from an interview with a Treasury Department official. The behavior was so nakedly prejudicial toward the network that other members of the White House press pool refused to participate in the interview if Fox wasn't allowed. And conservatives are the ones responsible for a toxic media environment?  Oddly, Obama doesn't think progressive media plays much of a role here  —   except that he thinks one way to help Democrats win elections is to make progressive causes “attract more eyeballs and make it more interesting and more entertaining and more persuasive. ” While the John Olivers and Samantha Bees of the world may not be among the more persuasive (or even entertaining) surrogates for the Democratic cause, it's absurd to suggest the key to future political victories hinges on more talented entertainers lobbying for transgender bathroom access.  But the president goes further. The guy who ran one of the most   campaigns in 2008 and 2012 doesn't seem to like the Internet anymore  —   at least when it helps his political adversaries win. “The challenge,” according to Obama, “is people are getting a hundred different visions of the world from a hundred different outlets. ” Sounds pretty good to me. The president isn't too comfortable with regular people having their own soapbox. No, the response to the democratizing of media, in Obama's eyes, is “figuring out how [to] organize in a virtual world” and “better civics education for our kids. ”  In other words, one bad election (for Democrats) means society, and the government, has to reevaluate its relationship with news outlets.  There's no better way to put it: The president is stoking the flames of censorship. Instead of focusing on policy, helping the nation heal or just . . . going away, he's pointing blame for his party's failures at the press.  For all the talk about Trump's contentious relationship with the media, Obama's language and actions toward Fox News and other conservative media outlets is just, if not more, toxic. If you don't agree with Obama's policy on   reform, you must be some ignorant yahoo. Here's some advice for the president: Instead of lambasting Fox News or something an aide saw once on social media, maybe take some time and think about why so many Americans are turning away from the mainstream media.  You might learn something, and your team might start winning again, too."

Investors drove the stock to   lows after the global smartphone leader told Reuters late on Wednesday the shipments had been delayed for quality control testing, and that shipments to South Korea's top three mobile carriers had been halted. Faults with the new premium flagship device could deal a major blow to the South Korean giant, which was counting on the Galaxy Note 7 to maintain its strong mobile earnings momentum against Apple Inc's new iPhones expected to be unveiled next week. “This is some major   for Samsung, especially given all of the   excitement that products like the Note 7 have been garnering lately,” IDC analyst Bryan Ma said. “The pending Apple launch puts all the more pressure for them to contain this quickly. The timing of this couldn't have been worse. ” Samsung did not comment on what problem it was trying to address or whether other markets were affected besides South Korea. Sister company Samsung SDI said that while it was a supplier of Galaxy Note 7 batteries, it had received no information to suggest the batteries were faulty. Several people posted images and videos of charred Galaxy Note 7s online and said their phones had caught on fire. “Be careful out there, everyone rocking the new Note 7, might catch fire y'all,” one user said in a YouTube clip showing a burnt Note phone. It was not immediately possible to confirm the veracity of the clip. Samsung's shares, which hit a record high of 1. 694 million won last week, fell 2 percent, and Samsung SDI tumbled 6. 1 percent, versus a 0. 1 percent fall for the broader market. Several South Korean media reports, without citing direct sources, said Samsung will soon announce a plan to recall affected Note 7 phones and replace their batteries as opposed to giving the users a new device. A Samsung spokesman declined to comment on the reports. Last year, production problems for the curved displays for the Galaxy S6 edge model resulted in disappointing sales, and Samsung risks a repeat this year if it cannot address the Galaxy Note 7 problems quickly. Its mobile profit is on track to post annual growth for the first time in three years, thanks to robust sales of the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge devices that it launched in March to critical acclaim. The Galaxy Note 7 received similar praise, raising expectations for strong sales in the second half. Samsung said in August demand for the new handset, priced at $882 in South Korea, was far exceeding supply, pushing the firm to delay the launch in some markets. HDC Asset Management fund manager Park   said it now appeared inevitable that Samsung's smartphone average selling price and profits would miss lofty   expectations. “Apple is supposed to show off the iPhone 7 next week and this issue has emerged, so the current state of things do not look good,” he said. Though a components   will buttress overall profits, Park said mobile operating profit might decline by up to 200 billion won for  . The mobile division accounted for about 54 percent of Samsung Electronics'   operating profit of 14. 8 trillion won. Hyundai Securities said in a report that the Galaxy Note 7's problems should be resolved within a “few weeks”. The brokerage retained its   operating profit forecast of 8. 5 trillion won."

It's labeled penthouse 88 and is on the 88th floor. They also bought a “staff” apartment on the 29th floor of the city's tallest residential building for $1. 32 million. The full floor apartment comes with a woodburning fireplace, and the signature    foot windows  —   even in the bathrooms, which have radiant heated floors. The news comes after a Saudi national, retail mogul Fawaz al Hokair,   as the likely buyer of an $87. 6 million penthouse on the building's 96th floor. The unit went into contract in 2013 and closed earlier this year. Starchitect Rafael Vinoly smartly designed the building to reflect the city's grid. The building  —   the tallest residential structure in the world  —   comes with amenities that include a pool, spa and a private   restaurant from   chef Shaun Hergatt. The Sanders' brokers were Robby Browne, Chris Kann and Jennifer Ireland of the Corcoran Group. Other 432 Park buyers include Qatari diplomat Nassi Abdulazziz   Bennett LeBow, chairman of Douglas Elliman's parent company, Vector Group, and Vector's CEO, Howard Lorber.

But the    NYer prefers to stick to doing what she does best  —   singing and performing. On Saturday at the Beacon Theatre, she's headlining the annual “Home for the Holidays” show, now in its sixth year and featuring Smashing Pumpkins singer Billy Corgan, Sharon Van Etten, psychic Theresa Caputo and more. Here, the “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun” singer tells The Post about her memories of growing up in Queens, her son's career and her mom's Catholic guilt. We have pilot programs aimed at helping kids before they run away. It sends a message to these kids who feel like they're thrown away, and think they don't count. When people feel of worth, they can contribute to our country. The last time I went, there were a lot of Indian families there, and the buildings were painted in great colors  —   and that was very exciting to me. When I was a kid, the neighborhood was a   class, white area. My friend Edward lived around the corner, and he was  . In fourth grade, we walked to school together and we listened to Motown. But we couldn't play together, because you didn't want to start trouble. It was a crazy time. I went to Catholic schools  —   one was in Queens and one [was] in Tarrytown  —   but I got thrown out twice. I think it was because of political differences! I think my mother thought we were gonna go to hell because she was divorced, so she put us in a convent school. She thought we were going to be saved, but the nuns . . . oh, they were angry. They had problems! I never tried to advise him. When you're a teenager, you're not looking for advice from your parents  —   you want to do your own thing. It's hard for any kid, especially when you have famous parents. So I never talk about anything I ever did in my career.

Stringer, who manages the city's   worth $45 million, sent a letter to the company demanding corporate governance reform to boost oversight and accountability. The five city unions that help run the pension funds  —   including the United Federation of Teachers  —   signed off on the Stringer letter. “The EpiPen debacle appears to be the costly consequence of weak board oversight of management decisions that prioritize   profit at the expense of   value creation,” Stringer said in the   leader to Dougas Leech, chair of Mylan's nominating and governance committees. The price of a   of EpiPen shot up from $100 in 2007 to $600 today, igniting a public backlash. Meanwhile the compensation of Mylan CEO Heather Bresch skyrocketed from $2. 45 million in 2007 to $18. 9 million today  —   a 671 percent increase. Stringer noted that the comptroller's office and the city pension funds have “consistently opposed the company's pay practices, voting against its pay plan at the past four annual meetings. ” He also said it's time to replace company lackeys on its oversight board and replace them with independent board members to bolster accountability. “Mylan's gross mismanagement of its EpiPen pricing strategy exacerbates the company's protracted history of weak board oversight, which has prompted both widespread investor concerns and repeated opposition votes and shareowner proposals by the NYC Funds,” Stringer said. “Mylan faces a critical juncture,” the comptroller added, noting the public backlash and outrage in Congress over the company's “astronomical price increases” for a   product. He noted the company's stock dropped 10 percent in the last month and badly trails the performance of other Big Pharma stocks. Mylan released a statement in response: “Mylan's Board is comprised of highly qualified, experienced and diverse individuals, including 10 independent directors. The Board has been actively engaged in overseeing the execution of Mylan's growth strategy over the past decade  —   a strategy which has brought hundreds of products to the market, saving patients and the U. S. healthcare system hundreds of millions of dollars; grown our business globally; and expanded access to high quality medicines to patients around the world, all while delivering significant value for Mylan's shareholders and other stakeholders. ”"

The new drug targets, then destroys and removes amyloid plaques, toxic proteins that clump together and build up in the brain. Most aging brains have these buildups, but not nearly at the level linked to   Alzheimer's.   pharmaceutical company Biogen developed the drug, aducanumab, and funded the study. The results were published  Though researchers remain “cautiously optimistic” due to the small trial size, neurologist and study   Stephen Salloway told the magazine: “This is the best news we've had in 25 years of doing Alzheimer's research. ” One hundred   people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's participated in the study, and were given a monthly intravenous dose of either aducanumab or a placebo. Over the course of a year, 103 patients received varying doses of the drug. PET scans revealed that those who received the highest dose showed the largest degree of reduction. Scans of the 40 placebo patients were largely unchanged. “We are pretty certain of the fact that the antibody reduces the amyloid plaques and in some ways gets rid of the majority of it,” Alfred Sandrock, senior author of the paper,  Researchers said patients also exhibited slower rates of cognitive decline. The drug does have some side effects, including brain swelling. But Salloway, who's a professor of neurology and psychiatry at Brown University, told Time that regular brain scans could monitor swelling and prompt treatment when necessary. “Compared to other studies published in the past, the effect size of this drug is unprecedented,” Roger Nitsch, one of the paper's researchers and a professor at Zurich University,  If the results are confirmed, experts say aducanumab could be a major “ ” in the prevention of Alzheimer's.

Pandora is almost certainly headed into the arms of a larger entity. The shareholders of the Oakland, Calif. company have decided it's time the company    —   with Liberty   SiriusXM appearing to be first up at the table, sources told The Post. “The large shareholders are unified in wanting them to sell. They are going to be forced to start a process either now or in four months,” one shareholder told The Post. To be sure, not all of Pandora's board are on the same page  —   some are not convinced staying a   company isn't best, sources said. The internet radio giant   to decrease its reliance on its core   internet radio product, and those   operation should be given time to flourish, some board members believe, sources said. Pandora went public at $16 a share back in   and shareholders are currently holding out for an offer in the $18 to $20 range, one person told The Post. The stock closed at $13. 33 on Friday, after jumping 16. 1 percent on a report that Pandora was open to discussing a sales to SiriusXM. Despite the report, from CNBC, Sirius is yet to have any conversations at all with Pandora, sources said. That could change next week. Liberty Media Chief Executive Greg Maffei said in the summer Sirius XM was interested and had sent a letter of intent to Pandora at $15. Pandora founder and   had argued for more time to see if the new On Demand products will bear fruit  —   but shareholders and large hedge fund owners are singing from the same hymn sheet now. They want out of their investment. Centerview Partners and Morgan Stanley have been advising Pandora for months. There have been some    talks at Sirius about how an offer at $18. 50 would play out, one source familiar with the situation said. Others close to Sirius deny any new offer has been broached, meaning the early talks have been very informal. One argument against such a robust offer even being talked about lightly is that Pandora's business hasn't improved in the past quarter. In October, Pandora cut its forecast after it said active listeners fell slightly to 77. 9 million as of Sept. 30 from 78. 1 million a year earlier. The company also   to between $1. 35 billion and $1. 37 billion. Even so, Pandora is of strategic importance given its huge mobile ad business and experience in streaming media. Sirius might want Pandora to make its audience profile more youthful and take advantage of its demographic ad targeting. Shareholders want to see if other interested parties will step forward. Facebook, for instance, has long been looking for an entrance into the music business  —   and Google has eyed the venture before, a source tells The Post. Disney may also be interested given that it eyed Twitter and has been feeling out the streaming media world of late."
92542,137586,Superb acting shines in ‘The Light Between Oceans',NY Post,Kyle Smith,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://nypost.com/2016/09/01/superb-acting-shines-in-the-light-between-oceans/,"After burying two prematurely born babies, a young married couple is riven by their mutual agony. Then a boat washes ashore with a dead man and a living baby girl. In the   drama “The Light Between Oceans,” the couple (Michael Fassbender, as a deeply scarred World War I veteran, and Alicia Vikander, as the local girl who agrees to live with him in a lighthouse on an otherwise deserted island) make a fateful decision to pretend the child is their own. Naturally they run into the child's mom (Rachel Weisz) when they return to the Australian mainland. Beautifully photographed and acted, with a somberly affecting tone, the film, by Derek Cianfrance, is nevertheless marred by severely contrived elements. Would a man being harassed by an angry mob flee via the slowest conceivable method  —   a rowboat? You might as well hitch a ride on the nearest tortoise. And why would he take a baby with him? Some   issues that develop later in the film are also hard to swallow. Still, as Tom and Isabel, Fassbender and Vikander make the film work, just. Each of the leads is hollowed and enervated by sorrow, with the unexpected baby providing them with renewed purpose, just as Tom's lighthouse, perched between the Indian and Pacific oceans, steers sailors away from the rocks. Fassbender plays Tom as wracked and emptied by his four years on the Western front, while Vikander, one of the most captivating actresses on Earth, sensitively renders Isabel's devastation. Cianfrance, who became a   director on the basis of the exceptional films “Blue Valentine” and “The Place Beyond the Pines,” has taken a   backward here. Though he invariably paints a pretty picture, he isn't delving as deeply into his characters as before. That creates opportunities for the actors to tell the story with their faces, but Cianfrance, who also wrote the script based on M. L. Stedman's novel, doesn't meaningfully explore Tom's survivor's guilt, and occasionally the dialogue strays into hokey territory: “You still have a light inside you” is a typical line of Isabel's. Previously Cianfrance never strayed to the wrong side of the line between soulful and soapy. In this film he sometimes does."

At just 12 years old, Devan Merck was diagnosed with a rare condition called   ̈  syndrome, a congenital disorder that affects the reproductive tract. In Merck's case, she was born without a vaginal canal, cervix and a malformed uterus. Merck, now 23, underwent a hysterectomy at 13 years old, and later had reconstructive surgery, using tissue grafts to create a “ ” vagina. “They had to basically make a vaginal opening for me so I can have intercourse,” Merck, of Fort Benning, told Barcoft Media. “I had a thick layer of skin that covered my vaginal opening that they had to cut open and then they took skin from my bottom and placed it inside of me. ” Merck added: “I am no different  —   instead of having a fully functioning vagina, I have a   vagina. ” Growing up, dating was always a challenge, and she endured years of merciless bullying. “Kids would call me a ‘boy' and a ‘freak' and boyfriends would disappear when they realized I wouldn't have sex,” she said. Even the boyfriend with whom she lost her virginity was cruel. He would “call me names” and “remind me about my surgeries and how different I was  —   it hurt me,” she said. She eventually found love and has been married for five years  —   and is planning a family. Her condition, which affects 1 in 5, 000 women, prevents her from carrying her own kids in her womb. So she and hubby Trent, 28, plan to seek help from a surrogate mom, since Merck's ovaries can produce eggs. “It would be everything to be a mother. It would mean everything in the world,” said Merck, adding that a “really good friend” has offered to be her surrogate.  to raise $20, 000 for the IVF treatment and surrogacy process. “This is not something cheap. Since our insurance does not cover much of the expenses we will be having to pay most of this out of our pocket,” the donation page reads. “I strongly believe that with the help of our loving family and friends   …     we can one day have a baby of our own. Thank you's will never be enough, and we will forever be grateful to everyone who supports us during this time to reach our goal. ”"

Credit Politico for the investigation that exposed Bill's exploitation of a loosely written law to fund the very staff and office stock “now at the center of email and    scandals dogging Clinton's presidential campaign. ” As is typical with the Clintons, none of it is illegal  —   just unseemly. Yet it's also, as Politico's Kenneth Vogel put it, “fresh evidence of how the Clintons blurred the line” between everything they touched  —   the foundation, Hillary's State Department, Bill's business dealings, their political needs . . .

It was grateful to be rescued and immediately jumped into the arms of ESU workers reaching down to grab it.

Just this week, the number of breweries in this country surpassed 5, 000 for the first time, up 1, 000 in the past year and light years ahead of the 50 in operation in the   according to the Brewers Association. Fueling some of this growth is the capital flowing in from foreign breweries, including giant conglomerates like   InBev, which bought nine US breweries over the past couple of years and even smaller operations like Agrial, a French organization that bought Seattle Cider Company and Two Beers Brewing in September. “The craft beer industry has gone global and these overseas breweries see the US as the most developed and best market for it,” said Benj Steinman, president of trade publication Beer Marketer's Insight. “Their own markets are frequently declining and they have the resources to invest,” Steinman said. “There are a lot of them sniffing around here. ” The US craft beer industry has generated 50 investments over the past two years, according to Beer Marketer's Insight, including Heineken taking a 50 percent stake in    last year, and Japan's Kirin Holdings   this year. When   BrewDog opens a $30 million,    brewery in Columbus, Ohio, early next year it will become the first major overseas brewery to open its own facility here. “If they are successful, we'll see more like it,” said Bart Watson, an economist at the Brewers Association. “I'm sure there are other foreign brewers who are watching BrewDog. ” BrewDog, known for its Punk IPA, is hiring 130 Ohioans, and is on track to start brewing in February. It's already made a splash here before its first cans begin rattling on a conveyor belt. Two months ago it successfully lobbied the Ohio legislature to eliminate a law that limits the alcoholic strength of beer to 12 percent. “As a company we have a history of changing laws we don't like,” boasted BrewDog,   James Watt.

The Scottish brewery has plans to add brew pubs in the US, and has launched a $50 million   campaign. It's raised $3 million thus far. It also has distribution deals to ship its beers to six states, including NY and New Jersey. BrewDog was available in the US for several years until 2015, when it pulled out of the market because, according to Watt, it became too cost prohibitive to ship its suds here.  “It was also almost at the end of its shelf life by the time it arrived in the US,” Watt said. “Now we'll have much fresher beer to offer. ”"

She's 12 feet tall, with big chompers and a strapping body fashioned from 420 leather handbags in pink, tan, orange and black. Coach's ferociously cute dinosaur mascot, Rexy, stands ready to roar on the ground floor. “We wanted to make people smile,” the label's executive creative director Stuart Vevers tells Alexa. “Coach is about a certain ease and playfulness that I think feels right for today. ” Welcome to Coach's fanciful flagship, its biggest store in the world and the culmination of the brand's   celebrations. The milestone birthday was celebrated with a series of introductions, starting in June with   a   collection of Mickey Mouse designs on Coach togs and bags. Then in September, a new women's scent,   hit stores, with actress Chloë Grace Moretz as its face. A month later, the company unveiled “” by Joel Dinerstein, a   visual history of the label packed with archival photos and iconic ads. Debbie Harry of Blondie, the band Vevers cranks in the showroom, penned the introduction.  These launches cap the “reset” that the Yorkshire,   designer undertook when he joined the company in 2013. One of the first moves for Vevers, a bag specialist with a background at traditional European labels like Bottega Veneta, Loewe and Mulberry, was to update the   . He set about capturing a “unique and authentic American spirit,” with hip but practical pieces like this season's emblem varsity jackets, shearling coats and a Rexy cashmere sweater. The men's and women's “Coach 1941” collections, which are shown at NY Fashion Week, are each given a floor at the   new store. As for the bags,   old Vevers has conjugated the category every which way: Shoppers can select from new, bespoke, vintage, customized vintage, and updated archival items known as “Coach Icons. ” For the latter, Vevers selected four hero pieces  —   the Saddle Bag; the Dinky compact, convertible purse; the Rainger backpack; and the Duffle  —   and reimagined them in vibrant colors and surface treatments, like tea rose and patchwork. There's also a    Rogue bag area, part of Coach's personalization push. “Today, people want something that feels individual to them,” explains Vevers. Shoppers can choose among nine points of customization, from the color and type of leather to the hardware metal. More than one million variations are possible. In a nod to its heritage, Coach installed a leather workshop on the second floor. A   craftsman with 30 years of experience will do repairs and monogram hangtags with initials or one of 100 symbols. “We wanted the store to be warm and friendly and experiential,” says Vevers. “It's not about a fantasy   lifestyle,” he added. “It should be grounded in reality. To me, that feels modern."

Lilly Klapper, of North Texas, was hunting for whitetail with her dad and brother at the time and had been practicing her shooting for the past two years in preparation for this day. Her father, Cory Klapper, is an avid hunter and decided to get the memorable moment on film. On Tuesday, he posted the   footage from the Nov. 28 hunt on Facebook  —   and before he knew it, his daughter was an overnight internet sensation. As of 2:30 p. m. Friday, the video had been watched at least 2, 530, 000 times. “We have a passion for the outdoors, and it was primarily intended to be for family and friends,”  . “But now  …    I hope that it inspires other parents to get their children into the outdoors. ” In the video, Lilly can be seen focusing hard on her target  —   using an   rifle “chambered in 300 blackout” bullets, according to her dad. “Shoot the big one in the middle if you can,” he says, as the youngster takes aim and gets ready to fire. After two minutes of intense waiting, Lilly pulls the trigger. “You got it, baby! You got it!” her father cheers. As the excitement sinks in, Lilly opens her mouth wide and gasps  —   revealing her two missing front teeth and a big, bright smile. The reaction quickly went viral, sparking a slew of positive feedback from people in the hunting community  —   and even several critics of the sport. “This is amazing!! That's a dad teaching some life skills right there!” wrote one Facebook user. “SUCH A GREAT DAD! !!! I have never hunted and hate seeing the animals in Africa hunted and all that but this is so awesome what you did with your daughter,” another added. “You can see how proud she is of herself! !! She is so focused and patient!! GO DAD! !!!” Greg Stephens wrote: “We have become a nation of powder puffs. Thank God for Dads like you. Am teaching my grandson to shoot. Kids need this, as it teaches responsible behavior. ” While the comments have been mainly positive, Lily's dad was fully prepared for backlash from animal lovers.         “I respect and understand that this video may not be for everyone,” he wrote in the video's description. “If you think that you might be offended by this video that has my daughter shooting a deer with a modern hunting rifle, please keep scrolling. ” The   duo have been shooting guns together since she was five and have posted other videos online before in the past on a Facebook page titled, “Lilly Pad's Outdoors. ” In one clip, she can be seen blasting a   shotgun at a field target for her first time ever. “Love this. Fantastic,” a user wrote in the comments section. “Great to see kids loving something other than a computer. ”"
94177,139571,The best wireless headphones to block out the world,NY Post,Michael Gowan,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://nypost.com/2016/09/01/free-yourself-with-these-wireless-headphones/,"Rumors that   have caused panic in the streets  —   or at least a lot of   by those attached to their wired headphones. But even if Apple keeps the jack, you may want to quit it and go wireless. Bluetooth headphones don't need a wired connection to play sound from your phone or tablet. The lack of a cord frees you up: You're not tethered to a device, so you can get up and move around. You don't even need to be within reach of your audio source, thanks to the controls that many headphones have on the earcup or remote. Wireless headphones come with some tradeoffs, though: When you're buying wireless headphones  —   especially earbuds  —   the fit is key. Try to buy from a place where you can return if you and your new ‘phones aren't an ideal match. There's no doubt the future of headphones is wireless, and there are now plenty of wireless headphones to choose from. Bose, the maker of the best wired   headphones, now also makes the best wireless ones. Released earlier this year, the   which sells for $349. 99 (as of Aug. 31) has everything you're looking for in wireless,   headphones  —   they're light and comfortable, have 20 hours of battery life, feature controls on the earcup, and function as a headset for taking calls  —   and offer    noise cancellation. If you prefer earbuds, Bose is expected to release its   wireless   model in September 2016. Even with a budget south of $100, you can still go wireless without sacrificing sound quality thanks to popular company Skullcandy. If you crave the bigger sound you get from an   headphone, you'll get nice boom for your buck with the   which goes for $87. 99 (as of Aug. 31). In addition to driving bass, it has 12 hours of battery life, doubles as a headset, and feels very comfortable on your head. Similarly,   selling for $39. 99 (as of Aug. 31) delivers impressive bass for an earbud. The Ink'd Wireless opts for the collar design  —   putting the Bluetooth receiver and battery in a   collar that drapes around your neck. This design helps keep the weight out of the earbuds. Big   headphones generally sound better than earbuds, especially when it comes to detailed bass. But those cans take up a lot of room in your bag. Here's a solution that meets both needs without much compromise: The   which goes for $148. 70 (as of Aug. 31) packs a punch when it comes to sound quality, but folds up to easily tuck away. With 30 hours of battery life, you also don't need to worry about recharging very often. Everybody hears a little differently  —   which is why an app that personalizes the sound the way you like it is a great advantage.   which sells for $299. 99 (as of Aug. 31) is   headphones that work with its free My JBL Headphones app, which can calibrate the headphones' sound to how they fit your ears. You can also manage the level of noise cancellation if you want to allow some ambient sounds in. Sometimes controlling the fit of an earbud is as important as tweaking the sound.   going for $169. 99 (as of Aug. 31) come with an array of tips  —   including memory foam and    —   in various sizes to better fit your ear canal, as well as fins to help keep them from falling out. Its MySound app lets you create a custom EQ setting that's saved to the earbuds. Wireless headphones and exercise are a perfect match. No more yanking the earpiece from your ear when you catch a wire while swinging a kettle bell. But you need headphones that can handle the sweat.   $149. 99 (as of Aug. 31) is sweatproof and uses an open design to allow ambient noise in  —   important for safety when you're biking or running. If you plan to get your headphones really wet  —   like swim with them  —   Plantronics $130 BackBeat Fit are waterproof for up to 30 minutes in 1 meter of water. If you're just not an earbud kind of person,   selling for $119 (as of Aug. 31) is an   design that comes with washable headband and ear cushion so you won't have to worry about lingering odors after a sweaty workout. So don't sweat the wireless future. There's a wireless headphone to match your needs  —   and in many cases, the features improve on their wired counterparts. If you find that you really can't part with your old headphones, don't worry too much  —   you can be sure there will be adapters that retrofit the new headphone   devices."
94260,139673,Here's why your yoga studio is crawling with dudes,NY Post,Christine Burroni,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://nypost.com/2016/09/01/heres-why-your-yoga-studio-is-crawling-with-dudes/,"If you've noticed more dudes in your local yoga studio, you're not imagining things. Since 2012, the number of men   their way to tranquility has spiked from 6 million to 10 million, according to  And all these   brogis know regular practice has a benefit beyond flexibility: It's a great way to pick up chicks. “Guys that are into yoga tend to be introspective,” said NY City yoga instructor Todd Rengel. “In broad strokes, that's appealing to the type of woman who's looking for a man who isn't stagnant,” he said, explaining that men who practice yoga “want to know more about themselves and how they tick, versus your stereotypical frat boy who's just into drinking and relatively shallow things. ” Rengel, 50, has been practicing yoga for more than 10 years and says his practice granted him benefits that he doesn't think he would have found working out at a typical gym. “It started very much on a physical level and then I found that I was thinking more clearly and I was calmer and that was really intriguing,” he told The Post. Rengel is now engaged to his   girlfriend of several years. Outside the studio, long after the mats have been rolled up and tucked away, brogis claim they have seen social benefits. “I think it's totally a ” said Joseph Alpern, 31, of what women think of the fact that he heads to yoga several times a week, after randomly enrolling in a college yoga class years ago. “It indicates that you're interested in a healthy lifestyle and you're interested in being fit. ” And whether you're a     type or you start every day with a sun salutation, a man who hits the mat knows how to connect with women, according to  “Their capacity for emotional intimacy goes up,” she said of male yogis. “Women sense that, even if they don't know that that's what they're attracted to. They might be attracted to the job or the looks, but what they're really attracted to is the man's capacity to pay attention to her   …     in a way that makes them feel good,” she said. Alpern, who is a musician, practices mostly hot yoga and never hides his hobby when dating. “I put it out there because I do want the person I'm dating to be a   person with similar values to myself,” he said. “If they do yoga, great, and if not, then hopefully they do other things that make them healthy. ” Alpern also mentioned he's never met a woman who lost interest upon hearing of his dedication to yoga. “It's hard to see how that would be the case,” he said. Yoga “helps with the way that I carry myself and that's a huge thing that girls look [at because] it shows confidence,” Alpert said. Which apparently comes as no shocker, as a yogi's “confidence is what is attractive to women,” said Chrisler, who said women on the relationship hunt value “confidence way over washboard abs. ”   A post shared by Modo Yoga NYC (@modoyoganyc) on  That's not to say there aren't some   brogis out there. Just look at the array of classes available, from a traditional practice, to sweaty yoga in a   room, or classes set to   music. “If you think about the more athletic forms of yoga that have come up in the past couple of years, they're almost like sports conditioning,” said Natalia Petrzela, assistant professor of history at The New School and  . “Yoga has become more associated with fitness and stress relief, so doing yoga is not at odds with the notions of masculinity in the way that it did when it was primarily a spiritual practice. ” Though today's classes are packed mostly with   women, Petrzela noted that the ancient Indian practice of yoga actually excluded women, and only in the   century did yoga become a “  phenomenon” and largely female endeavor. Today, given the accessibility of yoga  and the rise of corporate fitness, allowing Wall Street men to perfect their tree pose after work, the thought of men doing yoga has become mainstream. Now, “yoga is associated with being strong and athletic as opposed to being spiritual and flexible, I think that that's helped a lot,” Petrzela said. Still, Petrzela, a fitness instructor herself, can see why some men would be hesitant to trade their dumbbells for a yoga mat. “If you think about the way that we define a ‘yoga body' in our culture, you think of a thin, flexible woman   …     and none of that is associated with being masculine,” she said. “But I think that our culture at large is really embracing the ideas about holistic   and a greater appreciation of yoga. ” Despite stereotypes and assumed ideal conventions, curiosity during a Buddhist philosophy class in college got instructor Brian Nygard interested in the practice. He wanted to try meditating. However, considering himself a “gym guy” at the time, with goals to gain muscle and bulk up, Nygard, 31, first felt frustrated and “overwhelmed” by the practice, mainly because he wasn't flexible. He didn't fall for yoga until what he considers his turning point: He took a class in a larger setting where he felt “more anonymous,” less   and more able to concentrate on his own goals and body.   A post shared by Brian Nygard (@noticeyourself) on  Nygard has now been teaching various types of yoga classes in NY for seven years. He says yoga has had a positive effect on his relationships. And when asked if women are generally into men who do yoga, Nygard, who typically dates women who do yoga, said with a chuckle, “I think it's an attractive quality. ” Furthermore, “I think that yoga helps me to see the humanity in people,” he said. And even though some yoga classes are targeted to athletes and their masculine ideals, Nygard also embraces the feminine characteristics of yoga, which he says encourage habits and traits that can improve relationships. “I think when people hear about someone who teaches yoga, they say, ‘Oh, this person is conscious and aware and probably would make a good partner. '” And if you're a   who refuses to try a class with a romantic partner? That may well be a   in the age of  . “If you're really resistant to trying it, that means you don't have a lot of flexibility” mentally, emotionally and undoubtedly physically, explained Chrisler, “and that won't work for being with a woman. ”"

94343,139776,Carl Icahn's kid ready to make a move at dad's firm,NY Post,Josh Kosman,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://nypost.com/2016/09/01/carl-icahns-kid-ready-to-make-a-move-at-dads-firm/,"Carl Icahn may hand over some control to get his financially successful offspring to stick closer to home. The billionaire investor's son, Brett Icahn, is angling for management responsibilities in order to stay on at his father's publicly traded firm, The Post has learned. In addition to overseeing a new pool of money, Brett, 37, wants some say at Icahn Enterprises before his    father is ready to retire. “Carl will be around another 20 years,” said Russell Glass, who was president of Icahn Associates before leaving to form RDG Capital Management. Brett and investment partner David Schechter, who manage the firm's Sargon portfolio, are advising the firm while they work to finalize the terms of a new deal, sources said. Their latest agreement expired on July 31. The partners are poised to get a huge payday come September, when each will collect a windfall of more than $250 million, thanks to lucrative investments in Apple and Netflix, among others. Icahn gave the partners $3 billion to manage in 2012, and agreed to give them an amount equal to 7. 5 percent of the profits over a 4 percent “hurdle” rate of return. The two have more than doubled the Sargon portfolio's value  —   to roughly $7 billion as of Dec. 31, 2015. Brett stood to reap $256 million as of that date, according to the firm's regulatory filings. Ditto for Schechter. Although the elder Icahn and his son declined to comment, they are making progress toward a new deal. “Brett and Carl are continuing to look at ideas and are also negotiating,” a source said. Neither is in a rush to invest, feeling the stock market is overheated. “Current market valuations do not provide an opportune time to embark on large new investments,” Brett and Schechter said in an August statement. The partners mulled starting their own hedge fund a couple of years ago but dropped the idea. As it stands, Brett has no stake in Icahn Enterprises, sources said. Neither Brett nor Schechter has a seat on the firm's   board. The president and chief executive of Icahn Enterprises, Keith Cozza, is 37 years old  —   the same age as Brett. Brett is older than his father was when the elder Icahn started his hedge fund. The     investor formed Icahn & Co. in 1968. RDG's Glass, who worked in an office next to Brett, believes the younger Icahn is ready for the top job. “He's probably got 30 years of work experience condensed in 15 years,” Glass said. “There was more scrutiny on him [than] anyone else at the firm. ” Brett is described by several people who have worked with him as more introverted than his    father. “They [Brett and Schechter] sit and read   all day long,” said a source."

The latest suspect centers on musician and     artist Robert ‘3D' Del Naja. “After looking at his movements over more than a decade, I believe Banksy may actually be a group of artists including Robert Del Naja, who is a graffiti artist and also part of [the] band Massive Attack,” Scottish journalist Craig Williams, wrote Thursday in  . Williams forged a link between Banksy and Del Naja, 51, by plotting at least six occasions where the international locations of Massive Attack concerts and appearances of artist's distinctive stencilled murals have coincided over the past 12 years. These overlaps included murals that appeared during Massive Attack concert tours in San Francisco, Boston and Toronto in 2010, and during Banksy's   residency in NY in 2013. Del Naja may be leading a small “street team” of artists who follow Massive Attack tours and leave behind a valuable trail of   work, Williams said. Del Naja has previously denied he is Banksy, though he has claimed to be the artist's pal, telling the   in a 2010 interview that he had stopped doing graffiti, “but Banksy coerced me to start up again. ” Conversely, the muralist has also denied being Del Naja, the   noted on Thursday. “When I was about 10 years old a kid called 3D was painting the streets hard,” claimed Banksy, who has said he does his own installations and disguises himself when in public. Del Naja isn't the first to be “outed” as Banksy. In 2008, the Mail put forward the name of another British street artist, Robin Gunningham, 42."

94804,140362,Inside the hospital room where TNT's Craig Sager bravely battles cancer,NY Post,Associated Press,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://nypost.com/2016/09/01/tnts-craig-sager-continues-to-battle-cancer-with-another-bone-marrow-transplant/,"HOUSTON  —   The chemotherapy has diminished Craig Sager's   chestnut hair to a few unruly strands, and on this day of hope, a simple green   and blue shorts adorn the man known by millions for his ostentatious wardrobe and easy rapport with the NBA's elite. He methodically extended a long, skinny arm to an IV pole holding the stem cells he is counting on to save his life. There was silence as he cradled the tube, watching the crimson liquid drip, drip, drip in a perfect cadence into the cannula feeding it into his   body. TNT's most beloved basketball broadcaster received a rare third bone marrow transplant on Wednesday as an aggressive form of leukemia continues to take its toll. The    Sager has battled acute myeloid leukemia since 2014, and announced in March that he was no longer in remission. Sager knows the odds are against him. Yet he is unfazed. “I like to gamble,” he told the Associated Press. “I like to bet on horses, I like to bet on dogs, I like to bet on a lot of things. I've bet on a lot of things with a lot higher odds than this. ” Two other times Sager has received a bone marrow transplant with stem cells, and in both instances it put him into remission for several months. His son, Craig Sager II, was the donor then. This time, the anonymous    donor was considered a perfect match. Sager has been hospitalized for a month and has another   stay ahead. He hasn't thought a lot about the random man whose bone marrow could change everything for him. But when he learned of his age, he expressed a possibly only   concern. “My only thing was I was afraid that when he signed up to be the donor, he may have been in some drunk fraternity house, trying to impress his date,” Sager said with a smile. “And they call him up the next day and say: ‘Want to come down to the hospital?' and he's like: ‘What? '” His fears turned out to be unfounded. “He came through,” Sager said. It is the latest of close to 100 procedures Sager has endured in his   fight and it was performed at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Sager began the transplant at about 11:30 a. m. Central time and it wasn't complete until more than 10 hours later. Dr. Muzaffar Qazilbash, Sager's stem cell transplantation physician, researched thousands of such transplants at MD Anderson over the last 15 years to illustrate just how uncommon Sager's procedure was. “It's less than 1 percent of the total number of transplants,” Qazilbash said. “It's very rare to have three transplants. ” Sager, who has worked for TNT for more than three decades, calls himself coachable and said he's open to trying anything doctors believe might help. “I've had every chemo in the alphabet, most of them more than once,” he said. “Some of them that aren't even in the alphabet, they're just numbers  —   clinical trials. But I bet if you added all those up, it would have to be like   or  . I've had 23 bone marrow aspirations. Having one isn't fun and I've had 23. So that's been tough. ” Despite the rigors of treatment and how they can ravage his body, he's never thought about giving up. In fact, he gets angry when he meets other patients who say they've grown weary of fighting. “Man, life is too beautiful, too wonderful, there's just too many things,” he said. “It's not just you. It's your family and kids and all. Fight. Fight until the end. Fight as hard as you can. ” With his radiant smile and   persona, it takes time to peel back the layers of positivity and catch a glimpse of how hard that fight can be. “His attitude is (that) nobody wants to hear it,” said Stacy Sager, his wife,   caregiver and No. 1 fan. “And so it makes you reflect on yourself and the things that you say when you're complaining about little things in life and trivial things and it just puts things in perspective. ” But there are times, often as night creeps into early morning, when it all becomes too much. No medication can help. ‘Fight. Fight until the end. Fight as hard as you can.' “I've never had any of those days where I've actually said ‘Why me,' or ‘I can't do it,'” he said. “But I'll have some dark nights where I'll be here by myself and maybe getting some medicine that's making me jump around like a rabbit. And I'm in pain and I've got chills and I've got fever and I've got everything mixed into one and I'm throwing up and have diarrhea   …     and I'll just say: ‘Stacy, I need you. I need you.' “And she'll come to me and just hold me and it just makes it better,” he said. A few days before his transplant, Stacy came down with a bad cold and doctors sent her home, fearful she'd transmit her illness to her husband. Hall of Famer and TNT colleague Charles Barkley heard she couldn't be there for a couple of days and hopped on a plane from Phoenix. The problem was that Sir Charles had hip replacement surgery less than a month ago and wasn't cleared to travel. He said his doctor was livid when he learned Barkley had defied orders and flown halfway across the country. Barkley informed the doctor that it was an emergency  —   though it was hard to know who was there for whom. “Craig Sager is one of the most interesting people I've ever met,” Barkley said. “We go to see Sager to cheer him up and by the time you leave you're like, ‘Is anything wrong with him?' He has the most positive attitude   …     when you go to try and cheer him up, his attitude is so upbeat he cheers you up. ” Sager has found inspiration in a little girl who lost her fight with cancer before her ninth birthday. He befriended Lacey Holsworth and her family while working on a story about her illness and remained friends with her parents after she died in April 2014. Holsworth had cheered on the Michigan State basketball team and  . Last weekend, her parents visited Sager in his Houston hospital room. They left him with a more tangible reminder of her bravery. “They brought me little Lacey's boots that she used to always wear to games and a picture of her wearing them,” Sager said, clutching the   cheetah footwear accessorized with laces made from silk ribbons. “That little girl was so amazing. Fought for all of those years, was always positive, always cheerful, always brought other people's spirits up. So if I'm laying here feeling bad, I just think about Lacey and it puts everything in perspective. ” Sager is also bolstered by his drive to be back on the sideline for the NBA season. He doesn't expect to have recovered from Wednesday's transplant in time for the season opener on Oct. 25, but aims to return by early November for more of the gentle sparring with the likes of Spurs coach Gregg Popovich . It would be a victory not just for him, but for all the people his fight has inspired. “It means that you're surviving and you're winning,” he said. “That you're knocking down obstacles and clearing hurdles that are put in front of you and you're doing them with flying colors. ” On Wednesday, five colorful balloons were tied to one side of his hospital bed. Several had birthday greetings and two said: “Happy birthday, it's your big day. ” Festive, yes. But Sager was born in June. “When you get stem cells, they say it's your new birthday,” Stacy explained. “So this is his fourth birthday. ” Sager tried to downplay the pageantry surrounding the event, saying it wasn't “a big deal. ” That earned a sweet, yet stern, admonishment from his beloved wife. “It is a big deal,” she said. “It's giving you life. ”"
94906,140496,Neil Walker's shutdown misery: ‘Was hurting team and myself',NY Post,Zach Braziller,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://nypost.com/2016/09/01/neil-walkers-shutdown-misery-was-hurting-team-and-myself/,"Another one bites the dust. After receiving second and third opinions on the herniated disc in his lower back that was hitting a nerve, Neil Walker announced Thursday he will be undergoing   surgery, joining David Wright, Lucas Duda, Matt Harvey, Zack Wheeler and Juan Lagares as Mets likely out for the season. Walker said the operation, known as microdiscectomy surgery, will include a   recovery time and has a high success rate. Manager Terry Collins    —   hours after general manager Sandy Alderson told reporters Walker could play through the injury and described it as “routine”  —   and the team's second baseman made it official a day later before the Mets went for a   sweep over the Marlins at Citi Field. Walker last played in a game on Saturday. If he had continued to play through the pain, Walker estimated he would've been at 60 percent, and the condition was worsening, not improving. “It was a very difficult decision,” said Walker, a free    who expressed hope of a possible return with the Mets. “There were a lot of factors that involved: the way the team was playing, the way I felt. I did everything I could. Twice, I played a couple of days, tried to give myself a couple days off, and the biggest issue was it was hitting a nerve. I still can't feel my toe, and that's caused kind of a chain reaction. “The more I tried to push through it, the more I realized I was hurting the team and myself. I had to be honest with what was going on here. I want nothing more than to be on the field. It's very disappointing in my eyes. ” Walker was told by doctors playing through the injury would only make it worse. He had numbness in his toe, and after playing in a few games, his legs would get weak. He felt fine swinging, but sliding, diving and running would weaken his body. Walker was undecided about the surgery before meeting Wednesday with the third doctor. That doctor felt strongly he should go ahead with the surgery, instead of putting his future at risk, and further hurting his back and legs. Mets doctors hadn't been as forceful about him getting the procedure done immediately. The initial plan was for him to play through the injury, as Alderson and Collins had said in recent days after a recent MRI exam showed the herniated disc. But after meeting with all three doctors, it was clear to him surgery was the right move. “At this time of year, with the possibility of breaking up double plays, diving for balls, trying to score from first, I just didn't think it was the right thing for me to do, to do to the team,” Walker said. “Playing one day, taking a couple of days off, or playing two days in a row, taking a day off, as much as I was willing to do that, after taking to the doctors, they felt like that was not a good thing to do. ” Walker experienced a similar issue in 2012 with the Pirates, but didn't go through with surgery then, getting an epidural shot instead. He was 25 at the time, not 30, as he is now, another reason to go ahead with the procedure. Walker was enjoying a strong first season with the Mets after coming over from the Pirates in exchange for Jon Niese in an offseason trade. Replacing Daniel Murphy at second base, Walker was hitting . 282 with a   . 476 slugging percentage and . 823 OPS. He hit 23 home runs, equaling a career high. Collins plans to use Kelly Johnson and Wilmer Flores at second base in place of Walker. “‘Walk' gave it his best effort, but unfortunately we got to move on,” Collins said. “With [Asdrubal Cabrera] back, with [Yoenis Cespedes] back, and certainly with the way [Wilmer Flores] is swinging, there's a feeling of, ‘Hey, we're OK.' But that's still a big piece missing. ”"
95281,140981,Student found slain in forest after mysterious disappearance,NY Post,Chris Perez,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://nypost.com/2016/12/02/student-found-slain-in-forest-after-mysterious-disappearance/,"Mystery surrounds the death of New Jersey college student who went missing just before Thanksgiving and was found dead at a state forest reserve  —   the victim of a homicide, cops said Friday. Search crews stumbled upon the body of    Sarah Butler at around 11:30 a. m. Thursday while trekking through the Eagle Rock Reservation in West Orange,  . The Essex County Prosecutor's Office ruled her death a homicide on Friday afternoon and told the outlet that it appeared her remains had been placed there by someone. “We are trying to piece the timeline together,” explained Chief Assistant Prosecutor Thomas Fennelly. “It is an extremely active investigation. ” Authorities have not revealed where they found Bryant's body in the   park and have yet to give her exact cause of death. “The mystery behind her disappearance and ultimate loss of life is unsettling,” said Jo Ann Short, president and CEO of the Montclair YMCA, where Butler worked as a lifeguard. “As a    college student, she had a bright and promising future ahead of her,” Short added. “Her family is grieving and we pray for answers so their healing can begin. ” Butler  —   a freshman at New Jersey City University in Jersey City who loved to dance and performed at the Apollo Theater on numerous occasions  —   was first reported missing on Nov. 23 after she failed to meet up with her family for a scheduled trip to Jamaica. The Montclair native's father, Victor Butler, has been out searching for his daughter ever since and was devastated to learn the news about her death. “I couldn't help her,”  . “That is the most hardest part  …    The family's having a hard time. We all are  …    It was senseless. ” A makeshift memorial was placed outside Butler's home on Friday just hours after cops revealed that she had been killed. “Not my Sarah, not my Sarah,” cried her mom, LaVern Butler, who was one of several at the scene. “Whoever did this is a dog,” she said,  . Butler  —   who lived on NJCU's campus and was studying media arts  —   was last seen on Nov. 22 driving her mother's 2007 Dodge Caravan, which was later found abandoned in Orange. What she was doing at the time is still unclear. “She had so much more to give, and now we can only hope that her killers are caught,” said Pluchet Alexander, a family friend. “This is a family's worst nightmare. She never did anything to hurt anyone and was loved by all. ” The Essex County Crime Stoppers Program has announced a reward of up to $10, 000 for any information leading to an arrest. “She was the sweetest thing I ever had, and she's gone now,” Butler's aunt, Phyllis Carpenter, told CBS. “Somebody took her away. ”"
95430,141176,How ‘La La Land' conjures old Hollywood musicals,NY Post,Michael Riedel,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://nypost.com/2016/12/02/how-la-la-land-conjures-old-hollywood-musicals/,"Nothing will bring a smile to your face faster this holiday season than the opening number of “La La Land,” Damien Chazelle's new movie that's poised to reinvigorate the Hollywood musical. The scene is a traffic jam on a Los Angeles freeway. It's sunny  —   it's always sunny in LA  —   but the drivers are hermetically sealed off from the weather, from each other, in their   cars. Horns honk, windows roll down, music drifts from radios. And then, for no apparent reason, a woman jumps out of her car, throws her arms open to the sun and starts singing. Soon everybody's singing and dancing around and atop their cars. An exasperating traffic jam turns into a big, bold, bright showstopper. The scene evokes Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse, “Seven Brides for Seven Brothers” and “An American in Paris. ” Throw in nods to “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg” and “The Young Girls of La Rochefort”  —   director Jacque Demy and composer Michel Legrand's charming French movie musicals of the 1960s  —   and you have cinematic confection. Chazelle had those performers and movies in mind when he made “La La Land. ” “I fell in love with   musicals  —   with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Gene Kelly  —   when I was 18,” says Chazelle, who grew up in Princeton, NJ. “I loved the creative bravado. When someone starts singing, those movies just jump to a whole new resister, unapologetically. Not everything has to be grounded in psychological reality. If you're happy enough, you break into song. That was par for the course in old Hollywood, and I wanted to get back to that simplicity. ” Caught in the traffic jam are the movie's stars, Emma Stone, as a struggling actress, and Ryan Gosling, a     musician. He honks at her. She blows him off. But in true old Hollywood fashion, their paths cross again. On their first date, when love comes in and takes them for a spin, they dance among the stars at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. “La La Land” received rave reviews at the Venice Film Festival last summer and is generating strong Oscar buzz. But the movie almost didn't take flight. When Chazelle brought the idea to Hollywood executives, he was greeted with skepticism. “Chicago” won six Oscars, including Best Picture in 2003, but it was based on a hit Broadway musical that everybody knew. “La La Land,” an original film musical, would be expensive, with no guarantee that contemporary audiences wouldn't smirk at singing and dancing from the Golden Age of Hollywood. “I think they crunched the numbers in the backroom and saw that it just didn't add up,” says Chazelle. “It may be phony math, but there's a certain kind of logic to it. ” Chazelle switched gears and made a small, dramatic movie instead  —   “Whiplash,” which won three Oscars, including Best Supporting Actor for J. K. Simmons. (Simmons has a charming cameo in “La La Land. ”) Chazelle now had clout with the studios, and could start peddling “La La Land” again. He found the perfect producer in Marc Platt, a musical theater fan who, when he wasn't producing hit movies such as “Legally Blonde,” brought a little show to Broadway in 2003 called “Wicked. ” It has grossed, to date, more than $4 billion worldwide. “I loved ‘Whiplash,' so it's probably true that had Damien come to me with the phone book, I would have produced it,” says Platt. “But I believe in film musicals  —   ‘The Sound of Music' tells its story beautifully  —   and when Damien walked me through his script shot by shot, it was clear he was lovingly looking back a the old musicals but also stretching the form. ” For all its spontaneous singing and dancing, “La La Land” has a naturalistic look. Los Angeles, the movie's   backdrop, is both romantic and gritty. In one scene, a group of girls in brightly colored dresses are singing and dancing down their way down an LA street. There's a palm tree, but look closely at the street and you'll see oil slicks and cracks in the pavement. “I have a   relationship with Los Angeles,” says Chazelle. “It seduces me at one moment and then utterly crushes me and disgusts me at another. That alone is fodder for a musical. ” “Astaire and Rogers. Hepburn and Tracy. They had chemistry. Emma and Ryan have it, too. It's   and wonderful. ” The characters portrayed by Stone and Gosling experience the seduction and disappointment of the LA dream factory. Their love affair takes some unexpected twists, but their attraction for each other is always palpable. “There is a quality to Emma and Ryan that is   Hollywood,” says Platt. “Astaire and Rogers. Hepburn and Tracy. They had chemistry. Emma and Ryan have it, too. It's   and wonderful. ” Stone and Gosling had some experience singing and dancing. She did a nice turn as Sally Bowles in the Broadway revival of “Cabaret” a couple of years ago, while he got his start on the Disney Channel's reboot of “The Mickey Mouse Club” in the early '90s. But it's fair to say neither was the   incarnation of Charisse and Kelly. So they went to work in the rehearsal studio with “La La Land” choreographer Mandy Moore. “I worked with them separately at first, because I didn't want it to be the blind leading the blind,” Moore says. “I wanted to build up their confidence. You don't want someone else in the room giggling at you because you can't pick it up right away. ” As it turned out, Stone was a quick study, nailing the routines and then, later, adding nuance. Gosling was slower, but, says Moore, added his personal style right away. When she put them together, they clicked. When you see them   a Rodgers and Hart line is sure to cross your mind: “Isn't it romantic?” If “La La Land” is a hit, is a Broadway stage version a possibility? “Certainly, when I'm involved,” says Platt. Chazelle says, “I would be scared out of my mind. I've never done theater. I have no idea what I would do with it onstage. But never rule anything out. ”"
95537,141322,What the Trump administration could mean for digital privacy,NY Post,Associated Press,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://nypost.com/2016/12/02/what-the-trump-administration-could-mean-for-digital-privacy/,"Under a Trump, cable and phone companies could gain new power to influence what you do and what you watch online  —   not to mention how much privacy you have while you're at it. Many experts say that Republicans who generally oppose regulation are likely to take charge at the Federal Communications Commission, the government's primary telecom regulator. That alone could mean the end of rules designed to protect privacy and individual choice on the internet. Those rules were enacted over the past several years under the Obama administration. Under Trump, “the FCC will be a lot more focused on getting government out of the way,” said Berin Szoka, president of TechFreedom, a think tank that opposes much regulation. Phone and cable companies routinely protest that regulation leads them to invest less in their networks, harming their ability to deliver better service. Deregulation raises concerns for consumer advocates  —   not just in terms of rolling back rules, but also potentially allowing more huge mergers, which several analysts expect despite Trump's campaign swipes at big media. Under the coming administration, a laxer FCC could result in even higher cable and internet bills, worse customer service and fewer choices, says Harold Feld, senior vice president at public interest group Public Knowledge. Of course, it's difficult to know exactly what to expect, given Trump's aversion to policy specifics and frequent reversals during the campaign. Representatives for Trump's transition team didn't reply to requests for comment. One possible first target: rules that aim to protect individual choice and innovation on the internet. Suppose that firing up Netflix or YouTube led only to delays and stuttering playback that still counted against the limited data in your broadband plan  —   a sharp contrast to the speedy video app offered by your phone or cable company, which incurs no data costs. That's one scenario the   FCC sought to ward off with “net neutrality” regulation that requires internet providers to treat all data traffic equally on their networks, as the internet has historically worked. Without net neutrality, your access to many popular services might be degraded by your local cable or phone company. Startups could have trouble delivering new video or   services. Companies that provide internet service could find it easier to push their own options instead. The   rules are popular, so they're not likely to completely disappear under Trump. But the FCC might well be more restrained in enforcing them. Internet providers could use subtle tactics and    maneuvers to change people's behavior and make more money, suggested Matt Wood, policy director at the public interest group Free Press. Consumers might eventually find that they have fewer services to choose from online, or that using them is more difficult or expensive. If the Trump FCC whacks away at existing regulations, cable and phone companies are going to find it a lot easier to mine your browsing habits and other information for data they can use to target ads at you. Verizon, for example, is eager to build a   business to compete with Google and Facebook. But recent privacy rules force them to ask customers for permission before using their data. Those companies have made no secret of their dislike for this requirement. The FCC's effort to “open up” the cable box in ways designed to give you more options for hooking up TVs and streaming gadgets to cable service is likely dead. Its effort to subsidize internet for   people may face budget cuts, although cable companies do offer separate cheap internet options for   people. During the campaign, Trump spoke out several times against media giants, in particular when he said he'd reject AT&T's $85. 4 billion acquisition of Time Warner and that he might look at breaking up Comcast and NBCUniversal. But some analysts think that with Republicans in charge of agencies like the FCC and the Department of Justice, mergers are more likely to sail through. The new administration might make it easier for AT&T to buy Time Warner and reserve some of the conglomerate's TV programs and films for its own subscribers, said MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett. Analysts had expected regulators to impose consumer protection conditions on the merger if it's approved. But under the Trump administration, AT&T might remain free to hold back new episodes of “Game of Thrones” for a few weeks  —   or maybe even everything on HBO  —   unless you're an AT&T cellphone or home internet customer, he said. If so, Verizon or Charter might go shopping for their own entertainment conglomerates to compete for customers. That could create a world in which the TV you watch would be heavily influenced by the company that supplies your internet service. But Trump's FCC could also do something unexpected. Public Knowledge's Feld, for instance, worries that the administration could harness the FCC's existing tools to police media companies and limit freedom of the press. For instance, the FCC could threaten to condition renewal of broadcast licenses on how news programs cover the administration, said Floyd Abrams, a longtime First Amendment lawyer. The agency could threaten to go after a company like Comcast, which owns NBC and MSNBC, for a net neutrality violation on its cable side to try to pressure coverage. “The FCC has so much authority over policies which have an enormous and direct impact financially” on the industry, Abrams said. “Even an informal nudge in one direction or another, informal pressure of one sort or another, can have major impact. ” Of course, such action could bring Trump into conflict with the Republicans Congress, which generally favors limits on FCC power. But there's no way to know how that would play out at this stage."

The gunman approached his    victim around 11:05 p. m. accusing the man of selling him fake narcotics the day before, police sources said. An argument ensued, and at one point, the assailant asked for oral sex from the dealer's girlfriend, who was also in the area, as retribution for the phony drugs, sources said. The suspect then pulled out a gun and smashed the man in the head before firing a single shot at the ground. The victim  —   who had an outstanding arrest warrant  —   was hit by a piece of concrete when the bullet hit the pavement and suffered a minor leg injury, police sources said. Cops still haven't found the gunman, who fled east through the park, according to police sources. The victim has an outstanding warrant and could get locked up, law enforcement sources added. Earlier this month, The Post reported that Washington Square Park has become a hangout for aggressive vagrants, who freely sell drugs on benches in the park's northwest corner. One Village resident said he even saw a junkie shooting drugs into his neck within plain view of two cops sitting in a cruiser about 15 feet away. The Post report  . Watchdog group NYC Park Advocates also found that violent crime in green spaces across the five boroughs have gone up 23 percent in the   period ending March 31 compared to the same stretch a year earlier."

The    Brown did not give any specific reason why he was stepping down, but said he would leave his post on Oct. 22, according to a Dallas police bulletin published Thursday afternoon. He said he plans to address the media about his retirement on Sept. 8. Brown became a beloved national figure when he gave an impassioned speech following   asking Black Lives Matters cop protesters to join his police force. “We want to be Superman  —   we are the last to ask for help. If anything could be done, it needs to be done by our public, which includes the protesters,” Brown said. “I probably wouldn't protest or complain. I would get involved and do something about it. Don't be a part of the problem. We're hiring. Get off that protest line and put an application in, and we'll put you in your neighborhood, and we will help you resolve some of the problems you're protesting about,” Brown added. In the early morning hours of July 7, Brown made the bold decision to use a police robot packed with C4 explosive to kill mass murderer Micah Xavier Johnson, 25, who was keeping police at bay in a downtown Dallas municipal garage. It was the first time in the nation's history that a police department used that tactic to neutralize a threat. Johnson, a former Army reservist in the Afghan war, had fatally shot five Dallas police officers and wounded seven other cops and two civilians during his rampage. In earlier negotiations with cops to get him to surrender, Johnson said he wanted to kill white people because he was angry about two racially charged   shooting deaths. Brown's tenure at the top of the Dallas Police Department was not without controversy. Earlier this year, several Dallas police unions demanded his resignation because of a spike in murders. In June 2010, Brown's son, who struggled with mental illness, was   about seven weeks after Brown took the reins as chief."

The report Friday by the Labor Department  —   marking the 74th straight month of job creation  —   was generally in line with Wall Street expectations and left most economists convinced the Federal Reserve will lift rates on Dec. 14 after its   meeting. “This probably seals the deal for a rate hike by the Fed,” said NY University economics professor Joe Foudy. “The election is over; the job market is solid, if unspectacular; and there really is no more reason to wait. ” The Fed raised its interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade. The unemployment rate's decline from 4. 9 percent was aided by 226, 000 people who dropped out of the workforce. Their exit helped lower the labor force participation rate to 62. 7 percent  —   the lowest since June  —   while the ratio of employment to the entire population held steady at 59. 7 percent. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said in the past that the US economy needs to create just under 100, 000 jobs a month to keep up with growth in the   population. Economists attributed much of the drop in the labor force participation rate to retiring baby boomers, who began leaving their jobs in 2008. Average hourly earnings fell by 3 cents in November, to $25. 89  —   but that was after an increase of 11 cents in October. “The economy never moves in a straight line, and the slightly slower pace of wage growth is one of the detractors within the November employment report,” said Mark Hamrick, Bankrate. com's senior economic analyst. Despite last month's decline, average hourly earnings are up 2. 5 per cent for the year  —   a trajectory economists expect to resume should the labor market continue to strengthen. To that end,   Trump announced the formation of the President's Strategic and Policy Forum. Deeper into the November jobs report, Labor reported:"

At bottom, the cause of the   is simple: Trump believes in immigration laws and the country's elite really doesn't. That the opinion elite recoiled in horror shows how out of sympathy it is with borders and what it takes to enforce them. It was understandable that everyone felt whiplash. Trump had primed people to expect something different, both with his public wobbliness over the last week and his quick strike into Mexico, where he lucked out in a successful meeting with that country's hapless president, Enrique Peña Nieto, and sounded newly statesmanlike notes about pursuing the good of the “hemisphere. ” And Trump didn't do himself any favors by giving the Arizona speech in a rally setting. He can no more resist playing to a crowd than a   comedian or a rock star. When he's in his shouty mode, Trump could read the phone book and make it sound like an outlandish screed. All that said, the policy portion of the speech was detailed and substantive, and took a   to the clichés and lazy thinking encrusting the immigration debate. Trump nailed a few theses to the door of his promised great, impenetrable border wall that are important and too often neglected: The opinion elite was never going to accept a Trump speech that didn't have the “right answer” on the 11 million illegals already here. By ruling out amnesty for now, Trump emphatically gave the wrong answer  —   although one that makes sense if we take our immigration laws seriously. An amnesty will act as a magnet for future illegal immigrants unless we have a comprehensive, functioning system of enforcement in place to dissuade them from coming. That's why enforcement has to come first. This was the soundest immigration speech ever delivered by a presidential nominee, and a total policy victory for restrictionists. There are two problems, though. One is that it's such a   agenda, it needs to be presented with a deft touch or it's going to repel not just Hispanics, but other swing voters. Instead of opting for the soft sell, Trump seemingly went out of his way to make his policy sound as audacious and threatening as possible. Two, if Trump loses, this agenda will be discredited and restrictionists will instantly be as embattled as ever, once again fighting a desperate   action against a political establishment and opinion elite that consider its priorities bizarre and hateful."

And, in details only just revealed about a   flight he took last year during the holidays, Huang is still rolling in perks. Again through   bonuses, he booked a   ticket on Singapore Airlines from Los Angeles to Sydney  —   with stopovers in Tokyo and Singapore  —   for $480. A good way of doing this?   he writes, which has a   bonus of 100, 000 points. “The retail cost of these flights booked separately would have [been] over $16, 000,”  . The flights came with serious luxuries, especially the one from Singapore to Sydney. Not only did he munch on caviar, seared tuna, an   ribeye steak and a hazelnut crepe while sipping Krug champagne, he also got to sleep on a double bed in a private   cabin, which had a   television. So how else can you get the most out of your holiday travel? If you haven't racked up the level of   bonuses that Huang has, there are other ways to get cheap fares. He recommends  . The “search flexible dates” options on other sites can be basic, he says, and give a range of plus or minus three days. But this   option allows users to choose from a calendar of lowest fares, as well as specify a date range and different airports within driving distance. “Instead of a range of a few days, the search tool can look up every single flight combination for up to 30 days,” Huang tells The Post.  Huang says customers who book flights but then cancel them to get an account credit toward another airline flight that lasts a year. “A good trick is to . . . book a Southwest flight, and then continually ” he says. “If you find a better fare on another airline, simply cancel your Southwest ticket, and you'll have a year to use [the credit]. ” And if you're unsure of your plans, but want to book anyway, feel free. Here's the trick: Normally, you can cancel flights within a day of booking them. But if you book your travels at precisely 1 a. m. on a given date, you can actually finagle a   grace period for final  . That's because 24 hours after booking would be 1 a. m. the next day, but you'll actually have until midnight at the end of that day to cancel with no penalty. Perfect for those who are on the fence. “[It's] nice for those who are still unsure of their travel plans but want to ‘lock in' their fares,” Huang adds."
96782,143010,NYC's hottest holiday store openings,NY Post,"Timothy Mitchell, Anahita Moussavian, Alev Aktar and Lauren Joseph",2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://nypost.com/2016/12/02/nycs-hottest-holiday-store-openings/," The   fashion myth that NY City women could be classified as either uptown girls or downtown girls is now officially obsolete. Not convinced? Consider this: Last month, Acne Studios  —   pioneers of Scandinavian cool, purveyors of badass leather jackets  —   opened its new global flagship at   in the fabled heartland of ladies who lunch.   a block from the Met Breuer, the boutique marks the   brand's largest opening to date. Its spacious, arty interiors were conceived by British designer Max Lamb in collaboration with Acne creative director Jonny Johansson, who chose gold as the shop's signature color.  “For me, it was important to elevate the store design into something spectacular since the location demands it in a way,” Johansson said in a press release. “Therefore, I went for gold. Classic, but still in the universe of Acne Studios, it's like a local store on a global stage. ” Expect to find the label's bread and butter  —   shoes, bags, jeans and other    basics  —   situated among more directional offerings from the women's fall 2016 runway collection. Inspired by '80s punk rock, that lineup included PVC leotards, holographic mini dresses and oversize   coats the color of Sweetarts. If none of those strike your fancy, fret not: There are more than enough of those black leather jackets to go around.       While the   myth surrounding Adidas' meaning  —   “all day I dream about sports”  —   is pure fashion folklore, the brand's newest (and largest) store is the stuff sports fantasies are made of. Massive in scale, it spans 45, 000 square feet and occupies four stories on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 46th Street. The space is an homage to a place where team spirit bleeds strong: the   stadium filled with   nostalgia. “Locker rooms” serve as dressing rooms in disguise, while a track arena dubbed “the Turf” allows sneaker freaks to   the   footwear before purchasing.   seating, stadium lights and water fountains play up the throwback theme, while phone charging stations and massive   TVs airing whatever game is currently live bring the store up to 2016 speed. Trading up from your typical Gatorade fare, juices and snacks   with     are on offer to quench sports fans' thirst. Meanwhile, real time fitness consultations from EXOS trainers give shoppers the chance to break a   sweat while stocking up on products designed for soccer, football, basketball, running, tennis and more. Perks such as a concierge desk and   service pad out the experience. In honor of the store's splashy recent opening, Adidas is rolling out   apparel and footwear collections, including pieces from its collaboration with Rita Ora. Taking a cue from the street    aesthetic that's currently trending, this mashup of stars, bold   and mixed materials is the perfect blend of fashion and function.

The   duo behind Cuyana, which means “to love” in Quechua (a native South American dialect) manufacture their wares all over the world. Their oversized alpaca sweater, for instance, is knit in Peru, while the reversible   soft wool cashmere coat is stitched in Italy, and the canvas and leather Weekender bag is crafted in Turkey. Many of the line's newest entries, including the   silver shimmer leather crossbody pouch  —   a steal at $120  —   are made in the US.

The concept store, open through Dec. 23, is   of giftable and affordably priced Mongolian cashmere, Australian merino wool and   leather pieces  for men and women. Choose from instant urban classics, like the $100 Cashmere Crew in nine colors or the $265   wool Cocoon Coat, which looks as good with jeans as it does with a pencil skirt. The    leather goods range from wallets and pouches to the company's first casual crossbody bag, a foldover style in four colors.

The   store showcases a selection of the label's    bags created from Italian leathers, many featuring signature contrast interiors with matte patent coating. The new line of shoes  —   think sculptural pumps and backless,   slippers  —   will also be in the mix. Everything comes in feminine colors right out of a makeup line, from blush and peony to sea blue.  The rosy space is decorated with custom Mansur Gavriel flower arrangements, which, conveniently, are for sale. And if the sales associates look particularly hip, it's because they're wearing uniforms designed by the house's founders, Rachel Mansur and Floriana Gavriel, who have won two CFDA Awards in their four years in business, including this year's Accessory Designer of the Year honor.

Westwood, who has nearly a hundred stores worldwide, has thus far only opened two in the US  —   in Honolulu and Los Angeles. She opens the uptown    address at the same time as a Paris flagship, with both serving as the introduction to a new architectural store concept. Alongside her    director, Andreas Kronthaler, and the Italian architect Simona Franci, the designer has created a   space that captures both Vivienne Westwood the irreverent and Vivienne Westwood of the eponymous luxury label. Think glass cases holding a   emblazoned with “Revolution” across the chest steps away from a bridal and Gold Label eveningwear salon dedicated to fitting   gowns. The   waves, polka dots, and tartans Westwood has championed throughout her    career are everywhere, from the rugs to the clothing. And with neighbors like Ralph Lauren's   Polo Bar and the tony St. Regis hotel, foot traffic will surely be steady  —   although, perhaps, a little shocked by this Brit's controversial style. This was on full display on the fall 2016 runway, where some girls modeled the guys' clothes and vice versa. So what to buy at this latest import from across the pond? While a ruby clutch for her and a patterned derby shoe for him would surely charm most, Westwood has something up her sleeve for her NY  : a selection of original Worlds End collection pieces, usually available only in London. Unisex,   belts and cuffs, painted with the store's address, are also on offer  —   just in time for a   holiday."
96924,143203,Chef who invented General Tso's Chicken dies at 98,NY Post,Yaron Steinbuch,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://nypost.com/2016/12/02/chef-who-invented-general-tsos-chicken-dies-at-98/,"Chef Peng   who cooked up the recipe for General Tso's Chicken, a perennial favorite Chinese dish in the US, has died of pneumonia at age 98. The chef, who also founded the   chain Peng's Garden Hunan Restaurant, invented the sweet and slightly spicy,   staple that became a favorite in   Chinese eateries across the country. The dish  —   believed to be named after Tso   a Qing dynasty general  —   was introduced to the US by way of the Big Apple in the early 1970s as an example of Hunan cooking. Peng, a Chinese native, began training at the age of 13, and fled to Taiwan after the 1949 Communist revolution. He told the China Times that he created General Tso's in 1952, during a visit by US Seventh Fleet commander Admiral Arthur W. Radford. When he ran out of offerings after three days, he decided to chop up some chicken, fry it to a golden hue, and then add a sauce and seasoning to create a new dish,  . Radford was so impressed with the dish that he asked Peng what it was called. The   Peng blurted: “General Tso's Chicken. ” In 1973, Peng opened Peng's Restaurant on East 44th Street in Manhattan and soon attracted the attention of officials from the nearby UN headquarters. Among the devotees was StateSecretary Henry Kissinger. In 1977, The NY Times reviewed Peng's Restaurant. “General Tso's thicken was a   masterpiece, sizzling hot both in flavor and temperature,” Mimi Sheraton wrote about the dish. A 2014 documentary called “The Search for General Tso” explored the origins of the iconic dish, which was unknown in China. One woman in the piece commented about the   hybrid: “It doesn't look like chicken. It looks like frog. ”"

Joe McKnight hadn't worn a Jets uniform since the preseason three years ago, long enough  —   especially with this woebegone franchise  —   for much of the current roster to never have played with him. But it wasn't just the ​dozen or so ​players still around from McKnight's tenure who were taking his   in a Louisiana   incident Thursday hard. Even players too young to have known the former running back and kick returner could sense McKnight's passing had cast a pall over the entire practice facility. Even amid the Jets' woeful season, the locker room and halls at Woody Johnson's gleaming Florham Park complex usually have been a source of smiles and friendliness. Good times or bad, the Jets' camp never will be confused with a visit to Bill Belichick's Patriots, where you are required to check in at “Security Command” and made to wonder if this is what a trip to CIA headquarters must be like. But not Friday. It was as quiet as a funeral in the Jets' locker room, because that is what several of them no doubt will be having to attend  —   so needlessly, so pointlessly  —   in New Orleans in the coming days. “He was definitely one of the most popular guys in the locker room,” said safety Antonio Allen, who played alongside McKnight in 2012 and the 2013 preseason. “Everybody knew him and everybody liked him. My heart goes out to his family. I can't say much other than it's heartbreaking. He was so young. ” Several of McKnight's former Jets teammates were too shaken up to speak with the media Friday afternoon, releasing statements through the team's public relations department instead. One of them was cornerback Darrelle Revis, who recalled McKnight's    arrival as a   pick out of USC in 2010  —   McKnight was so out of shape he vomited on the field after his first practice and later admitted to an  's diet  —   and eventual emergence as an ace returner. “He came in his rookie year and it was a little rocky for him trying to learn the system,” Revis said in a statement. “And then his second year he took off as an explosive kick returner and he's won us numerous games. It was awesome to see him excel not only as a teammate but as a friend. “It's hard to come to grips with the reality that he is no longer with us. ” Center Nick Mangold, like Revis another veteran who played alongside McKnight all of his   seasons with the Jets, appeared stunned. “It's a tragedy,” Mangold said. “Joe was a great guy. It's very disappointing. I feel sad for him, his family, the guys that played with him. It's tough. ” The Jets will have a moment of silence for McKnight before Monday night's game against the Colts. There was also a streak of anger running through the locker room after reports that McKnight's confessed killer, a    white man named Ronald Gasser, had been quickly released without charges while the Jefferson Parish (La.) Sheriff's Office continued its investigation. Police later disputed reported details of the killing and indicated Gasser had been released initially because of the state's controversial “Stand Your Ground” law. Allen, who had tears in his eyes, spoke before the police news conference. But as a Florida native who went to South Carolina, Allen is familiar with the “Stand Your Ground” law and had an inkling that's what was behind Gasser's quick release  —   and Allen wasn't happy about it. “We've got a lot of work to do in this society with all these gray areas in the laws and this [“Stand Your Ground”] law, in particular,” Allen said. “We've got to fix it. ” Allen's voice trailed off, as if he realized fixing that law was too late to save his friend's life over something apparently so trivial. “He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, and now he's gone,” Allen said. “What a stupid tragedy. ”"
97725,144314,Cuomo has blacklist of foreign firms that support BDS,NY Post,Carl Campanile,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://nypost.com/2016/12/02/cuomo-has-blacklist-of-foreign-firms-that-support-bds/,"He's boycotting the boycotters! Gov Cuomo's administration has blackballed a dozen foreign companies for supporting the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel, The Post has learned. The Office of General Services compiled the list after Cuomo   barring NY State's government from investing public funds in any firms that back the campaign. None of the businesses are American, and state officials said Friday night that they did not believe any state agency has financial dealings with them. So it's basically a political gesture supporting Israel. “NY stands in solidarity with Israel today and always. This state will not stand for the politics of discrimination in any form, and we will continue to demonstrate our unwavering support for the people of Israel in the fight for freedom, liberty and democracy,” Cuomo when he signed the order. The order prevents state agencies from investing their funds with institutions including Dutch bank ASN, Danish bank Danske, KLP Kapitalforvaltning and Kommunal, as well as Triodos Bank and Betsah Invest SA, both in the Netherlands. The list also includes Cactus SA, a Luxembourg supermarket business, and Vitens, the largest drinking water company in the Netherlands. British companies including Freedom Call UK, a telecom and the   Group, a food retailer also made the list.   and civil libertarians claims Cuomo's action is  . “Whenever the government creates a blacklist based on political views, it raises serious First Amendment concerns, and this is no exception. We will be looking very closely at this executive order,” said Donna Lieberman, executive director of the NY Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU). Radhika Sainath, of the Palestine Legal and Cooperating Counsel, said, “State blacklists reminiscent of the McCarthy era have no place in a democracy. The Supreme Court has made this crystal clear: boycotts to effect political, social and economic change are protected by the First Amendment. Some of the firms are already banned in Florida and Illinois."
97786,144401,The 13 worst free-agent signings in MLB history,NY Post,"Dieter Kurtenbach, Fox Sports",2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://nypost.com/2016/12/02/the-13-worst-free-agent-signing-in-mlb-history/,"It's free agency  —   the money is flying around and everyone wants to land that big player who could help their team get over the hump next year. It's all so great in theory. But these 13 players are testaments to that theory backfiring in a big way. These are the cautionary tales of free agency  —   the 13 worst   signings in the history of baseball: The    stuff (arrested for patronizing a prostitute and a DUI) was as bad as the    performance, which is to say it was atrocious. Baseball's   best reliever was already on the downslope when Atlanta handed him big money in 1984. He blew 12 saves in his first year and only saved 3 in 16 games in 1986. He pitched in 38 games in 1988, but that was it for his career. He did, however, defer half the money in his contract at 13 percent interest. He's been making an estimated $1. 3 million a year off that since 1991. It'll run until 2021. The Braves united the Upton brothers in one of the   “wish we had a chance to do that over” moves in baseball history. After a season in Tampa Bay where Upton didn't even get on base at a . 300 clip, the Braves handed him big bucks to be their leadoff hitter. He played 267 games in the ATL and posted a . . . 314 slash line before being traded, at full cost, to San Diego (with a Craig Kimbrel kicker) where he found his stroke again. Vaughn left Boston, where he played in a park   for his lefty swing (he was a proto Big Papi) for the big payday. His two years in Anaheim did not live up to the size of his contract or his belt. A knee injury kept him off the field in 2001, and the Angels traded their oversized asset to the Mets for    starter Kevin Appier, who posted an ERA of 4. 48 in 51 starts for them. Hit . 313 in 2006 in the friendly confines of the Ballpark in Arlington, and the Angels, having been burned by Matthews' first year of hitting above . 275 and not understanding what regression to the mean meant, spent big bucks on a player that quickly became their fourth outfielder. Bay was so bad in his time in Flushing that the Mets and he agreed to end his contract a year early. The former Rookie of the Year and     played three years for the Mets, where he posted a slash line of . . . 369 and hit 26 homers  —   10 fewer than his   2009 output with the Red Sox. It's pretty bad when your new team signs your replacement a year later. (Andruw Jones was also a bust in LA). After an   year in Florida in 2004 (  3. 00 ERA) Pavano went to the Bronx and only started 26 games over three years, posting a 5. 00 ERA. Pavano clearly had a voodoo doll in his likeness  —   he injured his shoulder, elbow, hip, ribs and butt in his time in NY. Figgins had killed the Mariners as a member of the Angels in 2009, posting a . 395 OPP and making the   Game for the first time. The Mariners grabbed the utility man who finished in the top 25 of MVP voting four times in Anaheim, and he promptly imploded. A . 340 OBP in his first year in Seattle turned into . 241 in 2011. In three years with the Mariners, he had a slash line of . . . 283.  He was released after the 2012 season. Coming off an   year in San Francisco, the Dodgers paid big to steal the righty from their division rival. A shoulder injury limited him to 10 starts in two years  —   he posted a 6. 02 ERA in blue. Was excellent in 181 starts with the Dodgers, pitching against National League hitters and in Dodger Stadium. When he showed up at the bandbox in Arlington against American League hitters, things went south. Park had a 5. 79 ERA in 68 starts for the Rangers before being traded to San Diego in 2005. The Rockies needed pitching and Hampton was the best pitcher on the market following the 2000 season. The Rockies chose to ignore the fact that he had walked a combined 200 batters in his prior two seasons and presumed the   pitcher would thrive in Denver. They were wrong. He posted a 5. 75 ERA in 62 starts before the Rockies moved him to the Marlins, who traded him two days later to the Braves. He had one   year in Atlanta. No one feels good about putting Hamilton, who has a history of substance abuse and addiction, in this spot, but it's the worst deal of all time. Two years after winning AL MVP for the Rangers, the Angels signed Hamilton to that massive $25    deal at age 32, only to see his OPS drop 191 points in his first year in Anaheim. In 2015, Hamilton relapsed, and the Angels tried to get out of paying him via a suspension. An arbitrator ruled they could not suspend him, so they traded him back to the division rival Rangers for nothing, with Texas paying less than $6 million of his salary over three years. At the time of the trade, the Angels were on the hook for a reported $68 million."
97825,144451,Unemployment rate drops to 9-year low,NY Post,Associated Press,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://nypost.com/2016/12/02/unemployment-rate-drops-to-9-year-low/,"US employers added a solid 178, 000 jobs in November, reflecting the steady economy   Trump will inherit. The unemployment rate hit a   low of 4. 6 percent, though mainly because many people stopped looking for jobs and were no longer counted as unemployed. Friday's report from the Labor Department reflected a resilient job market that is helping drive the US economy. Job gains have averaged 180, 000 a month this year  —   more than enough to lower the unemployment rate over time. The pace of hiring keeps the Federal Reserve on track to raise   interest rates at its next meeting in less than two weeks. “This jobs report paves the way for Fed rate hikes,” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics. “It also tops off a recent run of continually positive economic data. ” Still, sluggish pay increases and a decline in the number of Americans either working or seeking work point to   challenges for the economy that Trump will face. Those same challenges bedeviled Obama and might have helped lead millions of voters to choose Trump over Clinton. Last month, average hourly pay slipped after a strong gain in October. Wages have risen only about 2. 5 percent over the past year  —   about a percentage point less than is typical in a healthy economy. The number of unemployed fell by 387, 000 to 7. 4 million, lowering the jobless rate from 4. 9 percent. But only about a third of that drop occurred because people found work. The rest reflected a decline in people looking for jobs. The government doesn't count people as unemployed unless they're actively looking for work. The drop in the number of people working or seeking work appeared to be concentrated among white men, a group that helped form the core of Trump's support. More positively, the number of   workers who would prefer   work dropped last month. That helped lower an alternative gauge of unemployment that includes involuntary   workers and discouraged   workers, to 9. 3 percent, the lowest since 2008. Still, that figure remains above   levels. Factories shed 4, 000 jobs in November, more than offsetting the roughly 800 jobs that heating and air conditioning manufacturer Carrier said it would keep in Indiana after Trump criticized the company for planning to move them to Mexico. Construction companies added 19, 000 jobs, and professional and business services, which includes   positions in accounting and engineering, gained 63, 000. Retailers cut 8, 300 jobs, an unexpected loss as the holiday shopping season gets under way. The decline suggests that retailers don't expect a huge rush of consumer traffic. But online and catalog retailers stepped up hiring, as more shopping migrates to the internet. Department stores and clothiers slashed jobs. Overall, fewer than 60 percent of adults have jobs  —   3 percentage points lower than when the Great Recession began in late 2007. In part, that trend reflects retirements by the nation's many baby boomers. But it also means hiring hasn't kept up with population growth. And seven years into the recovery, pay growth is still below healthy levels. Many of these trends  —   particularly the drop in the proportion of adults with jobs  —   emerged years before Obama took office. Trump's challenge will be to try to reverse them. He may get some help from the economy's upswing: As employers continue hiring amid low unemployment, they will likely be forced to offer higher pay. Thicker paychecks, in turn, may draw more people who aren't either working or seeking a job to begin looking again. And businesses may offer more hours to their   workers. There is evidence  —   such as last month's solid wage gain  —   that these trends have begun to take hold, though progress has been slow. Still, nearly every economic report since the election has pointed to accelerating growth  —   a key reason why the Fed is considered certain to raise   interest rates this month. Americans bought homes in October at the fastest pace in nearly a decade. Their willingness to make such a major purchase reflects growing optimism. In fact, according to the Conference Board, Americans are more confident in the economy than at any other point in the past nine years. They are spending more, too. Solid consumer spending helped propel growth to a 3. 2 percent annual rate in the   quarter, the best showing in two years. By one measure, nationwide home prices have fully recovered and are even slightly above the level they reached in 2006, before the housing bubble burst. That steady rise in home prices has boosted Americans' household wealth and helped lift their overall finances. And even as consumers are spending more, pay is rising enough to enable more savings: Americans saved 6 percent of their   income in October, up from 5. 7 percent in September."

The Hot Stove League will have to wait a little longer. Brian Cashman said Friday morning he had alerted a host of agents representing available players, as well as executives of other teams with whom he had engaged in trade talks, of his intention to shut down business until the Yankees had a better grasp of   and awaits ratification by the players and owners. “I said, ‘Listen, give me at least 24, 48 more hours to see what sort of information we can get from baseball,'” the Yankees general manager said in Stamford, Conn. between stints rappelling down the Landmark Building as part of the city's Heights & Lights holiday program. “So hopefully we'll be able to hit the ground running Monday at the latest, but it's in our best interest to know what we're dealing with, first and foremost. ” The Winter Meetings formally begin Monday in National Harbor, Md. The Yankees are looking for multiple relievers, with particular interest in   closer Aroldis Chapman, as well as a starting pitcher and designated hitter. It appears   thanks to favorable adjustments, but won't offer much relief on the luxury tax. “From the early returns, I think the decisions that we made in the summer [trading Chapman, Andrew Miller and Carlos Beltran, another candidate to return] are even that much more important based on what I'm reading [in the media],” Cashman said. “Speeding up the process and going with the youth movement is going to play an even more important part now, more than ever with what appears to be some of the restrictions in the marketplace that are occurring here. ” He expressed no concerns that a delay in acting would cost his team any players. Realistically, no major free agent the Yankees seriously want, particularly Chapman, will make a move without waiting for the Yankees' best and final offer. The Yankees never made an offer to Yoenis Cespedes, Cashman said, before  . “I had several conversations with [Cespedes' agent] Brodie Van Wagenen,” Cashman said. “He mapped out their expectations. Those expectations got met by the Mets. I think that they would have considered anybody that was willing to meet their expectations. Now, all things being equal, clearly NY was a place he wanted to stay. And I'm sure the Mets were a place he had comfort because that's where he's played and wanted to be. He never said the Mets were his first choice, but my sense was the Mets were his first choice. “All the tea leaves pointed to him wanting to be a Met, hoping to be a Met, but willing  —   because it's a business  —   to do whatever's in his best interest depending on the other offers out there.   …    He's a heck of a baseball player. Very talented and very impactful for that franchise. ” When Jacob Lindgren was taken by the Yankees in the second round of the 2014 draft (55th overall, but the Yankees' first pick) the   reliever from Mississippi State was touted as possibly being the first pitcher from that draft to reach the majors. He did that in 2015 when he worked seven big league innings before surgery to remove bone spurs from the elbow. This past season, Lindgren underwent Tommy John surgery in early August, and on Friday wasn't tendered a contract for the 2017 season. After making six relief appearances for   Tampa, in which he went   with a 2. 57 ERA, Lindgren was shut down. Since Tommy John surgery requires 12 to 16 months to recover from, it's likely Lindgren will miss the 2017 season. The move leaves the Yankees with 39 players on the   roster heading into the winter meetings and makes room if they want to take a player in the Rule 5 draft."
97953,144667,How to keep your tree from causing a raging inferno Christmas morning,NY Post,Associated Press,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://nypost.com/2016/12/02/how-to-keep-your-tree-from-causing-a-raging-inferno-christmas-morning/,"WORCESTER, Mass.  —   It only takes a minute for a crispy Christmas tree to touch off a raging inferno. Researchers who set up a mock living room complete with curtains and an armchair  —   and then hit “record” as a    engulfed the room in 63 seconds  —   hope their video will help people stay safe this holiday season. “This has only been one minute since time of ignition and we're seeing that the carpet has now ignited and that's an indication of what we call flashover, where the room has gone from local burning at the tree to complete room involvement,” said Raymond Ranellone, director of the Fire Protection Engineering laboratory at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. “So in your home, that'd be your entire living room on fire in just over one minute,” he said. Engineers at the Massachusetts university staged the live exercise on Tuesday as city firefighters stood by. They used a freshly harvested Christmas tree that was left unwatered for three weeks in the room, recreating conditions that often occur after people decorate their homes for the holidays. First, they touched the tree with a blowtorch. Instantly, the lower branches ignited. A few seconds later, flames were shooting out of the arms of the chair and thick smoke was billowing. It wasn't long before the fake room was engulfed in a very real fireball. “This truly was alarming, truly surprising for us to see us going from an ignition all the way to a flashover in this compartment in just 63 seconds,” said Ranellone. “And when we start to think about what 63 seconds means  —   that's how much time we need to get out of the house, to alert the fire department and get the fire department to our houses.   seconds is just not a lot of time. ” Christmas trees were to blame for an average of 210 house fires annually between 2009 and 2013, according to the   from the National Fire Protection Association. Those fires killed seven people, injured 19 others and caused $17. 5 million in property damage, the organization says. Experts say the risks can be minimized by following several simple steps. “The best way to prevent a Christmas tree fire is to water it well every day, place it well away from heat sources, and dispose of it soon after the holiday,” said Massachusetts Fire Marshal Peter Ostroskey. Since about   of tree fires are blamed on electrical problems, he said it's always a good idea to turn off lights on the tree when leaving the house or going to bed."

102936,151262,Things to Come review – Isabelle Huppert in exquisite agony,Guardian,Peter Bradshaw,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/01/things-to-come-review-isabelle-huppert-in-exquisite-agony,"This film's English title might summon up science fiction, but the French original  —   L'Avenir, or The Future  —   conveys something a bit plainer. It is austerely flashed up on screen over the image of a grave: the tomb of Chateaubriand in Brittany, where a vacationing philosophy teacher has come with her husband and children, on something between a pilgrimage and a   day trip. She is Nathalie (Isabelle Huppert) a   prof de philo who in the course of the film is to lose her husband, her mother, her publishing career and her relationship with a favoured pupil. Her situation seems dramatically singular. But maybe it is just a variation on the future that awaits everyone: increasing aloneness approaching death, an erosion of worldly status, and even the basics of domestic intimacy. Mia   is an excellent   and this is a really good film: stylish, elegant, measured, held together with a thread of exquisitely reticent sadness. The movie's composure, like that of its lead character, is challenged but not damaged by the terrible shocks. But I should confess it didn't bring me to quite the levels of euphoria that others have experienced, or that I have experienced with other   movies such as Eden or Father of My Children, which seemed to me have a more radically uninhibited passion. Huppert is giving a performance that isn't a notable departure, glazed by her habitual   hauteur. But she is unimpeachably cast and what a brilliant and commanding presence she always is. Nathalie is a former communist who has been deradicalised and disillusioned by reading Solzhenitsyn at the film's beginning she is shown angrily walking through a picket line that students have set up to protest against the Sarkozy government's delaying of state retirement age. Nathalie is annoyed at these young people's presumption: but   also shows that she is personally horrified at the idea of retirement itself at any age. Her work and its prestige means an awful lot to her. And it is under threat. A philosophy textbook she was written, for years a standard teaching aid for French schools, is going out of print, and the commercial viability of a new edition is in question. She endures a horribly uncomfortable meeting at her publisher where new executives timidly suggest a revamping and   of the cover with bright colours  —   like advertising MMs, as Nathalie furiously puts it. Her husband, Heinz (André Marcon) admits to her that he is seeing someone else and moves out of their Paris flat and at first Nathalie is more devastated by the thought of all the work that she has put in, cultivating the garden at her husband's family home in Brittany (where they saw the Chateaubriand tomb). Flowers are now, therefore, fraught with painful, complex meanings. She is furious at the bouquet Heinz sheepishly leaves for her in the apartment jamming them into the kitchen bin, she hurts her thumb. Later, she is reserved and thoughtful when students bring another, very similar bunch for her. Her mother, Yvette (Edith Scob) is entirely impossible: a former model, and now a cantankerous drama queen and depressive who is always making suicide attempts and calling the fire brigade  —   bizarrely  —   for maximum disruptive effect. Yet we can see how some of her beauty and imperious attitude has been bequeathed to Nathalie, who is also to inherit her mother's cat Pandora, which threatens merely to play havoc with her allergies. A classic Huppertian ironic distancing and  . Nathalie herself cries rarely in the film: once, when she has to leave her mother at a care home with its “smell of death” again when she is on a bus, and her tears are converted into an ironic gulp of laughter on glimpsing her husband on the street with his new girlfriend. But most importantly, she cries when, after the split, she comes to an idyllic weekend at a commune where her favourite pupil lives. Fabien (Roman Kolinka) is now a brilliant published author, and considerably to the left of his old teacher, a fact that causes unease. She can't be one of the young people, now: Fabien was the son she never had  —   and perhaps a tiny part of her has wondered, vainly, if their relationship couldn't or shouldn't now become more complicated. Nathalie confesses to Fabien that she feels free for the first time: free of the things that provided happiness and comfort. In late middle age she must start again. Or perhaps it is that Nathalie sees more clearly than most how we must all start again to some degree, doing without more and more as our lives pass the halfway or   mark. In some ways, her Nathalie is a cousin to Eva, the   daughter she played in Michael Haneke's Amour. This is a rigorously intelligent and desperately sad movie."
103143,151508,The best US TV of 2016 … that you probably didn't watch,Guardian,Benjamin Lee,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/02/best-tv-2016-you-probably-didnt-watch,"Crudely positioned as “the black Entourage” upon release, this sharp LeBron   show shares as many similarities with the Hollybro show as it does differences. There's an initial setup which offers a similar culture clash: a young basketball player and his family move to Atlanta with more wealth and opportunities than they're used to and struggle to adjust. But while the   HBO comedy relished hedonism, and little else, Survivor's Remorse has far more to say. It weaves in issues of race, class, sexuality and gender without ever seeming   niftily gliding between topics with ease, as comfortable covering the underrepresentation of   black women in fashion as it is debating the etiquette of whether to send a thank you note for a thank you note. The cast, including  's Teyonah Parris, are all adept comic actors and they relish a set of scripts filled with   quips and Curb Your   farce. It's a curiously, frustratingly   show, on its third season yet still averaging fewer than 1m viewers a week yet it deserves its spot next to Atlanta, Insecure and Luke Cage as a rare multilayered new show where black characters dominate while white characters, well, who cares? BL, If you don't already subscribe to Hulu, you should, just for this show (Casual is a fine bonus). Its greatness is not just manifest in its crackling dialogue and expertly madcap pacing, but also in the mere fact that it represents one of the last examples of the great snarky sitcoms of the 1990s. Increasingly, the modern American sitcom has leaned into one of two categories: the populist charm offensives typified by shows like Fresh Off the Boat or The Great Indoors and navel gazers in the mold of Louie, You're the Worst, Master of None, Transparent, and Girls that mine pathos as often as they go for the laugh. This is a stark contrast to the misanthropic, neurotic tradition of Seinfeld and the Larry Sanders Show. Those shows neither sought to explain the human condition nor simply gloss over the darker aspects of it in favor of a laugh track. Difficult People's protagonists, Julie (creator and writer Julie Klausner) and Billy (Billy on the Street's Billy Eichner) make few apologies for their   behavior or their lust for show business glory. While the narrative occasionally dives into earnestness, it tends to only be in service of reinforcing the bond between them rather than to teach them some dunderheaded moral lesson. It plays with form and structure in the way Seinfeld did in its finest episodes, and Klausner and Eichner have some of the best   comic chemistry on TV. This is as sharp and clever as pure TV comedy gets, even if it's behind a $9. 99 a month paywall. DS, Since the election, we've been confronted with a country that feels more divided than ever, but if there's one thing that always unites Americans, it's football  —   and TV shows about football. Since Friday Night Lights isn't coming back any time soon, Last Chance U  —   a   Netflix series documents one year at “America's most ‘off the grid' football team”  —   is exactly what you need to watch right now.  Inspired by Drew Jubera's 2014 GQ piece of the same name, Last Chance U spends a year with the highly successful but little known East Mississippi Community College Lions. At EMCC, young American football stars who have been kicked off their Division I teams (for things like drinking, bad behavior and failing grades) spend a year trying to get their NFL dreams back on track. Set in Scooba, Mississippi (population 732) the show takes viewers into the nation's heartland.  Despite all the talent at EMCC, everyone from the coach to the players has demons they must confront if they're going to succeed: there's a fanatical, almost dangerous coach, Buddy Stephens, the overly emotionally invested academic adviser, Brittany Wagner, and the frustratingly inconsistent but lovable players. You can bet who's gonna make it at the start of the show if you want, but the magic of Last Chance U is that you can't help but root for every one of them. RS, Halt and Catch Fire is TV's ultimate underdog. An   tech drama from AMC, its purpose when launched in 2014 was no less than to fill Mad Men's immaculately shined shoes. It didn't manage the impossible. And it has never been a ratings smash. But it's testimony to the faith the network have in this series that they are to give its handful of adoring fans a fourth and final run.  In season one, we met   suit Joe MacMillan. A Steve Jobs type who manipulates his own Steve Wozniak, computer genius Gordon, his equally brilliant engineer wife, Donna, and a    punk programmer called Cameron into creating the perfect PC. The second season proved the depth of this sleeper hit, focusing on the two women as they set up their gaming company, Mutiny. By the third season, Halt and Catch Fire's momentum was unstoppable.  Every episode is gripping,   and prophetic. (Joe is trying to invest in the internet years before any billionaire benefactor can even fathom it.) These are finely drawn characters to truly love, and the fallout for them is vast. There are secret HIV tests, shotgun weddings and suicides. But, this being the 80s, there are also Super Mario Bros marathons and people dancing to the Pixies. What could be better than that? KA, Perhaps unsurprisingly, this comedy starring Zach Galifianakis as a woefully   rodeo clown (Chip Baskets) didn't get that much love when it premiered in early 2016. Who needed another show about an angry   clown man going back home to wrestle with some unsettled scores, a horrible   and equally dickish relatives? No one, really. But creators Louis CK, Galifianakis and Portlandia's Jonathan Krisel manage to harness the things they're best known for: daftness,    and baiting the pretentious, and somehow make this show about a clown work. The segments in the French clown school he studies in are bizarre and offbeat, his only pal Martha (Martha Kelly) is brilliantly downbeat and there's a storyline with a Juggalo that is as weird as you'd expect. Even if you just watch it for Louie Anderson (who plays Chip's mother and won an Emmy for his performance) it'll be worth it. Oh, and there's a second season coming in 2017, which may or may not reference that ridiculous killer clown trend from the summer. LB, In the horribly pally world of late night, Eric Andre stands out as a gloriously anarchic aberration. His series The Eric Andre Show, which recently completed its fourth season on Adult Swim, might seem to share the same structure as Fallon, Kimmel et al, but it's less interested in maintaining chatshow norms and more interested in smashing them to pieces. His live band is made up of dishevelled   weirdos, his     segments are likely to get him arrested, his   games are less   than   and you get the sense that he'd be more likely to surround Trump with rats than ruffle his hair. Sure, at times it's painfully puerile  —   Andre eating his own vomit and causing guest Lauren Conrad to flee the set, is a good recent example  —   but at its best, the show has a sense of danger and playfulness that nothing else on TV (with perhaps the noble exception of Billy On The Street) comes close to matching. Plus, anyone willing to risk life and limb to take the piss out of Alex Jones is surely worth cherishing. GM, A new millennial mystery full of unlikable people, TBS's Search Party starts off like many other shows but ends somewhere rather different. It stars Alia Shawkat (best known as Maeby from Arrested Development) as the lead character Dory. Dory is the hipster loser trope made famous in Girls, High Maintenance and Master of None.   malcontent, anxious about her lack of life direction and seeking purpose. She finds it when Chantal Witherbottom, a girl she vaguely knew in college, goes missing. Dory turns Nancy Drew, convinced she spotted Chantal and can solve her disappearance. A whole film noir element emerges, which is what really makes the show worth watching.  Search Party feels very 2016, with texts appearing onscreen, people meeting on Bumble and zingers about current Twitter hashtags. Its creator Sarah Violet Bliss said recent hits like Serial and The Jinx inspired the whodunnit aspect. It's not the best television show you'll see all year. But it's charming, the finale is suitably   and you can watch the pilot on YouTube to get a taster. AJ"
103217,151598,Arrival review: heartfelt alien-contact movie communicates spectacular ideas,Guardian,Peter Bradshaw,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/01/arrival-review-amy-adams-denis-villeneuve-alien-contact,"Denis Villeneuve's   contact drama is dreamy, freaky, audacious. It skirts the edge of absurdity, as anything like this must, but manages to keep clear, and it includes a big flourish in the manner of early films by M Night Shyamalan, which adroitly finesses the narrative issue of what exactly to do with a movie about aliens showing up on Earth. I have been agnostic about this kind of movie recently, after the overwrought disappointments of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar and Jeff Nichols's Midnight Special. But Villeneuve's Arrival is both heartfelt and very entertaining. As is now expected with this kind of film, the protagonist is a flustered, bewildered civilian with special expertise, brusquely pressed into service by the military, which has got the spacecraft surrounded in the short term. Amy Adams is Dr Louise Banks, a professor of comparative linguistics with nothing and no one in her life but her work. But as it happens, Dr Banks was once seconded as a military adviser to translate a video of insurgents speaking Farsi. So when a dozen giant spaceships land in 12 different locations on Earth (including Devon  —   sadly there no scenes there) each looking like a bisected rugby ball standing on end, a bunch of army guys led by Col Weber (Forest Whitaker) show up on Louise's doorstep, demanding she come with them to help translate what the aliens are saying. Why, you ask, did they not approach Noam Chomsky, with his understanding of “deep structure” in language? Perhaps Prof Chomsky did not care to help America's   complex. At any rate, Louise's liaison is the flirtatious Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) a military scientist who, in a stereotypical and fallacious way, equates his masculinity with science and affects to despise what he sees as the softer discipline of linguistics. Michael Stuhlbarg plays Halpern, the glowering CIA chief. But unbeknown to them, there is a secret tragedy in Louise's life: a lost child, dead of cancer in her late teens. Her attempts to communicate with the aliens cause painful but illuminating echoes in her mind. If a lion could speak, said Wittgenstein, we would not understand him. Does the same go for aliens? Spielberg solved this issue elegantly in Close Encounters of the Third Kind by making the form of communication a   musical phrase, ending questioningly on the dominant. Villeneuve's solution is more literal. The aliens have a code which  —   a little preposterously  —   Louise finds herself more or less able to crack, with the crowdsourced expertise of the other 11   teams around the globe. But it is her human intuition, vulnerability and spontaneity that finally enable her to reach out to the visitors.  Inevitably, these “contact” moments are where the film's real impact and atmosphere have to be. And Villeneuve doesn't disappoint in sequences of eerie and claustrophobic strangeness  —   though I concede the film is most effective before the physical form of the aliens is revealed. There are also touches of comedy: Ian and Louise decide, for convenience's sake, to nickname two aliens Abbott and Costello  —   maybe in homage to the linguistic misunderstanding in the duo's famous routine about a baseball team's positions. By coolly switching focus to political intrigue and betrayal within the human ranks, Villeneuve keeps a grip on his story and creates ballast for its departure into the realms of the visionary and supernatural. And he also prepares us for the film's sense that language itself, freed of our usual sense of its linear form, might be more important than anyone thought. (I wonder if Villeneuve has seen the 2010 documentary Into Eternity, by Danish   Michael Madsen, about attempts to devise a new universal language to label underground repositories of nuclear waste  —   labels whose warnings have to be understood by future humans whose language has evolved away from what we know now.) Arrival is a big, risky, showy movie which jumps up on its   highwire and disdains a net. And yes, there are moments of silliness when it wobbles a little, but it provides you with spectacle and fervent romance."
103326,151739,Mother of Briton accused of trying to shoot Trump makes appeal to Obama,Guardian,Simon Hattenstone,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/02/michael-sandford-briton-accused-trying-to-shoot-donald-trump-barack-obama,"The mother of an autistic man who allegedly wanted to shoot Trump at a campaign rally before the US election has appealed to Obama to allow her son to serve his sentence in Britain. Michael Sandford, 20, will be sentenced later this month after pleading guilty to lesser charges of being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and disrupting government business.  The Briton attempted to grab a pistol from a police officer at a Trump campaign event in Las Vegas four months before the election, and said he had wanted to kill the then presidential candidate. Sandford had hoped to receive the minimum sentence of   months in prison, because he has no previous convictions, and to be allowed to serve it in England. But his mother has said he is terrified that pressure from the   may result in a more severe sentence that has to be served in the US. Lynne Sandford said: “When he first heard that Mr Trump had won, he told me: ‘I'm so glad I didn't do what I wanted to do that day, and I do accept and respect the decision of the American people.' But within 24 hours, it hit him like a sledgehammer. “He was in a terrible state, saying: ‘What if the judge decides to increase my sentence to get onside with Trump? What if Trump wants to have me bumped off in prison, what if he wants to make example of me and not let me out of prison? '” Lynne Sandford has seen her son once since he was taken into custody, but will fly to the US for his sentencing on 13 December. She said Michael had recently written her a letter saying he was struggling to get by.  “He said: ‘I can't describe how I'm feeling. Tears are streaming down my face as I write this. I miss you all and love you all more than words can explain. I need to be back home with you all. I'm so alone, cold and scared here. You all mean everything to me and I'm so sorry for how I have treated you all. I love you, I love you, I love you,'” she said. Her son has a range of acute and complex medical issues. He has had severe obsessive compulsive disorder, was sectioned aged 14, previously tried to kill himself, and has a heart condition. He was diagnosed as having been under the influence of a delusional, psychotic episode at the time of the incident.  He was initially told he faced a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison after being charged in June with disrupting an official function and two firearms offences. He is being held in custody at a US   detention centre in Nevada. “The US and UK have to agree to him serving his sentence in England. I don't think that's a problem for the English side, but once Mr Trump is president, he might not agree to it,” Lynne Sandford said. “That's what we're worried about.  “I have written to Obama and Theresa May to see if they can intervene. I'm hoping that Obama will show compassion and realise that this poor sap could be on the receiving end of Trump's anger, and I am urging him to act in any way he can while he is still in power. ”  She said she had received a standard reply from Downing Street and was yet to hear from the White House. Her son has been on suicide watch for much of his time in detention. “When he's on suicide watch, he's in isolation his cell 24 hours a day. He is not allowed anything in with him not even toilet paper, in case he rams it down his throat,” she said.  She has been told her son is being given 15 tablets a day, but not what for or what dosage. “All I know is he is being given them erratically, sometimes in one go. He's had more seizures and has been hallucinating. I would imagine this is the result of the erratic medication,” she said. Her son had lost a great deal of weight and was less than eight stone, she said. Michael, who is 5ft 10, has had anorexia nervosa in the past. “He is eating porridge in the morning and a bread roll in the evening, and that's it. He is unable to sleep at night because the lights in his cell are kept on all night. He is severely depressed,” the mother said. She said she wanted to thank Guardian readers who had donated more than £10, 000 to a Crowdjustice page set up to raise money for his legal fees after the Guardian's Weekend magazine wrote about his case. “It was an amazing response,” she said. “We were so touched and appreciative, and Michael passes on his sincerest thanks to everybody trying to help him. I'm glad readers realise that despite what he attempted to do, he's not a bad person at heart, and that he needs help. ” She has started a new Crowdjustice page to raise funds to try to bring him back to the UK to serve his sentence close to his family."
103347,151767,Inside Trump Treasury nominee's past life as 'foreclosure king' of California,Guardian,Sam Levin,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/02/steve-mnuchin-profile-donald-trump-treasury,"Lights flashing, three police cars showed up to Bill  's quiet suburban street on the morning of 15 December 2015. The Benicia, California, man had stayed up all night waiting for the sheriff's office to evict him from the house his grandparents had owned since 1971. “It was really, really traumatic,”   recalled one year later. Standing outside the locked front door, the    peered into the empty living room that holds his earliest Christmas memories and surveyed the overgrown ivy damaging the house's facade. The foreclosure  —   which he said was based on a predatory loan and improper paperwork  —   originated with lender OneWest Bank, at the time run by chairman and CEO Steven Mnuchin. The veteran Wall Street financier's foreclosure practices are receiving fresh scrutiny this week after   Trump announced him as the nominee for US Treasury secretary. “Rather than shaking up Wall Street, he installs the very person that was part of the financial mess,” said   who has effectively been homeless since the foreclosure. “I'm just thoroughly disgusted. ” Mnuchin, who is also a Hollywood movie producer, earned the nickname “foreclosure king” after he purchased distressed mortgages during the financial crisis and evicted thousands of homeowners. The former Goldman Sachs banker, worth an estimated $40m, has no government experience, and critics worry that, as Treasury secretary, his policies could benefit the wealthiest people and roll back critical bank regulations. One controversial source of OneWest foreclosures is the corporation's reverse mortgages, which are loans to elderly homeowners that enable them to borrow against their home equity. These types of mortgages have been aggressively marketed to seniors as a way to help them stay in their homes, but some don't understand the risks and can't afford associated fees. In 2006,  's grandparents bought a reverse mortgage from IndyMac Bank, the predecessor to OneWest, which he said took advantage of his grandfather, who suffered from dementia.  After his grandparents died in 2012,   moved in, but the corporation  —   by then OneWest and run by Mnuchin  —   quickly began foreclosure proceedings.  The bank's case, he said, relied on a document signed with the name “Bryan Bly” who has been widely reported in numerous investigations as a   “ ”.   are individuals whose signatures are wrongfully used to automatically authenticate thousands of mortgage documents that they haven't read and are in some cases falsely notarized.  The document, which an auditor determined was improper, makes his foreclosure illegitimate,   said, adding: “It's elder financial abuse. ” His family is still fighting the foreclosure, but in the meantime  's mother has been forced to live in a nursing home. The California Reinvestment Coalition, a   that has scrutinized OneWest, found through public records requests that the bank disproportionately foreclosed on seniors. The firm was allegedly responsible for 39% of reverse mortgages in recent years even though it only has 17% of the market.  From 2009 to 2015, the bank was responsible for more than 36, 000 total foreclosures in California, according to the coalition.  Julie Cheney, a California resident whose parents lost their home to a OneWest foreclosure stemming from a reverse mortgage, testified against OneWest before it merged with a company called CIT Group last year. (Mnuchin earned millions from the sale).  “It's so wrong,” Cheney said, explaining that the bank sold her parents a mortgage they didn't need while her father was dying of cancer and on pain medication and her mother was suffering from Alzheimer's disease.  Her family's unsuccessful court battle against OneWest was a huge strain on her mother right before she died, Cheney added. “It was the worst time of my life. ”  Maeve Elise Brown, executive director of Housing and Economic Rights Advocates, said some of the cruelest OneWest evictions she has observed involve foreclosures against recently widowed homeowners. “It's unimaginable. People are still traumatized from the death of their loved one,” she said, “and then they are faced with the second largest loss, which is the roof over their head. ”  CIT Group and Trump's transition team did not respond to requests for comment.  Foreclosures aren't the only way OneWest has inflicted harm on vulnerable people, according to critics.  In November, two   filed a complaint against the bank, alleging that it has violated the Fair Housing Act by failing to locate branches in communities of color and providing disproportionately low rates of loans to Asian Americans, African Americans and Latinos in California.  In   neighborhoods, OneWest was far more likely to foreclose on homes than make loans available, according to the charges, which claim that in 2014 and 2015, the corporation offered only two loans to black borrowers.  The complaint, which calls for an investigation by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, further accuses the corporation of allowing foreclosed properties to become blighted and abandoned in communities of color, while properly maintaining and marketing homes in white neighborhoods.  “There is a very high price to pay in terms of the health and safety of the neighborhood,” said Caroline Peattie, executive director of the Fair Housing Advocates of Northern California, which filed the complaint alongside the reinvestment coalition.  In white neighborhoods, OneWest properties generally had “manicured lawns, securely locked doors and windows, and attractive, professional, ‘for sale' signs posted out front” according to the complaint. In communities of color, the foreclosed houses “were more likely to have trash strewn about the premises, overgrown grass, shrubbery, and weeds, and boarded or broken doors and windows”. Blighted properties can attract garbage, crime and public safety hazards, she said, adding that studies have found that living near foreclosures is linked to higher blood pressure.  “It's as if a lender has turned the person's home into a piece of trash,” said Brown. “Any lender who does not maintain the property is victimizing the entire neighborhood. ”"
103364,151788,Fake news: an insidious trend that's fast becoming a global problem,Guardian,Kate Connolly,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/02/fake-news-facebook-us-election-around-the-world,"The German political mainstream is getting increasingly nervous about the effect that the rise of fake news might have on federal elections next autumn. Fake news and Russian interference  —   either by influencing fake news sites, or by hacking or misinformation  —   are viewed as a serious threat to the democratic process, particularly since the US presidential elections. From rumours that Merkel was in the east German secret police, the Stasi, to others suggesting she is Adolf Hitler's daughter, Germans are also proving themselves susceptible to false information. The most blatant example of fake news to hit Germany so far occurred earlier this year over reports that a    girl of Russian origin, known as Lisa F, had been raped in Berlin by refugees from the Middle East. The story received extensive coverage on Russian and German media who reported the allegations that she had been abducted on her way to school and  . The attack turned out to have been fabricated, as Berlin's chief of police was quick to point out. According to Berlin's public prosecutor's office the girl had spent 30 hours with people known to her, and a medical examination proved she had not been raped. But having been shared widely on social media and through Russian news sites, hundreds took to the streets to protest at the “attack” along with far right and   groups. Sergey Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister went so far as to accuse Merkel's government of “sweeping the case under the carpet” heightening suspicions in Berlin that the Kremlin was deliberately trying to cause trouble. There are suspicions that the story was spread in the first place by Russian elements keen to undermine the refugee policy of Angela Merkel. She is viewed as a key enemy to Russia over her tough stance on Ukraine. The ultimate aim is said to be to destabilise her domestically just as she has said she will stand for a fourth term in office. In an interview with Der Spiegel magazine   Maaßen  —   the head of the BfV, Germany's domestic security agency,  —   accused Russia of using   techniques of misinformation. Addressing the Bundestag on the subject last week, Merkel said: “Today we have fake sites, bots, trolls  —   things that regenerate themselves, reinforcing opinions with certain algorithms, and we have to learn to deal with them. ” Fake news has also spread to neighbouring Austria and been used to discredit both candidates in this weekend's presidential election. Most startling have been the attacks on the   independent candidate Alexander van der Bellen, whose opponents have attempted to spread the news that he is suffering from dementia and is gravely ill.  Kate Connolly, Over the last 10 years, France has seen a sharp increase in the readership of alternative,   sites, blogs and social media operations, referred to collectively as the fachosphère  —   (“facho” is slang for fascist). Promoting views including   nativism and   these sites are run independently, rather than by a political party. But they feed into a mood of distrust of the traditional media, both on the far right and the far left. Samuel Laurent, head of Le Monde's   section, Les décodeurs, said: “In France, there isn't a wide presence of totally invented fake news that makes money through advertising, as seen in the US. ” But he said France was seeing increasing cases of manipulation and distortion, particularly during election periods.  One example, in the recent primary race to choose the French right's presidential candidate, was a campaign on the fachosphère to claim the   candidate Alain Juppé was linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. The accusation dated back to local elections in 2014 when distorted stories circulated on a   opinion website, accusing Juppé of wanting to build a “ ” in Bordeaux, where he is mayor. The story grew and was embellished during the primary campaigns to portray Juppé as a Muslim   “Ali Juppé”. Juppé said a “disgusting campaign” had been run against him.  Laurent said: “I think the French presidential election campaign [next spring] will be fraught with this type of thing. ” In January, as the presidential election campaign prepares to kick off, Le Monde's Les décodeurs will launch a database of questionable sites that portray themselves as information sites. The recent Paris terrorist attacks were also subject to conspiracy theories and distortions, including reports this summer that gunmen who killed 90 people at a rock gig at the Bataclan last November had mutilated their victims. These reports cited partial evidence to a parliamentary inquiry into the attacks, without adding that the inquiry also heard officials deny that any mutilation took place. There is also an ongoing row over fake information websites about abortion in France. The lower house of the French parliament has approved government plans to ban fake abortion information websites which masquerade as neutral, official sites with   helpline numbers but which the government said promote   propaganda and pressure women not to terminate pregnancies. The women's minister, Laurence Rossignol, told parliament on Thursday that   groups in France were setting up sites “that appear neutral and objective” and copy official government information sites but were “deliberately seeking to trick women”. She said these sites often had helplines run by “  activists with no training who want to make women feel guilty and discourage them from seeking an abortion. ”  Angelique Chrisafis  A Burmese friend recently put it like this: in the old days, people went to the tea shop to get their news. Now, they go to Facebook. After decades of isolation under successive military regimes, Myanmar's 51 million people began to come online rapidly in 2014 after telecoms reforms. They leapfrogged the era of   and desktops, starting with mobile phones and social media. For many, Facebook is synonymous with the internet. With scores of voices clamoring to be heard for the first time, it's a dynamic, sometimes dangerous space. As well as “#foreveralone” statuses and a barrage of updates from staunchly   media organizations, news feeds are crammed with fake content. Much of it is tinged with religious hatred. With tensions between the majority Buddhist and minority Muslim populations running high, many are ready to believe vitriolic nonsense about Islam and its followers, often propagated by nationalist accounts set up for the purpose. A Muslim journalist was recently the victim of a campaign by some of these accounts, when a widely followed nationalist posted pictures of him juxtaposed with images of an unknown Rohingya Muslim militant. The post claimed he was involved in attacks on border police and called for his immediate arrest.  Nothing happened  —   the post was eventually taken down, though not before more than 3, 000 people shared it. But the episode was a hint of the frightening power that fake news can have in a context like Myanmar. Poppy McPherson, In Italy, the spread of propaganda has become such a worry for the government that a top official in prime minister Matteo Renzi's circle of advisers recently filed a defamation complaint against a mystery Twitter account  —   it has since disappeared  —   who tweeted under the name “Beatrice di Maio” and routinely took aim at Renzi's government. In one example, the Twitter account showed a picture of Elena Boschi, the reform minister, on the phone. It suggested she was sharing insider information with her father, who was a top executive at Banca Etruria, a Tuscan bank. The bank was rescued by the Italian government in 2015 but there is no evidence that Boschi helped her father or committed wrongdoing.  In Italy the attacks against Renzi have been stepped up ahead of the critical 4 December referendum. In some cases, news about Italy reported by Russian   website RT Today has been especially skewed against the prime minister. In one case highlighted by La Stampa, the Italian daily, the Russian website falsely claimed that a rally in Rome held by supporters of Renzi ahead of the referendum were actually his opponents. The story has since been removed.  Members of Renzi's Democratic party have complained that “ ” websites controlled by the   Five Star Movement, which abhors traditional political advertising, are to blame for spreading false and defamatory news about the government's activities.  Stephanie Kirchgaessner, As reports emerged that fake news had influenced the US presidential election, China trumpeted its system of a “internet management” portraying freedom of speech as broken when it can affect the outcome of an election. “China is on its way to strengthening internet management,” said an editorial in the Global Times, a tabloid affiliated with the Communist party mouthpiece People's Daily. “The western democratic system appears to be unable to address” the problems and conflict unleashed by the internet, the paper added. The fake news that spread on Facebook in the   to the election even spread to China. Articles originally posted on   websites, including Breitbart, were directly translated into Chinese and shared on the country's social media platforms.  Problems with fake news and fraudulent reporters have existed for over a decade in China, with people often presenting themselves as journalists and threatening companies with negative coverage in an attempt to extort money. In one   case, a journalist was paid more than $70, 000 to write negative stories about a construction equipment manufacturing company, sending its shares tumbling. But the authorities have seized on the phenomenon as a justification to censor a   of content. In 2013, the government launched a crackdown on online “ ” targeting influential users on the   website Sina Weibo, but it was widely seen as an attempt to stem criticism of the ruling Communist party. More recently, Chinese authorities have clamped down on “fake news” they feel harms social cohesiveness, targeting “rumours” that affected property prices in Shanghai or stories the government says increase antagonism between urban and rural residents.  Earlier this year China's cyberspace administration issued new rules designed to curb the number of stories using information culled from social media, stating “it is forbidden to use hearsay to create news or use conjecture and imagination to distort the facts”. News outlets cannot use information posted on social media without prior approval, it said. More recently a top official at the administration suggested there should be a database to identify internet users' true identities so they could be “rewarded and punished”. China maintains extensive control over the internet and many foreign websites, including Facebook, Google, Twitter and YouTube, are all blocked by a government program known as “the Great Firewall”.  The country's vast censorship system that imposes media blackouts on topics ranging from missteps by China's leadership to investigating corruption cases. A recent directive banned websites from live streaming coverage of the US election. Benjamin Haas, Brazil has a growing problem with fake news and its importance has grown as political opinion polarized following the close   victory of leftist president Dilma Rousseff in 2014 and her controversial impeachment in August this year. According to a BBC Brasil report from April 2016, as the impeachment process that Rousseff and her supporters called a politically motivated coup began heating up, three out of the five most shared news stories on Facebook were false.  A story shared by the Pensa Brasil (Think Brasil) site that falsely said that federal police wanted to know why Rousseff had given 30bn reais ($9bn) to the giant meat company Friboi came third in the ranking with 90, 150 shares.  Last year Brazilian journalist Tai Nalon left her job at the Folha de S Paulo, one of Brazil's leading newspapers, to found the site Aos Fatos (To The Facts)  —   Brazil's first   site. “There is a lot of false news,” Nalon said in an email interview, “but I would be cautious about saying the problem is similar to what happens in the USA”. Instead, she said there are politically motivated pages that reinterpret and distort existing stories from big news outlets and that much of what they share is more biased opinion than pure falsehood. But plenty of false stories do circulate on Brazil's garrulous internet. The   investigation into the Petrobras scandal, called Operation Car Wash, was a key driver in Rousseff's impeachment. Although she has never been accused of graft, many in her party have been and the scandal prompted huge street demonstrations calling for her removal. BuzzFeed Brasil this month published this story about how more false news about the operation has been published than real. This year, the 10 most popular false news stories about Car Wash were shared 3. 9m times, BuzzFeed said, citing Facebook data. The 10 most popular real stories were shared 2. 7m times. Dominic Phillips, Fake news is not a problem of any scale in Australia: the media market, dominated by a handful of key players serving a population of just over 21 million people, does not seem fragmented enough. But Australia is not immune to issues with untruths spreading on Facebook. Over half the population (13. 3 million as at end of June) is connected to the internet of that number, more than half is believed to be active on Facebook. Some issues seem to be more of a lightning rod for untruths in Australia than others. The link between the halal certification industry and terrorism  —   repeated by politicians despite a lack of evidence  —   was so persistent that an inquiry was held late last year. Concerns over halal certification  —   often failing to completely mask rampant Islamophobia  —   flourished on Facebook, even after the inquiry found there was no basis to the connection. The Boycott Halal in Australia group has close to 100, 000 members on Facebook. In November 2014, it shared a satirical news article, apparently under the impression it was true. The post was subsequently deleted, but the page is a hotbed for views that have no basis in fact, as is the page for supporters of the Q Society, which bills itself as “Australia's leading   movement”. Pauline Hanson, a fringe figure in rightwing politics who is outspoken against Islam, was   to the senate in the federal election in July with support that surprised many pundits. Her One Nation party took four seats in the   senate this year and the party is expected to do well in the Queensland state elections. Parallels have been drawn between her return to politics and Trump's election: both have embraced social media, where they have significant followings, and are similarly unfazed by evidence. In August, research showed 62% of voters agreed with the statement: “I might not personally agree with everything she says but she is speaking for a lot of ordinary Australians. ” She is active on Facebook, as are many of her supporters. She recently announced that the majority of her press releases would be released only on Twitter.  Elle Hunt, After India's prime minister announced the introduction of a new,   note last month, phones around the country lit up with the news the bill would come installed with a surveillance chip, linked to a satellite that could track the notes even 120 metres underground. The claims, debunked by the country's reserve bank, nonetheless spread like fire over Whatsapp  —   which has more than 50 million users in India  —   and migrated into mainstream news. As in the USA and elsewhere, increasing numbers of Indians are getting their news from social media.  But the   episode illustrates the deeper impact of fake news in a country where media is prolific, but journalistic standards, especially in regional media, can still fall short.  “Mainstream media in India is more impacted by the phenomena [of fake news] because they broadcast these kinds of stories without verifying,” says Prabhakar Kumar, from the Indian media research agency, CMS. “There is no standard policy for TV news and newspapers about the process of researching and publishing stories. ” Police have arrested people accused of concocting false stories, especially when they run the risk of igniting communal tension. Administrators of Whatsapp groups have been warned they could be held responsible for the messages they oversee.  But social media has only enabled a much older reliance on rumour and innuendo, especially in India's villages. Two boys in Dadri village, near Delhi, didn't need Whatsapp last year to spread rumours a local man was storing beef in his freezer. They broadcast from the loudspeaker at the village temple. Mohammed Akhlaq, the    labourer named by the boys, was lynched.  Michael Safi"
103400,151832,'No amnesty': Trump vows to deport millions during 'first hour in office',Guardian,Rory Carroll,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/donald-trump-vows-to-deport-millions-during-first-hour-in-office-in-hardline-speech,"Trump has vowed anew to deport millions of undocumented people and to build a wall on the border with Mexico, defying expectations that he would soften his stance on immigration. The Republican presidential candidate doubled down on his hardline stance in a speech on Wednesday night which delighted core supporters and dismayed his few remaining Latino allies who had expected a tack towards moderation. Speaking hours after a lightning visit to Mexico, Trump told a rally in Phoenix, Arizona, he was sticking with his plan for a “deportation force” to intercept illegal border crossers and hunt down criminal “illegal aliens” already in the US. “We are going to take our country back,” he said, repeating a mantra from the primary campaign. Speaking largely from a teleprompter, he also reiterated his vow to make Mexico pay for a   wall which, he said, would bristle with sensors, towers and guards. “We will build a great wall along the southern border. And Mexico will pay for the wall, 100%. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for it. ” Trailing Clinton in the polls with just 69 days to the election, Trump and campaign aides had recently fuelled expectations of a “softening” of immigration policy, prompting speculation about a  . Instead the speech, which his campaign billed as a major policy address, represented an abrupt reversion to an aggressive tone just hours after an unfamiliar conciliatory timbre in Mexico City, where Trump met President Enrique Peña Nieto. The Republicans nominee roused the crowd in Phoenix with grisly details about murders committed by undocumented immigrants. He brought on stage “angel moms” whose children were killed. He spoke of cancelling an Obama administration programme that gives work permits to about 800, 000 young immigrants who came to the US as children  —   a stance likely to slam shut any chance of Latino outreach. Anybody who entered the US illegally would be subject to deportation and there should be detainers for immigrants who committed any crime, not just felonies, he said. “There will be no amnesty. ” Trump also promised ideological tests for   visa applicants, a “sunset” on visa laws requiring Congress to rewrite them every few years and a ban on taxpayer funding for cities that don't deport undocumented immigrants. The rhetoric trampled over the hopes of Trump's dwindling band of conservative Latino supporters. “This is how I feel: disappointed and misled,” tweeted Alfonso Aguilar, head of Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles. Jacob Monty, a member of Trump's National Hispanic advisory council, resigned, Politico reported. The rightwing columnist Ann Coulter, in contrast, exulted. “Wow. This doesn't sound like “softening. ” GO, TRUMP! !!” she tweeted. Trump did however imply most of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants would remain untouched while his putative administration focused on deporting 2 million with alleged criminal records. “We will begin moving them out, day one. My first hour in office, those people are gone. ” The ambiguity over the fate of   undocumented immigrants marked a tacit retreat from Trump's earlier vows to swiftly deport all 11 million people. The lack of clarity allowed supporters and critics to fill in the blanks with their own wishes and anxieties. Trump's policy could in theory yet resemble that of Obama, who has deported millions, and Republicans rivals such as Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, whom Trump accused of supporting de facto amnesty. The speech capped a whirlwind day of political theatre in which Trump, after a year of denigrating Mexican immigrants as rapists, murderers and drug dealers, met President Peña Nieto in Mexico City, triggering a backlash from Mexicans who denounced the NY businessman as a tyrant, and worse. Trump emerged from the private meeting at Los Pinos, the presidential residence, heaping praise on Mexican immigrants. “They are amazing people, amazing people . .. Mexicans are just beyond reproach. Spectacular, spectacular and hardworking people. ” He said the   meeting with Peña Nieto was “substantive” and “excellent” but did not touch on his pledge to force Mexico to pay for the wall. “We're saving that discussion for a later date. ” Mexico's president however said he did broach the topic and told Trump Mexico would not pay. In a late evening television interview, an   Peña Nieto said: “His policy stances could represent a huge threat to Mexico, and I am not prepared to keep my arms crossed and do nothing. “That risk, that threat, must be confronted. I told him that is not the way to build a mutually beneficial relationship for both nations. ”  Clinton's campaign, sidelined by another day of Trump drama, seized on the discrepancy: “It turns out Trump didn't just choke, he got beat in the room and lied about it. ” The unexpected visit  —   Trump's first meeting with a head of state since he became a candidate  —   yielded presidential optics in the form of a podium and marble backdrop in an international setting. Speaking beneath a Mexican flag the casino   reality TV star sounded restrained and diplomatic. That evaporated when he bounded onto the podium in Phoenix, 200 miles north of the border, and seemed energised by the crowd, even though the cavernous convention centre was  . “There is only one core issue in the immigration debate and that is the wellbeing of the American people. Nothing even comes a close second. Our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens. ” The audience cheered and chanted “USA”. Maricopa county sheriff Joe Arpaio, a controversial hunter of suspected undocumented people, NY's former mayor Rudy Giuliani and Trump's running mate, Indiana governor Pence, warmed up the crowd before Trump arrived.  Supporters hailed his   foray as evidence he could negotiate with foreign leaders and secure US interests. George Buchanan, 71, a retired flooring installer, said it also showed courage. “It's dangerous. You've got those Mexican people over there, drug lords. The drug lords don't want him to build the wall. ” Some in the crowd sensed that behind the brash reiteration of mass deportations Trump was in fact edging towards a more moderate, viable, policy. “I think he's loosening up, becoming more realistic,” said Nancy Lewis, 56, a retired law enforcer. “And I'm OK with that. I have Hispanic friends. ” Michelle Des Marais, 78, appeared willing to forgive Trump if he did end up retreating. “It's a hard fight but at least he's trying. ”"
103522,151991,Longtime matchmaker Joe Silva reportedly retiring after sale of UFC,Guardian,Les Carpenter,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/01/joe-silva-ufc-matchmaker-retiring-after-sale-reports,"In a development that might significantly affect the Ultimate Fighting Championship going forward, the organization's top matchmaker Joe Silva is reportedly retiring. MMAjunkie first reported the news on Wendesday night saying that Silva might leave the world's leading mixed martial arts promotion by the end of the year. Silva maintains a    presence at the organization and is rarely interviewed, but his ability to assess fighters and pair them in intriguing matchups has been a big part of the UFC's success. His role predates the tenures of president Dana White and outgoing owners Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta, who took over the UFC and made it a   dollar industry. A big part of the reason the UFC has been able to rise is the ability of their management to find compelling fights and package them in glossy    productions. Since the UFC controls the fate of their fighters, they mostly dictate the bouts. The fighters generally accept the proposed fights or risk being dropped. The MMAjunkie story says Silva is leaving after earning a share of the UFC's sale to   this summer. His timing might be fortuitous depending on how much interest Congress shows in trying to apply the Ali Act to mixed martial arts. Oklahoma congressman Markwayne Mullin is pushing to extend the 2000 boxing law to the UFC.  Among the Ali Act's provisions are stipulations that promoters must open their books to fighters, can't enter into   contracts with fighters and have to use independent rankings in putting together championship bouts. Application of the law could extend more power to the fighters, but it might also hamper the UFC's ability to put together the most attractive bouts. "
103719,152264,Andy Murray overcomes ‘tough and tricky' spell against Marcel Granollers,Guardian,Kevin Mitchell,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/01/andy-murray-marcel-granollers-arthur-ashe,"Andy Murray was pleased to come through a difficult period against Marcel Granollers as he recorded his second successive   win to reach the third round of the US Open. “There was a   to   period in the match where it was tough and tricky,” he said of his       win in two hours and 22 minutes over the Spaniard under the roof on Arthur Ashe on day four. That followed his opening win in similarly convincing fashion against the altogether different skills of Lukas Rosol on Monday. He added: “I got myself in a situation that maybe I could have avoided if I had taken one or two of the set points that I had at   or  . But I thought I did pretty well. There were some good points in there. That period of the match was very tough. I didn't play that well during that period and managed to come through it, thankfully, and play some good stuff in the second and third sets. “I served at like 40, 42% first serves or something and still won in straight sets. I must have been doing things well other than serving. I was obviously hitting the ball pretty well and returning pretty good. But I could serve better, for sure. I only got broken once in a game where I had game points. It was all right. ” Murray said playing under the new roof provided some new challenges  —   not the least of them having to pick up the sound of the ball against the background of an echo in the cavernous stadium. “I don't think it was too different to the other night when I played but, when the rain came, it was certainly loud. You can't hear anything, really. You could hear the line calls, but not so much the opponent's [shots] when he was hitting the ball or even when you're hitting the ball, really, which is tough purely because we're not used to it. That's what makes it challenging. “We use our ears when we play. It's not just the eyes. It helps us pick up the speed of the ball, the spin that's on the ball, how hard someone's hitting it. If we played with our ears covered or with headphones on, it would be a big advantage if your opponent wasn't wearing them. It's tricky. You know, you can still do it but it's harder, for sure. “It's definitely louder [than Wimbledon] but I don't think it changed the conditions on the court as much as it does at Wimbledon. “When the roof is on, the humidity picks up significantly [at Wimbledon] whereas here it's always humid, even when the roof is open. ”"
103909,152512,'A powerful moment': first US-to-Cuba flight since 1961 is latest step in thaw,Guardian,Richard Luscombe,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/us-cuba-first-flight-jetblue-fort-lauderdale,"To the lively beat of a salsa band, and with a water cannon   from airport fire trucks, the first commercial flight between the US and Cuba since 1961 took off from Florida on Wednesday, a symbolic next step in the new era of détente between the former cold war adversaries. Among the passengers aboard JetBlue flight 387 from Fort Lauderdale to Santa Clara were many Cuban exiles returning to their homeland for the first time in years, and the US transport secretary, Anthony Foxx, headed for talks with his counterparts in Havana. Wednesday's historic flight, which took off 20 minutes late at 10. 05am after a lengthy party at the departure gate, will eventually lead to 110 flights to and from Cuba daily from the US. Foxx said he was expecting to announce the first dates for Havana later in the day. But for many of the passengers heading for the central Cuban city of Santa Clara on Wednesday, the journey was a celebration of the newfound personal freedoms the return of scheduled flights has brought, including the ability for travellers to book their own flights online at less than half the cost of the charter airlines who have been the mainstay of fractured travel links between the nations for the past 15 years. Among the first passengers to board was Nimaris   with fiance Mario Martínez and their two daughters, Daniella, three, and Olivia, 10 months. As a young girl in Sagua La Grande, González always dreamed of one day getting married in the tiny village church near her family's home, but gave up on the idea when she left Cuba for Florida as a teenager 13 years ago. It will be a busy weeklong trip for González, a surgery nurse in Orlando. She will celebrate her 30th birthday tonight with her younger brother, whom she has not seen for 12 years, and on Thursday the couple will finally get their marriage ceremony in a Cuban church. “I always wanted to get married in the church I grew up in, and our children will be baptised there on the same day, so it's a very emotional time,” González said. “The trip was sort of a birthday present, and for it to be on this flight today makes it more special. ” Martínez, 28, was born in Santa Clara but moved to central Florida with his parents as a child and has not been able to go home to visit his grandmother since 2004. “It's freedom for us in that we no longer have to go to agents where they charge $500 for a ticket,” he said. “It's good to see the relationship moving forward and travel opening up, but things in Cuba don't change much. ” Jet Blue is one of a handful of   airlines who won approval from the state department to operate to and from Cuba earlier this year following the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the government in Havana. It also offers flights to Camaguey and Holguín and hopes to add daily flights to Havana shortly. American Airlines, meanwhile, begins scheduled services from Miami, home to Florida's largest concentration of Cuban Americans, on 7 September. The airlines hope to cash in on a surge in visitors to Cuba from the US, which grew to 161, 000 in 2015, a 77% increase over the previous year according to government figures. Yet although the skies are reopening for the first time since the US broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1961, two years after Fidel Castro's communist revolution, Obama has been unable to persuade Congress to lift the   trade embargo. To the Cuban government's chagrin, American citizens booking tickets must fall into one of 12 narrowly defined categories, including travel for religious, educational or cultural reasons. “This process of establishing regular flights is a step although the restrictions of the blockade remain, which among other things impede US citizens from travelling to our country as tourists,” the Cuban foreign minister, Eduardo Rodríguez Padilla, told reporters on Monday at a press conference in Havana. In an interview with the Guardian on Wednesday, Foxx said the Obama administration was working hard on continuing to bring down the barriers, a process announced publicly in December 2014 after months of secret talks with Cuban officials. “Today is one of the most tangible examples of the president's vision for restored diplomatic relations with Cuba,” Foxx said. “This is part of a larger objective we have right now to really nudge Cuba towards progress in the 21st century, economically, politically and on so many other fronts. ” Foxx said he planned to announce later on Wednesday the “slot allocations” to Havana for US airlines after a meeting with Rodríguez Padilla. “There are a few other areas we will explore on the transportation connections between the two countries and creating better access in the longer term. ” The restoration of air links follows the historic docking in Havana in May of the Carnival cruise ship Adonia, the first such voyage in five decades, carrying more than 700 passengers. Passenger Julio César Valdés, also from Santa Clara, was looking forward to reuniting with his parents Teresa and Osnedo at his childhood home, and spending time with his    sister. “It's a very emotional and wonderful day,” said Valdés, a medical assistant who lives in Jacksonville, Florida. “This is a new step in relations between the US and Cuba and I hope to see it progress further. ”   dentist Edelio González, 52, who has lived in south Florida for 36 years, said he has travelled regularly on charter flights to Santa Clara since 2001, but feels that today's flight was “a powerful moment”. “The first flight in more than 50 years is just historic,” said González, who will spend a week with his    sister. “I wanted to be here. ”"

Frosty risk assessor Kate Mara's investigations into the mishandling of the eponymous hybrid intelligence (The Witch's   Anya  ) permits Scott Jr a good hour of existential unease: is it the placid Morgan or her intemperate human overseers (Toby Jones, Michelle Yeoh, Paul Giamatti) who pose the greater threat to this shadowy corporation's safe operation? Alas, once that question is resolved, the film turns into a passably schlocky runaround, bound for a guessable   twist that has an obvious precedent in the Scott canon.  The capable cast yank us through the chicanery, making welcome gestures towards a number of   ideas, but “  Frankenstein” isn't one of the film's smarter or more original ones."
104066,152706,How algorithms rule our working lives,Guardian,Cathy O'Neil,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/01/how-algorithms-rule-our-working-lives,"A few years ago, a young man named Kyle Behm took a leave from his studies at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. He was suffering from bipolar disorder and needed time to get treatment. A year and a half later, Kyle was healthy enough to return to his studies at a different university. Around that time, he learned from a friend about a   job. It was just a   job at a Kroger supermarket, but it seemed like a sure thing. His friend, who was leaving the job, could vouch for him. For a   student like Kyle, the application looked like a formality. But Kyle didn't get called in for an interview. When he inquired, his friend explained to him that he had been “ ” by the personality test he'd taken when he applied for the job. The test was part of an employee selection program developed by Kronos, a workforce management company based outside Boston. When Kyle told his father, Roland, an attorney, what had happened, his father asked him what kind of questions had appeared on the test. Kyle said that they were very much like the “five factor model” test, which he'd been given at the hospital. That test grades people for extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to ideas. At first, losing one   job because of a questionable test didn't seem like such a big deal. Roland Behm urged his son to apply elsewhere. But Kyle came back each time with the same news. The companies he was applying to were all using the same test, and he wasn't getting offers. Roland Behm was bewildered. Questions about mental health appeared to be blackballing his son from the job market. He decided to look into it and soon learned that the use of personality tests for hiring was indeed widespread among large corporations. And yet he found very few legal challenges to this practice. As he explained to me, people who apply for a job and are   rarely learn that they were rejected because of their test results. Even when they do, they're not likely to contact a lawyer.  Membership Event: The Long Read live   at the Hospital Club  Behm went on to send notices to seven companies, including Home Depot and Walgreens, informing them of his intent to file a   suit alleging that the use of the exam during the job application process was unlawful. The suit, as I write this, is still pending. Arguments are likely to focus on whether the Kronos test can be considered a medical exam, the use of which in hiring is illegal under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. If this turns out to be the case, the court will have to determine whether the hiring companies themselves are responsible for running afoul of the ADA, or if Kronos is. But the questions raised by this case go far beyond which particular company may or may not be responsible. Automatic systems based on complicated mathematical formulas, such as the one used to sift through Behm's job application, are becoming more common across the developed world. And given their scale and importance, combined with their secrecy, these algorithms have the potential to create an underclass of people who will find themselves increasingly and inexplicably shut out from normal life. It didn't have to be this way. After the financial crash, it became clear that the housing crisis and the collapse of major financial institutions had been aided and abetted by mathematicians wielding magic formulas. If we had been   we would have taken a step back at this point to figure out how we could prevent a similar catastrophe in the future. But instead, in the wake of the crisis, new mathematical techniques were hotter than ever, and expanding into still more domains. They churned   through petabytes of information, much of it scraped from social media or   websites. And increasingly they focused not on the movements of global financial markets but on human beings, on us. Mathematicians and statisticians were studying our desires, movements, and spending patterns. They were predicting our trustworthiness and calculating our potential as students, workers, lovers, criminals. This was the big data economy, and it promised spectacular gains. A computer program could speed through thousands of résumés or loan applications in a second or two and sort them into neat lists, with the most promising candidates on top. This not only saved time but also was marketed as fair and objective. After all, it didn't involve prejudiced humans digging through reams of paper, just machines processing cold numbers. By 2010 or so, mathematics was asserting itself as never before in human affairs, and the public largely welcomed it. Most of these algorithmic applications were created with good intentions. The goal was to replace subjective judgments with objective measurements in any number of fields  —   whether it was a way to locate the   teachers in a school or to estimate the chances that a prisoner would return to jail. These algorithmic “solutions” are targeted at genuine problems. School principals cannot be relied upon to consistently flag problematic teachers, because those teachers are also often their friends. And judges are only human, and being human they have prejudices that prevent them from being entirely fair  —   their rulings have been shown to be harsher right before lunch, when they're hungry, for example  —   so it's a worthy goal to increase consistency, especially if you can rest assured that the newer system is also scientifically sound. The difficulty is that last part. Few of the algorithms and scoring systems have been vetted with scientific rigour, and there are good reasons to suspect they wouldn't pass such tests. For instance, automated teacher assessments can vary widely from year to year, putting their accuracy in question. Tim Clifford, a NY City middle school English teacher of 26 years, got a 6 out of 100 in one year and a 96 the next, without changing his teaching style. Of course, if the scores didn't matter, that would be one thing, but sometimes the consequences are dire, leading to teachers being fired. There are also reasons to worry about scoring criminal defendants rather than relying on a judge's discretion. Consider the data pouring into the algorithms. In part, it comes from police interactions with the populace, which is known to be uneven, often  . The other kind of input, usually a questionnaire, is also troublesome. Some of them even ask defendants if their families have a history of being in trouble with the law, which would be unconstitutional if asked in open court but gets embedded in the defendant's score and labelled “objective”. It doesn't stop there. Algorithms are being used to determine how much we pay for insurance (more if your credit score is low, even if your driving record is clean) or what the terms of our loans will be, or what kind of political messaging we'll receive. There are algorithms that find out the weather forecast and only then decide on the work schedule of thousands of people, laying waste to their ability to plan for childcare and schooling, never mind a second job. Their popularity relies on the notion they are objective, but the algorithms that power the data economy are based on choices made by fallible human beings. And, while some of them were made with good intentions, the algorithms encode human prejudice, misunderstanding, and bias into automatic systems that increasingly manage our lives. Like gods, these mathematical models are opaque, their workings invisible to all but the highest priests in their domain: mathematicians and computer scientists. Their verdicts, even when wrong or harmful, are beyond dispute or appeal. And they tend to punish the poor and the oppressed in our society, while making the rich richer. That's what Kyle Behm learned the hard way. Finding work used to be largely a question of whom you knew. In fact, Kyle Behm was following the traditional route when he applied for work at Kroger. His friend had alerted him to the opening and put in a good word. For decades, that was how people got a foot in the door, whether at grocers, banks, or law firms. Candidates then usually faced an interview, where a manager would try to get a feel for them. All too often this translated into a single basic judgment: is this person like me (or others I get along with)? The result was a lack of opportunity for job seekers without a friend inside, especially if they came from a different race, ethnic group, or religion. Women also found themselves excluded by this insider game. Companies like Kronos brought science into corporate human resources in part to make the process fairer. Founded in the 1970s by MIT graduates, Kronos's first product was a new kind of punch clock, one equipped with a microprocessor, which added up employees' hours and reported them automatically. This may sound banal, but it was the beginning of the electronic push  —   now blazing along at warp speed  —   to track and optimise a workforce. As Kronos grew, it developed a broad range of software tools for workforce management, including a software program, Workforce Ready HR, that promised to eliminate “the guesswork” in hiring. According to its web page, Kronos “can help you screen, hire, and onboard candidates most likely to be productive  —   the   employees who will perform better and stay on the job longer”. Kronos is part of a growing industry. The hiring business is becoming automated, and many of the new programs include personality tests like the one Kyle Behm took. It is now a $500 million annual business and is growing by 10 to 15% a year, according to Hogan Assessment Systems Inc, a company that develops online personality tests. Such tests now are used on 60 to 70% of prospective workers in the US, and in the UK, according to the Association of Graduate Recruiters, 71% of employers use some form of psychometric test for recruitment. Even putting aside the issues of fairness and legality, research suggests that personality tests are poor predictors of job performance. Frank Schmidt, a business professor at the University of Iowa, analysed a century of workplace productivity data to measure the predictive value of various selection processes. Personality tests ranked low on the scale  —   they were only   as predictive as cognitive exams, and also far below reference checks. “The primary purpose of the test,” said Roland Behm, “is not to find the best employee. It's to exclude as many people as possible as cheaply as possible. ” You might think that personality tests would be easy to game. If you go online to take a five factor personality test, it looks like a cinch. One question asks: “Have frequent mood swings?” It would probably be smart to answer “very inaccurate. ” Another asks: “Get mad easily?” Again, check no. In fact, companies can get in trouble for screening out applicants on the basis of such questions. Regulators in Rhode Island found that CVS Pharmacy was illegally screening out applicants with mental illnesses when a personality test required respondents to agree or disagree with such statements as “People do a lot of things that make you angry” and “There's no use having close friends they always let you down. ” More intricate questions, which are harder to game, are more likely to keep the companies out of trouble. Consequently, many of the tests used today force applicants to make difficult choices, likely to leave them with a sinking feeling of “Damned if I do, damned if I don't”. McDonald's, for example, recently asked prospective workers to choose which of the following best described them: “It is difficult to be cheerful when there are many problems to take care of” or “Sometimes, I need a push to get started on my work. ” In 2014, the Wall Street Journal asked a psychologist who studies behaviour in the workplace, Tomas   to analyse thorny questions like these. The first of the two answers to the question from McDonald's,   said, captured “individual differences in neuroticism and conscientiousness” the second, “low ambition and drive”. So the prospective worker is pleading guilty to being either   or lazy. A Kroger supermarket question was far simpler: Which adjective best describes you at work, unique or orderly? Answering “unique” said   captures “high   openness and narcissism” while “orderly” expresses conscientiousness and  . Note that there's no option to answer “all of the above”. Prospective workers must pick one option, without a clue as to how the program will interpret it. And some of the analysis will draw unflattering conclusions. Defenders of the tests note that they feature lots of questions and that no single answer can disqualify an applicant. Certain patterns of answers, however, can and do disqualify them. And we do not know what those patterns are. We're not told what the tests are looking for. The process is entirely opaque. What's worse, after the model is calibrated by technical experts, it receives precious little feedback. Sports provide a good contrast here. Most professional basketball teams employ data geeks, who run models that analyse players by a series of metrics, including foot speed, vertical leap,   percentage, and a host of other variables. Teams rely on these models when deciding whether or not to recruit players. But if, say, the Los Angeles Lakers decide to pass on a player because his stats suggest that he won't succeed, and then that player subsequently becomes a star, the Lakers can return to their model to see what they got wrong. Whatever the case, they can work to improve their model. Now imagine that Kyle Behm, after getting   at Kroger, goes on to land a job at McDonald's. He turns into a stellar employee. He's managing the kitchen within four months and the entire franchise a year later. Will anyone at Kroger go back to the personality test and investigate how they could have got it so wrong? Not a chance, I'd say. The difference is this: Basketball teams are managing individuals, each one potentially worth millions of dollars. Their analytics engines are crucial to their competitive advantage, and they are hungry for data. Without constant feedback, their systems grow outdated and dumb. The companies hiring   workers, by contrast, act as if they are managing herds. They slash expenses by replacing human resources professionals with machines, and those machines filter large populations into more manageable groups. Unless something goes haywire in the workforce  —   an outbreak of kleptomania, say, or plummeting productivity  —   the company has little reason to tweak the filtering model. It's doing its job  —   even if it misses out on potential stars. The company may be satisfied with the status quo, but the victims of its automatic systems suffer. The majority of job applicants, thankfully, are not blackballed by automatic systems. But they still face the challenge of moving their application to the top of the pile and landing an interview. This has long been a problem for racial and ethnic minorities, as well as women. The ideal way to circumvent such prejudice is to consider applicants blindly. Orchestras, which had long been dominated by men, famously started in the 1970s to hold auditions with the musician hidden behind a sheet. Connections, reputations, race or alma mater no longer mattered. The music from behind the sheet spoke for itself. Since then, the percentage of women playing in major orchestras has leapt by a factor of five  —   though they still make up only a quarter of the musicians. The trouble is that few professions can engineer such an evenhanded tryout for job applicants. Musicians behind the sheet can actually perform the job they're applying for, whether it's a Dvořák cello concerto or bossa nova on guitar. In other professions, employers have to hunt through CVs, looking for qualities that might predict success. As you might expect, human resources departments rely on automatic systems to winnow down piles of résumés. In fact, in the US, some 72% of CVs are never seen by human eyes. Computer programs flip through them, pulling out the skills and experiences that the employer is looking for. Then they score each CV as a match for the job opening. It's up to the people in the human resources department to decide where the cutoff is, but the more candidates they can eliminate with this first screening, the fewer human hours they'll have to spend processing the top matches. So job applicants must craft their résumés with that automatic reader in mind. It's important, for example, to sprinkle the résumé liberally with words the specific job opening is looking for. This could include previous positions (sales manager, software architect) languages (Mandarin, Java) or honours (summa cum laude). Those with the latest information learn what machines appreciate and what tangles them up, and tailor their applications accordingly. The result of these programs is that those with the money and resources to prepare their résumés come out on top. Those who don't take these steps may never know that they're sending their résumés into a black hole. It's one more example in which the wealthy and informed get the edge and the poor are more likely to lose out. So far, we've been looking at models that filter out job candidates. For most companies, those models are designed to cut administrative costs and to reduce the risk of bad hires (or ones that might require more training). The objective of the filters, in short, is to save money. HR departments, of course, are also eager to save money through the hiring choices they make. One of the biggest expenses for a company is workforce turnover, commonly called churn. Replacing a worker earning $50, 000 a year costs a company about $10, 000, or 20% of that worker's yearly pay, according to the Center for American Progress. Replacing a   employee can cost as much as two years of salary. Naturally, many hiring models attempt to calculate the likelihood that a job candidate will stick around. Evolv, Inc, now a part of Cornerstone OnDemand, helped Xerox scout out prospects for its call centres, which employ more than 40, 000 people. The churn model took into account some of the metrics you might expect, including the average time people stuck around on previous jobs. But they also found some intriguing correlations. People the system classified as “creative types” tended to stay longer at the job, while those who scored high on “inquisitiveness” were more likely to set their questioning minds towards other opportunities. But the most problematic correlation had to do with geography. Job applicants who lived farther from the job were more likely to churn. This makes sense: long commutes are a pain. But Xerox managers noticed another correlation. Many of the people suffering those long commutes were coming from poor neighbourhoods. So Xerox, to its credit, removed that highly correlated churn data from its model. The company sacrificed a bit of efficiency for fairness. While churn analysis focuses on the candidates most likely to fail, the more strategically vital job for HR departments is to locate future stars, the people whose intelligence, inventiveness, and drive can change the course of an entire enterprise. In the higher echelons of the economy, companies are on the hunt for employees who think creatively and work well in teams. So the modellers' challenge is to pinpoint, in the vast world of big data, the bits of information that correlate with originality and social skills. A pioneer in this field is Gild, a San Francisco —  based startup. Extending far beyond a prospect's alma mater or résumé, Gild sorts through millions of job sites, analysing what it calls each person's “social data”. The company develops profiles of job candidates for its customers, mostly tech companies, keeping them up to date as the candidates add new skills. Gild claims that it can even predict when a star employee is likely to change jobs and can alert its customer companies when it's the right time to make an offer. But Gild's model attempts to quantify and also qualify each worker's “social capital”. How integral is this person to the community of fellow programmers? Do they share and contribute code? Say a Brazilian coder  —   Pedro, let's call him  —   lives in São Paulo and spends every evening from dinner to one in the morning in communion with fellow coders the world over, solving   problems or brainstorming gaming algorithms on sites such as GitHub or Stack Overflow. The model could attempt to gauge Pedro's passion (which probably gets a high score) and his level of engagement with others. It would also evaluate the skill and social importance of his contacts. Those with larger followings would count for more. If his principal online contact happened to be Google's Sergey Brin, say, Pedro's social score would no doubt shoot through the roof. But models like Gild's rarely receive such explicit signals from the data. So they cast a wider net, in search of correlations to workplace stardom wherever they can find them. And with more than six million coders in their database, the company can find all kinds of patterns. Vivienne Ming, Gild's chief scientist, said in an interview with Atlantic Monthly that Gild had found a bevy of talent frequenting a certain Japanese manga site. If Pedro spends time at that   site, of course, it doesn't predict superstardom. But it does nudge up his score. That makes sense for Pedro. But certain workers might be doing something else offline, which even the most sophisticated algorithm couldn't infer  —   at least not today. They might be taking care of children, for example, or perhaps attending a book group. The fact that prospects don't spend six hours discussing manga every evening shouldn't be counted against them. And if, like most of techdom, that manga site is dominated by males and has a sexist tone, a good number of the women in the industry will probably avoid it. Despite these issues, Gild's category of predictive model has more to do with rewarding people than punishing them. It is tame compared with   personality tests that exclude people from opportunities. Still, it's important to note that these hiring models are  . The world of data continues to expand, with each of us producing   streams of updates about our lives. All of this data will feed our potential employers insights into us. Will those insights be tested, or simply used to justify the status quo and reinforce prejudices? When I consider the sloppy and   ways that companies often use data, I'm reminded of phrenology, a pseudoscience that was briefly popular in the 19th century. Phrenologists would run their fingers over the patient's skull, probing for bumps and indentations. Each one, they thought, was linked to personality traits. If a patient was morbidly anxious or suffering from alcoholism, the skull probe would usually find bumps and dips that correlated with that observation  —   which, in turn, bolstered faith in the science of phrenology. Phrenology was a model that relied on pseudoscientific nonsense to make authoritative pronouncements, and for decades it went untested. Big data can fall into the same trap. Models like the ones that   Kyle Behm continue to lock people out, even when the “science” inside them is little more than a bundle of untested assumptions. • Mail illustration: Nathalie Lees, This essay is adapted from Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy, published by Allen Lane on 6 September, • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here"
104138,152798,I'm on the 'professor watchlist.' It's a ploy to undermine free speech,Guardian,Anthea Butler,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/02/us-universities-professor-watchlist-free-speech,"The release of the professor watchlist, purporting to expose professors who discriminate against conservative students, is anything but that. I should know: I'm on it. As one of a handful of religion professors in the US who study, write and teach about conservative Christianity and politics, I am all too aware of the real meaning of the list, and of its purpose. Promoted by Turning Point USA, the list is not simply designed to expose professors who discriminate it is designed to silence and smear. And it helps feed information and screeds to similar sites like the College Fix and Campus Reform, which states that they are “a watchdog to the nation's higher education system” to “expose bias and abuse on the nations college campuses”. Charles Kirk, a young leader in conservative politics, who is the publisher of the list and co founder of Turning Point USA, stated that he hopes that the professor watchlist will change campus culture by highlighting previously reported incidences and statements. It very well might. Turning Point USA has chapters on over 300 college campuses across the USA, and even more on high school campuses.  For a group claiming to be a watchdog to higher education, the organization is training students from high school in how to not engage their education critically, but to combat anything or anyone that does not promote or teach with a conservative viewpoint. It is an   bid to control not only academic freedom in the university setting, but to create a hostile climate for free speech and academic freedom.  Rightwing organizations like Turning Point USA or Leadership Institute spend considerable amounts of money and time to train students with conservative values how to “fight back”. Their efforts on campuses not only promote conservative values but also feed the large   media complex  —   sites like Town Hall and Breitbart. Many of the articles that are published by College Reform end up being reported by other outlets within hours, and in some cases, picked up by Fox News. Professors targeted remain blissfully unaware until their inbox fills with hate mail, and the administration has to field calls from media outlets and disgruntled conservatives.  Many professors and university officials do not know that these organizations, populated by their own students, exist. They are left flatfooted when lists like the Professor Watchlist appear, because these organizations are not only about promoting the idea that university education is hostile to conservatism, but also to get the maximum amount of exposure for their beliefs.  For tenured professors like myself, the Professor Watchlist is an annoyance that takes away from research, teaching and time with students. For professors on the tenure track, or lecturers who are trying to keep a contract job, being named on the professor watchlist could mean diminished opportunities for their careers if colleges and universities do not understand the purpose and nature of these groups.  These types of attempts to influence campus culture and teaching are disturbing. It creates an environment where the very idea and understanding of academic freedom and first amendment rights are called into question  —   not only by students, but also by   outsiders with agendas. It also creates an environment of distrust. Students are being trained not only to report on professors, but on student events as well. At the University of Pennsylvania, a campus event the day after the presidential election in a dorm to provide a “breathing space” was reported on by a student who mocked the presence of coloring books, cats and dogs.  This type of “reporting” is Orwellian. Yet there are students in our midst on campuses who feel that that they need to report on, rather than engage with, other perspectives.  The irony of all of this is that while I am on the Professor Watchlist, I am probably one of the few professors in America who encourages the students who take my Religious Right in America course to attend conferences like CPAC and Values Voters Summit. No one censors my class when I ask students to watch clips of Ronald Reagan, Phyllis Schalfly or William F Buckley. I can teach a course like Religious Right in America at the University of Pennsylvania because of the institution's commitment to academic freedom and discourse.  So when groups like Turning Point USA say that I should be watched because I am advancing a radical agenda in the lecture hall, maybe I should. I'm teaching about their organizations, and how conservatives think. Radical indeed. "
104183,152859,Same old Trump: Ohio 'thank you' stop has all the trappings of a campaign rally,Guardian,Ben Jacobs,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/02/donald-trump-ohio-thank-you-tour-rally,"Trump's rally in Cincinnati on Thursday night was almost identical to any of the hundreds of public speeches he has held since announcing he was running for president in June 2015. He aired grievances and launched broadsides against political rivals and the media. The crowd chanted “lock her up” when he mentioned Clinton, and “build that wall” when he talked about immigration. But there was one difference. Trump was holding the rally as   nearly a month after the general election was held. The Cincinnati event represented the first stop of Trump's unorthodox “USA Thank You Tour” which is expected to take in   rallies in a number of the swing states whose support won him the White House in November.  But instead of thanking voters who supported him, the   devoted much of his energy to targeting those who had stood in his way. In addition to a familiar tirade against the “dishonest media”  —   whom Trump particularly blamed for not calling his win in Pennsylvania in a timely manner on election night, as well as for reporting that Trump might lose in states such as Utah and Georgia where he eventually won  —   he also bashed former rivals. He took veiled shots at Ohio governor John Kasich for not supporting him in the general election, and derided Evan McMullin, a conservative   candidate who ran a competitive campaign in Utah, as “some guy”. He seemed nostalgic for his old foe Clinton, remarking to the crowd: “We did have a lot of fun fighting Hillary, didn't we?” He did not directly criticize the former Democratic nominee, although the crowd responded with the chant of “lock her up” that had frequently punctuated his campaign rallies. The   also returned to the nationalist and nativist rhetoric on which he had based his campaign. “There is no global anthem, no global currency,” he said as he pledged yet again to put “America First”. He blamed terrorist attacks in the US on the admission of refugees by “stupid politicians” and claimed that an unidentified foreign leader told him “I truly respect the USA again” because of his election. The former reality television star also resorted to some of his usual showmanship. The   who has been parading potential cabinet appointments like contestants on a dating show, announced his nomination of former marine corps general James Mattis to be secretary of defense seemingly unprompted from the stage.  “I don't want to tell you to this, I refuse to tell you, don't let it outside of this room,” he told the crowd. “I will not tell you that one of our great, great generals, don't let it outside, we are going to appoint ‘Mad Dog' Mattis as our secretary of defense and we're not announcing it until Monday, so don't tell it to anybody. ”  Although the Washington Post had first reported Mattis's appointment earlier in the afternoon, Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller had firmly denied it, insisting on Twitter only hours before Trump took the stage: “No decision has been made yet with regard to Secretary of Defense. ” As preoccupied as ever with television ratings, Trump boasted that the election had driven down viewing figures for the NFL because “this business is tougher than the NFL. It's crazy. The people liked it. ” The   went on to brag of the election results: “The bottom line is we won. We won. We won big,” with a glee that might have drawn him a penalty for excessive celebration had he been a football player on the gridiron. The crowd, dressed in shirts and hats that proclaimed their desire to “make America great again” or attempted to reclaim Clinton's description of some Trump supporters as “deplorables” seemed optimistic about the  's chances of bringing change to Washington.  Joe Terry of Cincinnati, a   man with a   buzzcut, saw Trump's election as “the beginning of a grassroots movement” to reform US politics, which he currently saw as being defined by “a lot of talk and nothing getting done”. Terry was confident that Trump would cut taxes, bring jobs back and “make Washington work again”. Supporters voiced only one concern about the  : the possibility of 2012 Republicans nominee Mitt Romney joining the administration. Jacob Hicks, a student at the University of Cincinnati, said: “It's the one thing that is kind of upsetting me. ” Hicks's friend Justin, a student at the University of Northern Kentucky who declined to give his last name, echoed these concerns. “Mitt Romney is part of the establishment. He wants to take over Trump and thinks he is better than Trump. ” But Trump was more than willing to make big promises to his loyal supporters. “People are constantly telling me and telling you to reduce our expectations  —   those people are fools,” he said, adding: “Anything we now want for our country is possible. ”"
104320,153035,"Revealed: the new face of Neil Prakash, Australia's most wanted Isis member",Guardian,Martin Chulov,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/03/neil-prakash-new-images-isis-member-arrest-turkey-australia,"The first photographs have emerged of Australian senior Isis member, Neil Prakash, following his capture and imprisonment in Turkey. The photographs obtained by the Guardian show the accused terrorist with a face that has thinned noticeably since he appeared more than six months ago in publicity material as one of the extremist group's chief recruiters. Prakash, whom the Australian government believed had been killed in an airstrike in Iraq's second city, Mosul, in May, was arrested by Turkish border guards on 24 October, in the southern village of Inali, the Guardian has confirmed. At first, Australia's most wanted man claimed to be a Cambodian national named Piseth Doung. However, Turkish officials said they recognised Prakash's Australian accent and formally charged him with terrorism the following day. Since then, he has been held in a prison in southern Turkey, where officials from both the Turkish and Australian governments have interviewed him. Prakash featured prominently in propaganda videos exhorting Australians to join Isis  —   an ultra hardline group that proscribes as apostates anyone who does not share its hardline read of Islamic tenets. He was believed to have been killed during a   attack on central Mosul. At the time, Iraqi officials said Prakash had been in one of the city's banks, which Isis had commandeered and was using to sort cash to be distributed around its so called Caliphate. Prakash was one of three senior Australian members of the group who was thought to have been killed, alongside Mohammed Elomar and Khaled Sharrouf. Australian security officials believe dozens of Australians have been killed fighting in Iraq and Syria. After carving a swath of influence in both countries, Isis is now on the back foot militarily with a sustained   campaign of airstrikes and gains by forces on the ground shrinking the so called caliphate by more than 60% in the past year. The loss of territory has seen the group's command and control slowly disintegrate and led its leaders to focus more on controlling populations than geography. The switch in tactics has seen Isis send senior figures to Europe and beyond where they have been tasked with staging spectacular attacks like those seen in Paris and Brussels, as well as   strikes like the truck rampage in Nice. Prakash's reported demise in May was at the time heralded by the Australian government as a major victory against Isis. Australia's attorney general, George Brandis, said: “His death disrupts and degrades Isil's ability to recruit vulnerable people in our community to conduct terrorist acts. ” Prakash has been actively involved in attempts to compel Australians to fight overseas and encouraging individuals to carry out attacks on Australian soil. He entered Syria in 2013 and has featured prominently in propaganda material disseminated by Isis. The child of Cambodian and Fijian migrants, Prakash is originally from Melbourne. He converted to Islam in 2012, and attended the   Islamic centre. The centre came to public attention more recently after two    linked to the centre were charged with terrorism offences in 2015. It was subsequently closed. The Australian federal police issued a first instance arrest warrant for Prakash in August 2015. The warrant is still current, and Australia's justice minister, Michael Keenan, has announced that Australia has lodged a formal extradition request with Turkey. But it remains unclear how Turkish authorities will respond to the request. Prakash could also be charged with offences in Turkey, and local authorities may still seek to prosecute him there. Some defence experts have warned against extraditing Prakash, in part because it could lead to him becoming a “totem” for local extremists in Australia."
104383,153119,Concerned Mexicans find lost dog – but where is the outrage for missing people?,Guardian,David Agren,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/02/mexico-mika-lost-dog-viral-missing-people-twitter,"After an    dog named Mika escaped at Mexico City airport en route to Houston this week, her distraught owner posted a brief video on Twitter, calling on the airline she was traveling with to find her missing pet. The tearful plea touched a nerve: Pamela Álvarez's post was retweeted more than 20, 000 times, and the hashtags #Mika and #BuscandoaMika (Looking for Mika) trended on Mexican Twitter.  When the dog was found and reunited with its owner, the story trended again, and the airline turned the episode into a public relations win. But the incident has also prompted some to ask why  —   in a country where the disappearance of thousands of people often goes unremarked  —   there was such outrage over a missing dog. At least 25, 000 Mexicans have disappeared over the past 10 years, many of them caught up in the violence unleashed by the government's militarized crackdown on drug cartels and organized crime. State authorities and the media show little interest in most missing persons cases, and relatives of the disappeared are often obliged to search alone for their loved ones. After the outpouring of concern for the missing dog, Twitter users were quick to highlight the apparent double standard. “I wish the authorities searched for the more than 30, 000 disappeared like they did for #Mika, I wish the media gave that coverage,” read one tweet. “So much unity to find ‘Mika' but I don't see them joining to find the thousands of disappeared,” read another. Some asked the airline Interjet  —   which found Mika in the Mexico City airport  —   to started searching for the 43 teacher trainees who vanished without trace after they were attacked by police in 2014 and handed over to criminals.  Others called on the carrier to track down Javier Duarte, the   of Veracruz state who went on the run amid allegations of rampant corruption. Missing persons cases in Mexico often end in limbo: few victims are located, either dead or alive. Families of the disappeared also suffer additional stigma as authorities claim  —   without offering proof  —   that victims of violence were somehow complicit in crime. “Families and friends begin to withdraw,” said Blanca Martínez, director of the Fray Juan Larios human rights center in the northern city of Saltillo, which provides legal assistance to families of the missing. “[They think that] your loved one was likely involved in something they shouldn't have been involved in so I'll keep my distance. ”"
104705,153529,Trump supports Dakota pipeline – but claims it's not due to his investment in it,Guardian,Oliver Milman,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/02/donald-trump-dakota-access-pipeline-support-investment,"Trump has said he supports a controversial oil pipeline that runs next to a Native American reservation in North Dakota  —   a project that the   is personally invested in. A briefing from Trump's transition team said that the real estate magnate supports the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline and that his backing “has nothing to do with his personal investments and everything to do with promoting policies that benefit all Americans”. Financial disclosure forms released earlier this year show that Trump has a stake in Energy Transfer Partners, the   firm behind the pipeline, and Phillips 66, which will hold a share of the project once completed.  Trump's investment in Energy Transfer Partners dropped from between $500, 000 and $1m in 2015 to between $1, 500 and $50, 000 this year. His stake in Phillips 66, however, rose from between $50, 000 and $100, 000 last year to between $250, 000 and $500, 000 this year, according to the forms.  The financial relationship has run both ways. Kelcy Warren, chief executive of Energy Transfer Partners, gave $103, 000 to elect Trump and handed over a further $66, 800 to the Republican National Committee after the property developer secured the Republicans's presidential nomination.  However, Trump's transition team dismissed any conflict of interest. “Those making such a claim are only attempting to distract from the fact that   Trump has put forth serious policy proposals he plans to set in motion on day one,” said a briefing note that was sent to campaign supporters.  Mary Sweeters, a spokesperson for Greenpeace, said Trump's support showed that “crony capitalism will run his administration”. “This is the definition of corruption,” she said. “The president of the USA should not be trading favors with oil and gas corporations. Millions of people will lose access to a clean water supply, including the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, and the rest of America will face the impacts of catastrophic climate change from burning fossil fuels. ”  A protest camp has grown in North Dakota since April, amid fears that the $3. 8bn Dakota Access pipeline will threaten the water and cultural artifacts of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. The   pipeline will take oil from North Dakota's Bakken fields to a refinery in Illinois and will cross the Missouri river  —   the main source of water for the tribe.  The   protest has unified Native American tribes against the project, with repeated clashes between protesters and police. This week, North Dakota governor Jack Dalrymple ordered the immediate evacuation of the protest camp, amid accusations of police violence from the mass arrests and water cannon deployment that have echoes of the civil rights protests of the 1960s.  Obama has suggested that the pipeline be rerouted to allay the fears of tribes but Energy Transfer Partners has vowed to push ahead and has accused the federal government of imposing costly delays upon the project.  Trump has promised an “America first” energy policy that will attempt to boost domestic oil, coal and gas production. The   has already stated he wants to “lift the   roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects to move forward” including the Keystone pipeline, another controversial fossil fuel project. North Dakota senator John Hoeven, a Republican, said that he met with Trump and successfully urged him to support the Dakota Access pipeline. “Mr Trump expressed his support for the Dakota Access pipeline, which has met or exceeded all environmental standards set forth by four states and the Army Corps of Engineers,” Hoeven said. “Also, it is important to know that the new administration will work to help us grow and diversify our energy economy and build the energy infrastructure necessary to move it from where it is produced to where it is needed. The result will be more jobs, a more vibrant economy and affordable energy for the American people. ”"
105263,154280,"Facing my fear: to save my autistic son's future, I had to let him go",Guardian,Elayne Robertson Demby,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/02/autistic-son-let-him-go-facing-my-fear,"Watching the child you once cradled in your arms walk out the door and into their own life always fills a parent with a sense of terror and loss. You raise them as best you can and hope that the adult you created will succeed. When that child, however, will never truly be an adult in the typical sense of the word, it's more complicated.  Over 21 years ago, I gave birth to a beautiful,   baby boy. At first, all went well. Evan, my son, initially met all his developmental milestones. But then, at 18 months, I realized something was horribly wrong. While other children babbled, Evan was strangely silent. While other children played with each other, Evan played by himself, endlessly rolling toy cars back and forth. We started making the rounds to doctors, and, after many evaluations and tests, got the diagnosis. Evan was on the autistic spectrum. Initially we were told that it was doubtful he would speak, or be  . Despite the dire prognosis, I threw myself into “curing” my son. After years of therapists, and hard work, Evan had limited, basic speech, could dress and take care of his toileting needs.  Even with those gains, Evan never progressed mentally beyond toddlerhood. Physically, however, he continued to grow into an adult, eventually reaching 5ft10in. He weighs over 200 pounds. I began worrying about his future early on. I couldn't expect him to grow up and support himself. I also couldn't expect him to live without someone caring for him. I initially thought that relatives who loved him would be able to care for him should my husband and I become sick or die.  After my husband and I returned from trip to Ireland when Evan was 15, however, we knew that was not the case. We had left Evan with my mother. Within a day she realized she was not up to the task of caring for the very large,    toddler my son had become. Both of my sisters lived nearby, so every day they “passed” Evan between them, no one capable of caring for him for more than several hours at a time. After we learned what happened, I knew other arrangements were needed for Evan's future. I could not expect family members to take care of him  —   he needed professionals. To be honest, I was not sure either my husband or I could do it on our own either. I became increasingly nervous about Evan's future, and often found myself lying awake at night wondering what would become of him.  I threw myself into researching what the potential arrangements could be for an adult with autism and eventually realized that it would be best for him to go to a residential school out of state. We live in Connecticut, and if a child lives with his or her parents when they “graduate” from school at 21, then that child will not be eligible for an adult residential placement until there is an “emergency” (like both parents dying).  If a child like Evan was in an    residential school, however, they automatically qualify for residential funding from the state when they turn 21. I knew I had to send my child, who was still effectively a toddler, away for his own good. It was the hardest decision I ever made, and I had to convince my husband that it was the right one as well. Even after we decided what to do, making it happen was not easy. For him to go to an    residential school meant I had to get our local school district to agree, since they would be the ones actually paying for it. At over $200, 000 a year, it was not something the district wanted to do. We could not pay any of the cost, because that would disqualify Evan from receiving state funding when he turned 21. We commenced on a   legal battle with the school district. In the course of all that, I was diagnosed with breast cancer and could not meet all of Evan's needs when I myself was sick. My cancer was caught early, and my treatment was not overwhelmingly invasive, but it was enough to make me realize that I would not always be in perfect health. Evan needed the care of someone who was. I redoubled my efforts to place him in a residential    school, eventually gaining him a placement in NY when he was 17.  Evan, now 21, lives in a   group home 40 minutes away from our home. He has friends  —   a social life with peers that are like him, something he did not have at home. Most importantly, Evan is now somewhere that, should I die or become ill again, he will always be cared for. Giving up a child is the hardest thing for a mother to do, but it was the only way to ensure his future."
105528,155864,"Andrew Sachs, Manuel from Fawlty Towers, dies aged 86",Guardian,Matthew Weaver,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/01/andrew-sachs-dies-after-alzheimers-aged-86,"Andrew Sachs, the actor best known for playing Manuel the bemused Spanish waiter abused by John Cleese's bullying hotelier in the BBC comedy series Fawlty Towers, has died aged 86. Cleese led tributes to his   describing him as a “brilliant farceur” and a “sweet, sweet man”. Sachs's wife, Melody Lang, revealed that he died in a care home last week after suffering from vascular dementia for four years. “My heart has been broken every day for a long time,” she said, explaining that she had collapsed while caring for her husband. Nevertheless, she said they were happy, adding that she “never once heard him grumble”. Sachs, whose father was a Jewish insurance broker, was born in Berlin before his family fled the Nazis to settle in Britain.  He became a household name in Britain as the hapless Manuel in the 1970s sitcom. Worried that he could not do a Spanish accent, Sachs initially wanted to play the role as a German.  But Cleese, who played Basil Fawlty, insisted that the character should be Spanish. He said despite his anxiety Sachs took to the role instantly.  Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Cleese said: “If you met him you would never think for a moment that he was a comedian, you would think he was a rather cultivated bank manager possibly retired, because he was quite quiet and poised and thoughtful. And then you stuck that moustache on him and he turned into a completely different human being. He was wonderful. ” He added: “He is one of the easiest to work with. Not just in the sense that he was totally agreeable  —   he was a very nice sweet man  —   but he was just a brilliant farceur. It was so easy for us to work out all the physical business. Farce is the hardest form of acting. ” Sachs tried to persuade Cleese to stop short of physical violence during rehearsals and the scenes. But he still ended up being frequently hit, often with spoons. He also suffered acid burns from chemicals used to produced smoke in a memorable scene when Manuel's white waiter's jacket caught fire in the Fawlty Towers kitchen.  Speaking of his   chemistry with Sachs, Cleese said: “It's like playing tennis with someone who is exactly as good as you are. And you play with them every week, sometimes he wins and sometimes you win, but somehow there is a rapport. It comes from the very deepest part of ourselves. We never had to work at it, it all happened so easily. ” He said his favourite scene with Sachs was when Manuel and Basil tried to hide a dead hotel guest in a laundry basket.  He said: “I think that was some of our very best physical comedy. Working out all that stuff about getting the body into the basket and then getting it out again. That was so much fun. ” Cleese said he was aware that Sachs had dementia. “I met him about eight or nine months ago. I realised then that although he was there, a very quiet sweet presence, he obviously wasn't totally present. ” He added: “Very sad. He was a sweet, sweet man. And it's still a little bit of shock, because, although I knew his memory was not so good, he was very special. ”  Earlier, Cleese tweeted a series of tributes to Sachs.  The director of BBC content, Charlotte Moore, also paid tribute to the “wonderful actor”. She added: “He will be fondly remembered for his many appearances across television and radio, not least for making the nation laugh in the classic role of Manuel. He entertained millions across a brilliant career and will be greatly missed. ” Speaking to the Daily Mail, Lang said her husband was diagnosed with vascular dementia in 2012. The condition left him in a wheelchair and unable to speak. “It wasn't all doom and gloom,” she said. “He still worked for two years. We were happy, we were always laughing, we never had a dull moment. He had dementia for four years and we didn't really notice it at first until the memory started going. “It didn't get really bad until quite near the end. I nursed Andrew, I was there for every moment of it. Dementia is the most awful illness. It sneaks in in the night, when you least expect it. It took a long time for Andy's brain to go. Even about a month before he died, he was sitting in the garden and chatting away. ” She added: “Don't feel sorry for me because I had the best life with him. I had the best husband and we really loved each other . .. We were married for 57 years, we loved each other very deeply and it was a pleasure looking after him. I miss him terribly. ” She said her husband died on 23 November and his family and friends attended his funeral on Wednesday. And she paid tribute to her husband, saying he was a “very handsome guy” who “always looked gorgeous”. She added: “Everybody says it but it's true, he's one of the nicest people I've met in my entire life. He's loved and respected and the public adore him. ” He would go on to play Ramsay Clegg in Coronation Street in 2009  —   a year after the scandal in which Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand left the BBC after a prank call to him on the radio about his granddaughter. But he slipped from public life as his illness took hold. Blackadder actor and comedian Sir Tony Robinson paid tribute to his “true friend”.  Samuel West, whose mother, Prunella Scales, starred alongside Sachs in Fawlty Towers, added: “Creator of one of our most beloved EU migrants. Such warmth and wit impossible to think of him without smiling. ” The comedy writer and director Edgar Wright said Sachs “spun comic gold as Manuel in Fawlty Towers”. The Jewish group Jewish Voice criticised the Daily Mail for putting a picture of Andrew Sachs on its front page next to its lead story about a rise in migrant numbers. It tweeted: "
105653,156033,"Mummified knees are Queen Nefertari's, archaeologists conclude",Guardian,Nicola Davis,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/dec/02/mummified-knees-are-queen-nefertaris-archaeologists-conclude,"A pair of mummified knees found in a tomb in Egypt's Valley of the Queens are most likely those of Queen Nefertari, the royal spouse of Pharaoh Ramses II, say archaeologists. Thought to have died around 1250 BC, Nefertari was the favourite consort of Ramses the Great, and was famed at the time for her beauty. “[Her] main role [was] to be the decorative bystander when Ramses was flexing his pharaonic muscles at public events, and she was there as the eye candy,” said Joann Fletcher from the University of York, a   of the research published in the journal PlosOne. “But really, [she was] a striking woman who I think exerted a quiet power behind the throne. ” Nefertari's lavish tomb was discovered in 1904  —   the walls covered in beautiful paintings, although the tomb itself had been looted long before. But it was unclear whether the fragmented, mummified legs discovered among the remaining contents did indeed belong to the queen. “There is a long, long history certainly in that part of Egypt around the Valley of the Queens, the Valley of the Kings and the nobles' tombs   you have repeated reuse of many burial sites, so lots of tombs were reused in later times,” said Fletcher. “You have got the effects also of very occasional but dramatic flash floods, when all sorts of material can be washed into tombs  —   so while things are found in a tomb it doesn't necessarily follow that the human remains that you are finding are those of the individual portrayed in there and on the tomb walls. ” In an attempt to resolve the question, Fletcher and an international team of researchers carried out a host of tests on the remains —   currently housed in the Egyptian museum in Turin, Italy  —   including radiocarbon dating,   of the legs, comparison of the knees with ancient and modern samples, and an investigation of the chemistry of the embalming agents. “Having studied the woman, and having looked as so many images of her beautiful face, I think there is a sense of immense irony that physically this is what we have got,” said Fletcher. “She has been reduced to knees. But because we don't give up  —   it's like: ‘we have got the knees, well, let's do what we can with them. '” The results reveal that remains belong to a woman probably aged around 40 to 50 years, who appears to have had a high social status. “The expertise that had gone into that mummification  —   even judging from the legs  —   the care, the attention, the wrapping, the materials employed they are strongly suggestive someone of incredibly high status,” said Fletcher. Together with the chemistry of the embalming agents, and analysis of various objects found in the tomb, the authors say the evidence suggests the knees are indeed those of Nefertari.   But not everyone is bowled over by the conclusion. As Christopher Eyre, professor of Egyptology at the University of Liverpool points out, no information could be gleaned from the team's ancient DNA analysis, comparisons to other knees can be problematic and, in any case, the knees were largely assumed to belong to Nefertari.  “This is an extremely interesting scientific analysis, but in the end it doesn't add anything to our assumptions before we started,” he said."
105712,156117,Even in the tough times Fidel Castro's Cuba placed great value on sport,Guardian,Richard Williams,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/dec/02/fidel-castro-cuba-value-sport-health-pride-boxing-baseball,"On a warm evening in a Barcelona suburb 24 years ago, the air thick and heavy, the   and gold, Cuba and the USA met in a baseball game that was as much a contest of ideologies as an Olympic  . As the two teams lined up to shake hands before the   each Cuban presented his opponent with a commemorative pennant. The Americans had come  . The USA team consisted of college boys, some of them on the brink of Major  . The Cubans were veterans of their domestic league, unbeaten in almost 70 internationals. After a scoreless first hour, it was barely a contest. In the fourth inning, in front of 7, 000 spectators, Orestes Kindelán smashed a pitch from Ricky Helling over the   wall for a   home run that began a cruise to a   victory. Helling, a Stanford University student, was on his way to a professional career that would reach its climax when he helped pitch the Florida Marlins to a World Series title in 2003. On the way he dropped the “y” and became Rick, while picking up a large amount in salary. Kindelán's homer was one of the 487 that made him Cuba's most prolific hitter. He would win three Olympic medals, two gold and one silver at the 1996 tournament, as he and his team proceeded to a second triumph, he hit nine home runs in nine games. In 2000, the year the USA finally pipped Cuba to the top step of the podium, his cousin, the lightweight boxer Mario Kindelán, won the first of two gold medals, before going on to beat Amir Khan of Britain in the 2004 final in Athens. The    Khan was one of four future world professional champions  —   the others were Félix Trinidad, Miguel Cotto and Andreas Kotelnik  —   whom Kindelán would beat during their amateur days. Like the heavyweights Teófilo Stevenson and Félix Savón, each a   Olympic champion, he became a legend at home. Baseball and boxing were two of the principal sports that provided a stage for the sporting heroes of Fidel Castro's Cuba. To beat the USA at baseball represented a big statement at a time when the Yanqui economic blockade was still in force. Those 73 boxing medals  —   37 of them gold  —   constituted another. Long before the singers and musicians of the Buena Vista Social Club beguiled audiences around the world, the sporting heroes of revolutionary Cuba enjoyed global renown. Barely six months after Castro's guerrillas marched into Havana, a   team set off for the 1960 Olympics in Rome. Enrique Figuerola finished fourth in the 100m and four years later he became the first   Cuban male to win a medal when he took the silver behind Bob Hayes in Tokyo. At Mexico City in 1968 Cuba's women won their first medal with a 4x100m silver behind the Tennessee Tigerbelles. The first gold medals came in the 1972 boxing tournament, for Stevenson at heavyweight, Emilio Correa Sr at welterweight and Orlando Martínez at bantamweight. The first gold for a female was secured in the 1980 javelin competition by María Caridad Colón, also the first   athlete of either sex to win an Olympic throwing event. Stevenson was the first   for Cuban sport. He was as handsome as Muhammad Ali and a couple of inches taller at 6ft 5in, and like the American he took his first Olympic title at an early age (Ali was 18 and Stevenson 20). What a   it would have made, had they not been born 10 years apart. Turning down a fortune offered by American promoters for just such a fight, he said: “What is a million dollars compared to the love of eight million Cubans?” Castro's regime fell short of perfection in many important respects, but no Cuban athlete ever needed to stage a podium protest to highlight discrimination on grounds of colour in his home country. Stevenson visited Ali in the US in 1995, and repaid the hospitality the following year. In Havana, already muted by Parkinson's disease, Ali presented Castro with a framed photograph of himself and Malcolm X walking along a Harlem street in 1963, a time when the boxer and the Cuban leader were both in their prime: Castro with the Bay of Pigs victory and the missile crisis behind him, and Ali looking ahead to the first Liston fight. Alberto Juantorena, the man with the 9ft stride, burst into the spotlight in 1976 to take the 400m and 800m gold medals in Montreal, and later became Cuba's vice sports minister. Anier García and Dayron Robles in the 110m hurdles, Javier Sotomayor in the high jump and Iván Pedroso in the long jump, Yumileidi Cumbá in the shot put, Maritza Martén in the discus, Osleidys Menéndez in the javelin, and a whole bunch of   wrestlers, pistol shooters, judokas, Taekwondo exponents and, of course, boxers also brought gold. And no list would be complete without Ana Fidelia Quirot, the 800m runner   after El Comandante en Jefe. Having missed the 1984 and 1988 Games through boycotts, she took the bronze in 1992, a year after winning the first of her three world championship medals. She returned to take the silver in 1996, having undergone 21 operations to treat the   burns that covered 38% of her body when a kerosene heater exploded as she washed clothes while seven months pregnant with a daughter who died days after an induced birth. Some athletes felt compelled to escape the world Castro had made. Dozens of baseball players went on to make their livings with Major League clubs, none more lucratively than Rusney Castillo, who signed a   contract with the Boston Red Sox worth $72. 5m in 2014. The boxer Guillermo Rigondeaux won two Olympic gold medals at bantamweight before defecting in 2007, turning pro and becoming the world   champion. Maybe, as the writer Jeré Longman suggested in the NY Times this week, Castro was never quite as much of a baseball fan (or player) as the propaganda suggested. Perhaps he really preferred basketball and soccer. But the many athletes who chose not to defect knew that they were benefitting from his belief that sport and exercise in general were good for the nation's health as well as its pride, even when times became tough and the swimming pools were drained and the floodlights switched off to save power. And there was, so far as I can discover, never a hint of the sort of organised doping programmes that other regimes, including those friendly to Cuba, developed to boost their illusory prestige."
105762,156194,Smith & Wesson profits jumped almost 50% after Orlando and Dallas shootings,Guardian,Jana Kasperkevic,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/smith-and-wesson-guns-profit-orlando-dallas-shootings,"Another quarter, another shooting, another boost in profits. America's second largest gunmaker posted a 49% jump in profits on Thursday, for the three months ending 31 July. Smith  Wesson's latest quarterly profits totaled $87. 6m, up from $58. 9m for the same period a year ago, the company announced on Thursday. The sales boost came in a period that included two of America's worst mass shootings, the Orlando nightclub shootings in June and the Dallas police shootings in July. “We are very pleased with our   results, which exceeded our financial guidance. We believe that higher revenue was driven by strong consumer demand as reflected in adjusted background checks from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) as well as our own market share gains,” James Debney, Smith  Wesson president and chief executive officer, said in a statement.  Nearly 2. 2m firearms background checks were processed this July, up from 1, 600, 832 last year. After those figures were reported on 1 August, Smith  Wesson shares surged and were trading at $30. 59 a share. The stock closed that day at an   high of $30. 36. As of Thursday, the NICS has yet to report the number of background check processed in August.  Background checks are not the most accurate way to predict sales as some checks do not result in sales and multiple firearms can be purchased with one background check. However, the metric is used to gauge the demand in the sector. The spike in demand driving up the value of gunmakers' stock has been attributed to increased calls for gun control regulations following a series of mass shootings. The news comes just months after the company announced $293. 8m in profits for its last fiscal year, a 50% increase on the year prior. Just before Smith  Wesson announced its total earnings for 2016, 49 people were killed at a gay club in Orlando. Not even a month later, five police officers were killed and seven were injured in shooting in Dallas. Gunmakers' stocks surged following both shootings. When speaking with investors in June, Debney said it was too early to tell if the Orlando shooting would have any impact on the sales of its firearms. The company's guidance for this quarter did not include a jump in demand.  Net sales for the quarter were $207m compared with $147. 8m for the first quarter last year, an increase of 40. 1%. This is Smith  Wesson's first quarterly report since it acquired Crimson Trace, which specializes in laser sighting systems, and Taylor Brands, a designer and distributor of knives. At the beginning of 2016, the company announced that it was looking to expand into the outdoor sporting goods market so as to not be   on the volatile demand for guns. The expansion plan announced in January could take up to five years to execute. With these acquisitions, Smith  Wesson is on the way to “become a leader in the market for shooting, hunting and rugged outdoor enthusiasts” Debney said. Considering the acquisitions and the strong performance in the first quarter, the company has revised its outlook and raised its full year revenue and net income guidance. "
105841,156300,Stars and stripes? Whatever: six times artists subverted the American flag,Guardian,Murray Whyte,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/dec/02/artists-american-flag-jasper-johns-dread-scott,"In a now famous tweet revealing, yet again, his tenuous grasp on the US constitution, Trump suggested that anyone daring to burn a US flag should be stripped of their citizenship. Never mind that the US supreme court ruled on that very act in 1989, deeming it protected free expression under the first amendment (see Dread Scott, below)   Old Glory as a symbolic vehicle for the full breadth of interpretation of American identity has been a strategy of artists and activists alike for decades. What follows are some of the best known and most relevant displays for this badly strained moment for the American psyche. When Scott showed this piece at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1989, it became a predictable flashpoint for conservative scorn. Its timing was impeccable: Congress, then in the grip of a Republican presidency and majority, had just passed   legislation protecting the flag, and Senator Bob Dole invoked it as a way to remove Scott's work from public view. (President George HW Bush, for his part, called it “disgraceful”.) The law led to Scott, along with three other protesters, burning the flag on the steps of Congress that same year, followed by a landmark in freedom of expression: the supreme court ruled that the first amendment protected the right of anyone to reinterpret the flag as they chose. So what was all the fuss about? Scott, an African American then in his early 20s, installed an array of photos culled from media  —   Korean students burning US flags   coffins of American soldiers  —   with a suggestion book, of sorts, asking his titular question. While offering their views, the audience would have to use the flag, laid on the floor, as a kind of doormat. At the tail end of the jingoistic Reagan years, Scott's simple, if provocative, question touched a raw nerve in the American psyche  —   one that   Trump seems determined to tear open again. Made partly to mark the election of David Dinkins, NY City's first  —   and only  —   black mayor, in 1990, Hammons' reimagination of Old Glory can be seen as cheeky celebration of an undeniable moment of American progress. Its red, black and green stand for the blood and skin of African Americans, and a nod to the verdant roots of black civilization in Africa.  Folded into Hammons'   interest in civil rights and black power movements, you can draw a straight line from then to an increasingly unstable now: Black Lives Matter has prompted the   to muse openly about investigating the movement as a domestic terror organization, and shifts Hammons' guardedly hopeful work into a symbol of deepening division  —   of two Americas at the very least, and probably more. Kruger, whose wryly blunt   work pioneered media appropriation in the 70s and 80s  —   it borrowed, while gleefully satirizing, the language of popular advertising  —   has always been a firebrand of politically engaged   most often with an acid,   wit.  This work takes a foundational symbol of jingoistic Americana and deeply complicates it with questions of power and powerlessness in a polarized nation. Coming out of the   years, where many believed power given to a cadre of elites was gleefully abused with the blessing of a willfully ignorant public, the questions were apt as   Trump assembles his cabinet along similar lines, Kruger's exploration could hardly be more relevant. Made after many fractious years of the civil rights movement, Ringgold's piece leaves little to the imagination. “It would be impossible for me to picture the American flag just as a flag, as if that is the whole story,” she said at the time. “I need to communicate my relationship with this flag based on my experience as a black woman in America. ”  The word “DIE” is clear enough behind the stars, but turn the image to the vertical to clarify: the stripes, emblems of the country's original 13 colonies, spell out “NIGGER” in blocky type.  After years of water cannons, church burnings, unprosecuted murders and widespread, often unchecked violence against black people, race relations in America were as raw as they had ever been. Ringgold has revisited the flag as a symbol of oppression in her 1997 work The Flag Is Bleeding, she recreated the flag with traditional African American quiltwork, sewing an image of a bloodied mother and children into the folksy motif. Johns, a painter whose work was foundational in the evolution of conceptualism, painted his first flag in 1954 while he was a    army veteran (he was discharged two years earlier). It's faithful, but notable for its obvious materiality, the crisp lines of the fabric rendered rough and homespun by the artist's hand. Johns himself never suggested specific intentions for his flag paintings, beyond the evolving conceptual priority on remaking everyday objects in unfamiliar ways.  That said, it has often been suggested that the artist's return to symbol at important junctures in American political life (the Joseph   inquiry into “ ” or communist, activity the Vietnam war) reflect a nation's foundational ideal beaten down by wrongheaded political action. Looking at another flag, made in 1955, it's not hard to read that much: it's rough and textural, and a grimy white. Longo rose to prominence during the “pictures generation” of the 1980s with a series of photographs called Men in the Cities, which showed men (and women) snappily clad in business attire and tangled in   contortions, as though having just been shot.  Longo's engagement with the darkness that lies just beneath the slick surface of American idealism projects right up to the present day: a 2014 show at NY's Metro Pictures coupled Longo's   black and white facsimiles of abstract expressionist masterpieces with an imposing sculptural treatment of the American flag: an enormous, rough presence in glistening black, the piece cantilevered awkwardly in the gallery space, listing badly, as though it were a ship going down.  It makes for an elegantly powerful read: a cultural totem for the   “American century” Longo's treatment of those masters deflates ambitions of ever achieving such heights again, while the flag work  —   called Untitled (The Pequod) after Captain Ahab's mercilessly violent, famously doomed whaling ship in    —   evokes Jasper Johns, minus the ambiguity.  Longo suggests an America going in one direction: down. "
105945,156440,Tiger Woods rolls back the years with seven-under-par second round,Guardian,,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/02/tiger-woods-hero-world-challenge,"Tiger Woods delivered a hugely encouraging   performance at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas as his comeback continued on Friday. Returning after two back operations to play competitive golf for the first time since August 2015, the   major winner had a mixed first day, making a superb start before some   forced him to settle for a    73. Things went much more smoothly for Woods on Friday as he recorded seven birdies, including four in his last eight holes, in a   round of 65. At six under Woods moved up to joint eighth, six shots off the lead held by JB Holmes, who was yet to reach the halfway point of his second round. Woods' enjoyment was summed up by an enthusiastic fist pump after he sunk a long putt for par on the 16th, which he had   on Thursday. He also made par on the 18th having   that, too, a day earlier. The    former world No1, now ranked 898th, told Sky Sports: “It feels good. “Yesterday I had it going for three holes (he hit three successive birdies on the 6th, 7th and 8th) and I lost it and finished over par. “Today was different. I turned those two par fives (the 9th and 11th, both of which he bogeyed on Thursday) into under par and consequently I was able to play the middle part of the round better. “I kept the momentum going and moved myself up the board. ” Woods had started the day 17th on an   leaderboard, with only Justin Rose below him before the Olympic champion was forced to withdraw."
105984,156492,Hollande's re-election retreat receives mixed response in Europe,Guardian,Jon Henley,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/02/francois-hollande-france-president-re-election-retreat-mixed-response-europe,"François Hollande's decision not to stand for a second term, the first time since the war that a French president has not bid for   was greeted with a mixture of admiration and scorn by the country's neighbours  —   and stinging criticism of his record. In Germany, the Süddeutsche Zeitung argued that Hollande's defeat recalled the fate of two other social democratic “changers” Tony Blair and Gerhard Schröder, both of whom once pushed through painful structural changes that ran counter to their parties' instincts and were abandoned by voters as a consequence. “But Hollande's record is far more bitter,” the newspaper wrote. “He too had to put up with large swaths of the French left labelling him the Socialists' gravedigger, because of his neoliberal reforms. But he got nothing in return: France's economy failed to restart   …     and the unemployed remained on the streets. ” The conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said Hollande would leave behind a “field of leftwing destruction”. It added that he had “staged his abdication like a republican monarch” declaring he would “prefer to hand the history of France on to someone else”. In Switzerland, Le Temps was kinder, saying the embattled Hollande had opted to “abdicate with dignity” aware of the risks a second candidacy would have posed to “French political debate, the left, and France's image in the world”.  The paper said Hollande's record low approval rating  —   4% in October  —   meant that a man who was determined on his election in 2012 to be a “normal” president had actually become “abnormal”. Ironically, it said, his decision “makes him more presidential than he ever was” as president.  Belgium's Le Soir said that after the primary defeats of   candidates Alain Juppé and Nicolas Sarkozy, Hollande was the third “dinosaur” of French politics to depart the scene in recent weeks, “symbol of a zeitgeist that wants change at all cost and rejects the current model, whatever it is”.  The president's decision not to stand was “without doubt the only honourable way out, in order to avoid an unprecedented defeat in the first round of the election or even in the   primary” the newspaper said. But it added that Hollande would leave behind “a mess”. The president who promised a France “less divided, on a path to economic recovery, made many mistakes. He has been a major disappointment. He accomplished a few, mainly social reforms  —   but he leaves a country on edge, and a left in tatters. ”"
106091,156634,Trump's billionaire cabinet could be the wealthiest administration ever,Guardian,David Smith,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/02/trumps-rich-pickings-president-elects-team-could-be-wealthiest-ever,"The appetisers were young garlic soup with thyme and sautéed frogs' legs, diver scallops with caramelized cauliflower and   emulsion. Trump ate a prime sirloin with citrus glazed carrots Mitt Romney chose lamb chops with a mushroom bolognese sauce. At   a   Michelin restaurant in the Trump International Hotel in NY, it's a rich man's world, and one where the US   feels at home. This has also been evident in his appointments so far, as the   “  billionaire” looks set to preside over the wealthiest administration in modern history. Trump, a former host of reality TV show The Apprentice, is surrounding himself with the 1%: billionaires and millionaires, investment bankers and venture capitalists, Wall Street insiders and family fortune heirs, many educated at elite schools. It is the most brazen embrace of big money since the 1980s era of Ronald Reagan, Tom Wolfe's Masters of the Universe and Oliver Stone's Gordon Gekko. “It is a throwback to the ‘greed is good' mentality,” said Marge Baker, executive   of the liberal pressure group People For the American Way. “It's also alarming that the   said he believes what's good for his business is good for America. That's not how you want the leader of your country to be making decisions. ” Baker added: “When you've got Wall Street billionaires setting the agenda it's not likely to benefit average Americans. Research shows that the wealthy have different priorities and policy priorities, for example on healthcare and the minimum wage. ” The Trump cabinet's emphasis on tax cuts and deregulation is also likely to echo the Reagan era. Election rival Clinton warned during the campaign: “Trump is trickledown economics over and over again. I called it   trickledown economics. ” Igor Volsky, deputy director of a   thinktank, the Center for American Progress Action Fund, said: “The same trickledown policies we saw in the 80s [that] didn't help ordinary Americans are going to be put forward again. If you look at large parts of the cabinet it does feel like going back in time. ” The very people who heard Trump's blunt, populist message about unrigging the system would be the ones to suffer its betrayal, Volsky added. “He's going to perpetuate a system that helps the very richest Americans at the cost of programmes that help middle and   Americans. ” Andrew Mellon, one of the richest Americans of the early 20th century, served as treasury secretary in three administrations. George W Bush's first cabinet was criticised for containing high rollers in 2001. But Trump has taken the mix of democracy and plutocracy to a whole new level.  The Politico website suggested the new president's team could be worth $35bn  —   some have made political donations worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The median household income in the US is about $55, 000.  Trump's supporters have said they welcome the fact he is a businessman, not a politician beholden to special interests, and hope he will run America like an efficient corporation. But several members of the administration could face accusations of a conflict of interest  —   that they are forming policy with at least one eye on their own businesses, or those of their cronies. Neil Sroka, spokesman for the liberal organisation Democracy for America, said: “You've got a group of entitled,    billionaires who are going to be bossed around by a bigoted,    billionaire. It is beyond credibility that they are going to be able to accurately reflect the needs of   citizens who rely on leaders in Washington to fight for them. ” The appointments were   Sroka added. “What this rogues' gallery of billionaires that Trump is trotting shows is that he isn't interested in protecting working people. He wants to curry favour with a millionaire and billionaire class that he's always sought the approval of. “This is a class that dines on lobster steak and caviar every night. They're not figuring out how to put food on the table. They're figuring out how to make a few more millions before they go home at night. ” Betsy DeVos, education secretary.    of Richard DeVos,   of marketing company Amway.

106102,156656,Leipzig flat made famous in Capa war photo becomes poignant memorial,Guardian,Kate Connolly,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/01/leipzig-flat-poignant-memorial-clean-beautiful-death-robert-capa-second-world-war,"Robert Capa called them his most definitive images of the second world war. Seconds after the photographer had taken a portrait of a   sergeant poised with a heavy machine gun on a Leipzig balcony, the soldier slumped to the floor. On 18 April 1945, in the final days of the conflict, he had been hit and killed by the bullets of a German sniper. Capa climbed through a balcony window into the flat to photograph the dead man, who lay in the open door, a looted Luftwaffe sheepskin helmet on his head. The subsequent series of photographs show the rapid spread of the soldier's blood across the parquet floor as other GIs attended to him and his fellow gunner took over his post at the machine gun. “It was a very clean, somehow very beautiful death and I think that's what I remember most from the war,” Capa recalled two years later in a radio interview.  The images were wired back to NY and featured prominently in Life magazine's Victory edition on 14 May. The soldier, Raymond J Bowman, 21, of Rochester, NY, was later hailed as The Last Man to Die by Capa and the photographs would become some of the most memorable images of the second world war. But their origins would have remained obscure had a group of Leipzigers interested in highlighting and preserving the city's   Capa connection not discovered that a derelict   apartment block was where the photographer, embedded with the US army during the capture of the city, had taken the pictures. Learning that the building was destined for demolition four years ago, the group set about trying to save it. And save it they have: following a €10. 5m (£9m) refurbishment, including shoring up the foundations and replacing the balconies, the Capa Haus has been restored to its former glory.  Strips of Jahnallee have been renamed Bowman Strasse and Capa Strasse. In the elegant ground floor Cafe Eigler a permanent exhibition is dedicated to The Last Man series and other Capa pictures which tell the story of 18 April. “There was very little in the city to recall the last days of [the second world war],” said Meigl Hoffmann, “and we were struck by what a poignant and authentic memorial this actually was. ” Hoffman, 48, a Leipzig political cabaret artist and one of the founding members of the Capa Haus initiative, grew up with the many wartime stories of his parents and grandparents. But the US army's role in liberating Leipzig from nazism had been an unfashionable version of events during the days of communism when the dominant story was of how the Red Army  —   which arrived in July  —   had saved his city.  “As a result the Capa connection had been suppressed because his pictures told the unfavourable story of the US troops, and so for years no one here really knew about them, they were considered subversive,” said Hoffmann.  He discovered the Last Man to Die images in a banned underground magazine at the age of 19. “I was electrified by the pictures  —   they appeared 3D to me, and because a lot of the photos we knew in the East German era were in black and white, they struck me as being very contemporary,” Hoffmann explained. He and a friend set about trying to locate the balcony, aided by Capa's description of the “big apartment building that overlooked the bridge” on which German soldiers “were putting up considerable resistance” as well as visual references in the photograph itself. “But the only building that matched the description didn't seem to fit at all, as it had no balcony,” said Hoffmann. The place he found  —   Jahnallee 61  —   was on a busy crossroads in the west of the city. He clambered with trepidation through its broken ceilings and floorboards, finding the “nice bourgeois apartment” on the second floor as Capa had described it, a shell of its former self.  But, surprisingly, unlike the rest of the building, it was largely intact  —   apart from the fact that its balcony, close to collapse, had been removed years before  —   and it still had the commanding, unobstructed view of the Zeppelin Bridge. With weeks to go before the wrecking ball was due to knock it down, the initiative contacted US war veterans involved in the battle for Leipzig.  Bowman, the fifth of seven children, had been sent to Europe with Company D of the 23rd Infantry Regiment of the 2nd Infantry Division. He was taking it in turns with his fellow gunner, Lehman Riggs, 24, to operate the . 30 calibre Browning. Riggs had just stepped back inside the apartment and was reloading the gun as the fatal bullet struck. The grandfather clock behind which Riggs took shelter showed  —   in brighter exposures of the photographs  —   that Bowman died at 3. 15pm. Riggs, now 96 and living in Cookeville, Tennessee, said his memories of the incident had rushed back during a recent return visit to the apartment.  “The event had so disturbed my mind because of the loss of my buddy, I had tried to block it, and hadn't talked about it for years,” the retired postal worker said. “But returning to the scene unlocked all the memories. ” He recalled Bowman as a “very kind young man”. “I was 3ft from him when it happened. I could have reached out and touched him, but I knew he was dead. I had to carry on in his place, as I'd been trained to do. ” Events had happened so fast, he said, from the order to “run into an upper floor of the house and offer cover for our troops so they could come across the bridge” to the death of his partner, that he had been unaware of Capa's presence.  “In combat we often had army photographers with us. I thought he was just another one of those. ”  He contacted his wife to buy Life magazine on learning that he featured in it, but described it as “extremely painful” to view the pictures once he returned from the war, “as they made me vividly relive what had happened”. Robert Petzold, from Leipzig, who was 13 at the time, recalled the phone call he received from his grandmother the previous evening. “She lived a few kilometres further west and had seen that the Americans were arriving in Leipzig,” he said.  “She told us: ‘The enemy is coming, have a hearty breakfast. '”After doing just that, he, his mother and sister took cover in the air raid shelter in the basement and, while they could hear the heavy exchange of fire, they had little inkling of the drama that had unfolded on the balcony where, Petzold recalled, “I used to keep rabbits. ” Once they were given the   his mother returned to their flat to the horrifying scene of the dead soldier in her living room. “His blood was all over the floor, and soaked into a rug. On a dresser in the hallway she found letters and photographs that had been removed from his pocket, showing a woman and children. She said: ‘They may be our enemies, but they suffer the same fate as us,'” Petzold said. For years, he said, his mother tried in vain to remove the blood stains from the rug. “But nothing, no chemical process, could get rid of them  —   they served to us as a permanent reminder of the horror of what had happened. ”  A dining room table in an adjoining room that was used by other members of the machine gun platoon had dents on its underside from the recoil motion of the gun. “The soldiers had been thoughtful enough to turn the table top upside down to avoid damaging it. My mother was always very impressed by that,” he recalled. Raymond Bowman's mother, Florence, at first refused to believe reports her son had died. When her other son contacted Bowman's army unit for further confirmation, he was told to buy a copy of Life. There the family recognised the pin with the initials RB, which Bowman had made in high school. The Capa Haus initiative, which was accompanied by personal appeals to city authorities by Riggs, Petzold and members of the Bowman family to save the historic site, led to approaches by a Munich investor, who prides himself on his track record of saving historic buildings that “tell stories”.    “It was an important picture but one that Capa almost didn't take,” said Christoph Kaufmann, of Leipzig's Civic History Museum and the main curator of the exhibition, pointing to Capa's own take on the incident, in the only known recording of the photographer's strong   voice. “He'd just moved on to the open balcony and put up that heavy machine gun,” Capa said. “But God, the war was over, who wanted to see one more picture of somebody shooting?   …     But he looked so   and he was one of the men who looked like if it would be the first day of the war he still was earnest about it   …     So I said: ‘All right, this will be my last picture of war.' And I put my camera and took a portrait shot of him. ” Katrin Stein now lives in the apartment, her balcony painted   and adorned with geraniums and a wash stand.  “I try not to think too much about what happened here,” she said, standing in the balcony doorway where Bowman fell. “But it certainly adds another dimension to the history I learned in school. ” "
106212,156818,Kevin Smith and the triumph of commerce over art,Guardian,Dave Schilling,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/01/kevin-smith-mallrats-clerks-critical-success-failure,"Do not pity Kevin Smith. Ignore your initial instinct to feel sorry for the   of Yoga Hosers, a film about teenage convenience store workers who fight monstrous talking Aryan sausages bent on world domination, which Rotten Tomatoes' critical consensus describes as “undisciplined, unfunny, and bereft of evident purpose”. The critical drubbing that accompanies the release of a Kevin Smith film is almost de rigueur now, but there was a time when Smith had something resembling cultural cachet. In 2016, he's a carnival barker for an increasingly small audience. Yoga Hosers will certainly not be challenging any box office records this weekend, but that doesn't seem to be the point. The director who burst on the scene with the borderline transgressive    cult classic Clerks is less an auteur and more a brand  —   a lesser Chris Hardwick, shilling   and oversized hockey jerseys. Is that such a tragic fate, though? The current cinematic landscape is littered with   Soderberghs and Spielbergs who burn brightly at the start of their careers and find themselves crashing against the gates of studio after studio. The fate of Josh Trank, who hit big with Chronicle and fell back to earth when he directed the latest Fantastic Four film, is well on its way to a place in Hollywood's pantheon of cautionary tales. Cop Car director Jon Watts was plucked from obscurity by Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures to direct the next   reboot.  The shortlist of directors being considered for the Captain Marvel movie is mostly unknowns. These people could either end up blackballing themselves like Trank or hitting the jackpot like Jurassic World director Colin Trevorrow. Such is the nature of the modern film industry  —   there's no room for minor successes. But when Kevin Smith went from Jersey wunderkind to Hollywood made man, indie directors could comfortably ply their trade making   pictures designed for niche audiences. Smith's first studio film, Mallrats, was engineered to appeal to the teen audience the industry craves. Beverly Hills 90210 star Shannon Doherty was recruited to star and the soundtrack was loaded with popular bands of the time such as Bush and Elastica. It was a major departure from Clerks, with its grimy settings and amateur actors. Clerks was closer to a 1970s downtown NY art film than anything resembling a mainstream commercial product. It documented the    disappointments of    life in a small town. Mallrats, on the other hand, featured Smith as his   Silent Bob, flying around a set, and a scene where a man eats pretzels covered in human excrement. Chasing Amy, a modest film about sexual politics and identity, saved Smith from the scrapheap, but it cemented the cult of personality around him. He had opened comic book shops in New Jersey and Los Angeles called Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash. In these stores, he sold not only comics but also merchandise from his films. If you fancied the beanie Jason Mewes wore in Dogma, you could buy it. Want a Clerks action figure? It's there too. What Smith knew, which he probably sussed out from the merchandising success of Spike Lee years earlier, was that the film is less important than the intellectual property and the fanbase that will gladly hand over their money for the right to own a piece of it. To this day, Smith still hucks swag from all his various ventures, many of them unrelated to  . He does podcasts, performs standup comedy and stars in reality shows. After horrible failures such as Jersey Girl and Cop Out, Smith retreated from Hollywood  —   not only because he had to, but because he could. His loyal fans, willing to follow him anywhere he commands, fund his work. He comes from a time when a director could develop as a singular, unique voice that had his or her own audience. Quentin Tarantino is the purest expression of that iconoclastic position  —   he makes Quentin Tarantino movies and that's it, movie business trends be damned.  Kevin Smith also only makes Kevin Smith movies, but unlike Tarantino, mainstream audiences have next to no interest in what he does. It's easy to malign someone like Smith for his seeming lack of interest in the art form. By the time of the   Clerks II, most of the critics who initial anointed him a darling of the medium had turned on him, relegating him to the cultural scrapheap. But as they were doing that, he was furthering his connection to his fanbase. He doesn't need film critics, and yet they persist in cutting him down. What Smith has done is render himself  . The wall between him and the naysayers is so tall and so thick that nothing they say can penetrate it. Smith has promised to retire from   and reneged on that promise, defiant to the last. If there is one constant in his career, it's a marked lack of interest in servicing anyone's taste but his own. In the process, he's made himself a very rich man and a brand with few equals, but that's the greatest wedge between him and the average film critic. His bad movies are almost beside the point. They are merely advertisements for Kevin Smith Incorporated, an ongoing business concern that will exist long after we're gone. It is a grand triumph of commerce over art  —   the huckster's dream realized."
106365,157023,Rogue One: could Disney want to cap the success of Star Wars spin-off?,Guardian,Catherine Shoard,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/02/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-does-disney-want-to-cap-success,"With a fortnight still to go before its release, Rogue One is nonetheless set to be 2016's   film. The first “anthology” movie in the Star Wars franchise, it is set in roughly the same universe as episodes one to seven, but features none of the familiar characters. Its cast is more credible than  : Felicity Jones, Ben Mendelsohn, Riz Ahmed, Diego Luna. Likewise, its British director, Gareth Edwards. Yet such is the strength of George Lucas's space saga brand, acquired by Disney for $4. 05bn in 2012, that earlier this week, Rogue One broke presale ticket records for the year. Pundits predict a final global total of $1. 4bn.  But these figures may mask a slightly different story. Although three films (Finding Dory, Captain America: Civil War and Zootropolis) have already tipped the billion dollar mark in 2016, the market is perceived to be down, making topping the charts less of a challenge. And although impressive, Rogue One's presales pale in comparison to those for last December's Star Wars: A Force Awakens, which went on to make $2. 1bn. Rumbling concerns around the film began in August, with word that Edwards had taken a backseat while   Tony Gilroy reshot, according to some quotes, around 40% of the film. Insiders insisted Gilroy's role was mostly in   yet on Wednesday it was reported that his fee had risen from around $200, 000 to more than $5m, fuelling further speculation that Disney's issues with the original cut had been considerable. “It does sound a little bit unusual,” says Bruce Nash, founder and publisher of box office analysis site The Numbers. While rival studio Marvel now builds two weeks of reshoots into its schedule as standard, and successful blockbusters such as Titanic and Back to the Future were changed considerably, these changes are generally to address casting concerns or redo an ending, rather than something as fundamental as the director.  But the real reason may not be so straightforward as the studio being keen to improve a movie in which they had already invested $200m. For while Disney would naturally seek to maximise profits on the film, it would not do so at the expense of its core product: the Skywalker saga. “It's an interesting decision for Disney,” says Nash. “They want to reinforce the franchise, and they probably don't want to cloud the waters. ” Earlier this week, Edwards confirmed that Rogue One will not have the iconic opening text “crawl” so synonymous with the series, while producer Kathleen Kennedy vowed that regardless of Rogue One's success, no sequel would be forthcoming. Its function, then, is as much to keep the series in public consciousness and maintain momentum for next Christmas's Episode VIII as it is to stand on its own feet.  “Disney would have been looking at the film through two lenses,” says Nash. “How do we make a great film and how do we fit it into the overall mythology? They want the secondary films [a    movie is also on the way] to build into making the next main story even more interesting. ”  It's possible that Edwards, the man behind highly innovative   film Monsters, might in fact have made a movie so interesting it was actively distracting. Gilroy won acclaim for the George Clooney drama Michael Clayton, but his last film was the more generic The Bourne Legacy, whose tone may be more in keeping with what Disney desire.  It's momentum, too: while The Bourne Legacy took a healthy profit, it didn't make as much as the previous films, nor was it so critically successful as to steer the series down a path in which Jeremy Renner became the lead rather than Matt Damon. So the current   predictions for the film  —   mammoth yet not    —   could be good news for the studio. It may also have been cheered by the numbers for Warner Bros's Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: another series spun off from a beloved franchise. In the US, that film opened with just half of what the final Harry Potter film made  —   a ratio that would likely suit Disney.  Rogue One's final total will depend on its level of mainstream  . Says Nash: “Episode VII was a huge family gathering. I don't feel that's the case for Rogue One. Core movie fans are going to go out in droves but in order to hit the real heights you have to answer yes to the question: is grandma going to come see this film?” Making an event movie is great in theory. But you don't want it to upstage the main event.  •Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is released on 15 December in Australia and the UK, and on 16 December in the US."
106558,157295,Lady Leshurr: ‘They wanted to pit me against Nicki Minaj – I wasn't feeling that',Guardian,Alexis Petridis,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/01/lady-leshurr-they-wanted-to-pit-me-against-nicki-minaj-i-wasnt-feeling-that,"Lady Leshurr has just come back from the US. She has been spending a lot of time there this year, she says: “We've been to Atlanta, LA, New Orleans, Miami, NY. ” She played a   gig in the latter, the audience's enthusiasm apparently undimmed by the fact that she raps with a distinct Brummie twang: “I didn't think they'd be able to understand me, didn't think my accent, of all accents, would have crossed over like that. But they were singing my lyrics back at me. It was hilarious, hearing people with American accents saying ‘bredrin' and ‘wasteman' all that British urban slang. ” But mostly, she's been working on her debut album. “Working with a producer called Deputy, who made Rihanna's Bitch Better Have My Money Bangladesh, he made Lil' Wayne's A Milli, and Diva and Video Phone for Beyoncé. I've got a session with Scott Storch, he's coming back now as well. And you know Timbaland?” Timbaland, the celebrated, groundbreaking producer of Missy Elliott, Aaliyah, Justin Timberlake and Beyoncé? The visionary auteur behind more than 100 hit singles on both sides of the Atlantic? I'm aware of his work, yes. “Well, I've been doing a few bits with Timbaland. Timbaland is amazing. He just rang me up on my mobile one day. ” The girl born Melesha O'Garro giggles. “I'm just working with a few legendary producers. ” Here, should you want it, is empirical evidence of UK rap's sudden ascent to prominence in the US, a country traditionally resistant to the charms of the British MC, and, moreover, of the fact that a lot of people think Lady Leshurr is about to become very famous indeed. In fact, she's already famous  —   over the course of our interview outside of a north London wine bar, she's interrupted not once, not twice, but three times by fans. Her fame is largely thanks to a series of five freestyles called The Queen's Speech, which she released herself on iTunes and uploaded to YouTube, accompanied by   videos, becoming a viral sensation. Last August's Queen's Speech 4 racked up a fairly staggering 31m views. Their lyrics were both dextrous and extremely funny, a blur of highly original    —   “I'll upload a picture of your dog and sell it on Gumtree”  —   and   references they also frequently came equipped with the kind of hooklines you can imagine being chanted in playgrounds: “That's nasty, change your panties” “Brush your teeth” “Your lips look like crispy bacon”. Moreover, they seem to have attracted a different audience compared with other UK rappers. “I've seen videos of    women and men in America saying ‘Brush your teeth' and stuff, videos of a little baby watching it and laughing, do you know what I mean? I get parents saying to me: ‘Wow, you're the only artist I let my kids listen to,' because I don't swear in my lyrics. I just don't think it's necessary. My mum brought me up really well, I don't swear unless I'm really, really angry. “Everyone's too cool, everyone wants to be drinking alcohol in their videos and driving flash cars, wearing big chains. I don't want to do that, because I don't live that. All my music, you'll never see me with my breasts hanging out or showing so much flesh that you can't show it to your kids or things like that. Because, one, I respect myself as a person two, I want to make people understand that you don't have to go that route to be successful. If you've got the talent, let the talent talk. Look at what I'm wearing afterwards, if you have to, but listen to me first, do you know what I mean?” In person, Lady Leshurr is charismatic and funny and smart. You can see why her new major record label  —   she's signed to Sony's RCA imprint  —   might think she's a hot prospect in the past 12 months, she has gone from a hugely productive   cottage industry, of the kind that's fuelled grime's commercial resurgence in Britain, to an artist that Timbaland and co are queuing up to work with. “All these major established artists reaching out,” she frowns. “I had people like Akon calling my phone. Busta Rhymes. I've no idea how he even got my number. Young Money Records tried to reach out to sign me. ” She laughs again. “I'm saying it all like it's so casual, but it's just because I don't really let things excite me like that. I try to be calm with it. I'm not like: ‘Oh my God, oh my God. '” Perhaps that's something to do with the fact that she's been here, or at least somewhere like it, before. When the Observer profiled her, in 2013, her career appeared to be about to blast off: a major label had offered her a deal, her single Blazin' had just deposed Justin Timberlake from No 1 on the MTV Base chart, she was talking about launching a clothing line, Friggin' L, winningly named after one of her mixtapes. But then everything went wrong, of which more later. Or perhaps it's something to do with her background, which is substantially grimmer than the bubbly image she projects suggests. Before she became a rapper, she says, she started out writing poetry “because I wanted to express myself. I grew up in a very strict family. My father was very strict, very violent: he had been brought up in a violent background and it's probably just a cycle. But I think that was the push to try and express myself in another way. I couldn't really express myself to him or anybody else. I was very shy, always looked down, I'd never have any eye contact with people, so I put all that into poetry, writing down my frustration, what I felt and what I'd seen, or stuff written from my mum's view, as if I was my mother. I started thinking, ‘You know what? Why don't I just rap?' Because it's just poetry with a beat behind it, really. ” She learnt to “rap, produce, mix, master, everything” at a youth club across the road from her home in Solihull. “We would all be in one room with the mic, someone would be DJing, the lights would be off, it'd just be sweaty, loads of men. No other girls at all. At first, they were like: ‘She's good for a girl' or ‘Ah, she's sick because there's no other girls about'  —   there was always an excuse. So I thought: Fine, I'm going to show you that I'm better than the next man, not ‘good for a female'. So it pushed me to work hard, to write the best. ” She produced her first mixtape at 14: “I had no idea how to promote, or how to get my things in shops, so I just used to leave CDs on the bus when I was on my way to school. I'd hand them out to strangers, leave them on park benches, anywhere I thought people might see them and pick them up. ” Amazingly, it was a strategy that worked. Someone uploaded its contents to a website  —   “I can't even remember what it was called, but it was big for UK artists at the time and it got loads of hits”  —   but her burgeoning career was still hampered by her home life. “I wasn't allowed out of my area. I wasn't allowed to go anywhere my friends were allowed to go to. I was always told by my father: ‘No, you're not allowed to do this no, you're not going to make it.' There was a time when he sat all the brothers and sisters down in a room and he wrote down job professions and he put them in a hat and whatever we picked out, we had to be. So all my sisters are like nurses, carers, my brothers are carpenters, mechanics, but I wouldn't do it. I knew that if I picked what was in that hat, I'd have to start studying for it. Me and one brother who's now a footballer were the only ones stood up to him. It caused a whole heap of madness, and I just ran away for a couple of hours. He wasn't there when I got back, and from that point, I was just trying to dodge him. ” She left home after landing a role in a local film called One Day by rapping for the director. The film was withdrawn from cinemas  —   “It was about gangs in Birmingham and when they showed it in Birmingham both gangs turned up to the cinema and people got stabbed and stuff”  —   but it brought her to the attention of “Wiley and Kano and Ghetts, all these people I'd grown up listening to . .. I didn't tell my parents I was moving to London. I just packed one suitcase, I left and I never went back. I think I told my mum I was going on a trip with the college or something. ” Her real break came when she uploaded a   parody video of Chris Brown and Busta Rhymes's Look At Me Now to YouTube: it got 100, 000 views in half a day, and Atlantic Records in the US offered her a deal. “They flew me out and we had a conversation, but their idea was that they were going to pit me against Nicki Minaj. It was like: ‘She's the biggest female MC and you need to take her down,' and I wasn't feeling that at all. That whole stereotype of female rappers and their supporters having to compete with each other  —   it seems to be a crime to be a fan of two female rappers that are successful. So I turned it down. The amount of money they were offering me was amazing. I've always turned to music to get my mum out of the house, out of that situation, so to see that type of money thrown at me . .. I'm not going to lie, I cried on the plane home, because I thought I'd made a mistake and my mum needed the money. It might have been my only chance. But I know by now I would probably have been dropped and my career would have been ruined. ” Back in the UK, she elected to put her career on hold for a year. “I was going through a lot myself, personally. I was living on couches, living out of bags and boxes, sometimes I wouldn't even know where I was sleeping the next day. And then I went through a situation where someone completely tried to destroy my career, someone I thought was a friend, who deleted all my social networks. So I had to start again, basically. So I was like: ‘You know what? I'm starting again as a brand new artist if you're going to do that.' I thought: I grew up on Missy, Eminem, Busta Rhymes, they had all those funny, rewatchable videos with crazy visuals and I think that's what was and still is missing in the scene. Humour was definitely something I thought would work, I thought it would be different if I brought that to the scene, with the beats I'm using, which I  . I wouldn't quite call them grime, they're a bit slower, people say they're a bit trap. I just wanted to create something new and fresh. ” It was a plan that has clearly worked beyond her wildest dreams, although she says she's keen not to be seen as just “a funny person . .. The album's going to do the talking, because everyone's thinking this is all I do, the funny stuff, and the album's going to show that it's not. ” The album isn't the only thing on her mind at the moment. She's still thinking about a clothing line, although, alas, the Friggin' L name has been retired. She's talking about going back into acting. She's starting work on her own sketch show, starring a selection of   she created on Snapchat. Whatever happens, she says, she has already managed to achieve her dream: with the money she made from The Queen's Speech's iTunes sales and YouTube hits, she's buying her mum a house. “I just kept setting money aside, and it's all still in the process at the moment. You know how mortgages are. But I'm eventually going to take her there, and it's going to have a massive bow on it, and I'm going to pretend it's my house that I've bought in Birmingham and then tell her it's hers. She has no idea. ” Unless she reads this, of course. She drains her glass of fizzy wine. “So much has happened just because of uploading a couple of videos, you know. I've had all these offers and artists reaching out, I've got to fly around the world and experiment with things I've never tried before. I've got half a million subscribers on my YouTube channel, I've got my own machine. So, that's basically made me realise: I'm on the up. ”"
106720,157527,Penn State plan to honor Joe Paterno prompts furious backlash,Guardian,,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/penn-state-joe-paterno-anniversary-backlash,"Penn State's athletic department on Thursday announced plans to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Joe Paterno's first game as coach, a move that sparked backlash on social networks by people critical of Paterno's role in the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal. The university announced plans Thursday to mark the anniversary when the Nittany Lions football team hosts Temple on 17 September. University spokesman Jeff Nelson told the Associated Press that Penn State plans to announce specifics of the commemoration to ticket holders during the week of the game. He declined further comment on the plans. Paterno coached at Penn State for 46 seasons, becoming college football's winningest coach. But the coach was fired by the school's board of trustees shortly after Sandusky, who was his defensive coordinator, was arrested in November 2011 for child sexual abuse. Paterno died in January 2012 of lung cancer. The announcement to honor Paterno's first game was met with disdain on social media sites from those who partially blame Paterno for the scandal.  In May, unsealed court documents said an alleged Sandusky victim said he complained to Paterno about Sandusky in 1976 and was rebuffed. The university's president has said the allegation was not substantiated in court or tested by any other process. Paterno was never charged with a crime related to the scandal. Sandusky was convicted on 45 of 48 charges in June 2012 and is serving a   to   sentence. Moving forward from the scandal has proven a difficult challenge for Penn State, requiring leaders to balance distancing the university from the scandal while juggling the wishes of ardent Penn State supporters who credit Paterno for giving the university an identity to be proud of.  “Depending on their position people may look at him differently, but it doesn't change that he created that here. Or helped to create that here,” athletic director Sandy Barbour told the AP in August. The Paterno Foundation had already scheduled a private celebration of the 50th anniversary of Paterno's first game as head coach with a Football Lettermen's reunion on 16 September at Lubrano Park in State College. Penn State alum and university trustee Anthony Lubrano has been part of a group of Paterno supporters that have been pushing for the school to officially recognize the anniversary. The statue of Paterno was removed from outside Beaver Stadium on 22 July 2012 and highly visible, university sponsored signs of him are mostly hard to find. Paterno's name is still on the campus library, which was built in part by his donations. "
106869,157724,Trump's Great Gatsby government will be a gift to the rich,Guardian,Nomi Prins,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/02/donald-trump-cabinet-positions-wealthy-key-interests,"Trump's administration will be the most affluent ever. Estimates are imprecise because we don't even know the  's true net worth, but the wealth of his cabinet picks so far range from $12bn to $35bn. At the very least, this quadruples that of the Obama cabinet. But more than just representing his friends, loyalists and family, the natural alliances among these people, their hallowed predispositions, will impact the policies they form.  We know the dangers of this skewed power. Before F Scott Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby, he published The Rich Boy, a 1924 short story, in which the narrator says: “Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me . .. They think, deep in their hearts, that they are better than we are because we had to discover the compensations and refuges of life for ourselves. ” Fitzgerald questioned the moral and ethical vacuity of the rich in his works. His work was first penned in the glitz of the roaring 1920s. Then, the wealthiest citizens clanked champagne flutes to their own good fortunes, while the majority of the population struggled in the proverbial alleyways. Is it really so different today? Despite all his populist slogans, Trump was born with a golden spoon in his mouth. He understands having money because he never had to understand not having money. He understands bending the rules because he's made money doing that. He became president doing that. He boasted about it during the election. He gravitates to people similar to him, billionaires and up and coming millionaires. His cabinet choices are pedigreed and skilled at using the government to their profit advantage. We are supposed to believe that because they know how that game is played, that as public officials they will divert those talents on our behalf. The only fly in that ointment is that they have no reason to do so.  We have Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary nominee, whose hedge fund took over a California bank in 2009 on the cheap, got the government to back the risk of the deal and proceeded to foreclose on 36, 000 homes between   reaping a profit for him and his group of around $1. 5bn. He's not going to regulate the industry that handed him that windfall. Then, there's Commerce secretary nominee Wilbur Ross who made billions taking over flailing steel and other industrial companies, pushing costs like pension payments onto the government and firing people in the process. He's not about to advocate for unions or higher minimum wages or equal pay for women in the workplace.  Education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos never went to, nor sent her children to, public schools. So you can bet she won't be advocating for federal funds to elevate conditions for the middle or poorer classes that attend them. Transportation secretary nominee (and millionaire) Elaine Chao is on the board of Wells Fargo which engaged in scamming its customers for years.  She will likely be given a carte blanche on road and bridge privatization, not necessarily public funding for them, which will enable Wall Street to securitize the profits. It's said that given her marriage to Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell, she'll be able to convince him to push for infrastructure spending on roads and highways, but it's more likely the big industrial and construction companies will get sweetheart government contracts that will somehow come out of our pockets in the process.  The rest of his cabinet either has similar bends or remains to be filled, but the themes can be examined under the auspices of what keeps the powerful in power, and that is simply: not to share it. The deregulation of Wall Street and other industries, reduction of transparency in reporting, the cutting of corporate taxes which push the tax and debt burden onto the rest of the population, are not simply policy choices. They are strategies of a power elite that wants to preserve itself, at any cost to the rest of us. In the wake of the Great Depression, Fitzgerald, who attended Princeton, but hailed from poorer roots than many of his classmates, went on to say: “I have never been able to forgive the rich for being rich, and it has colored my entire life and works. ” We won't be able to forgive the rich in Trump's cabinet either  —   especially if they continue to ignore the needs of the 99%."
107003,157914,Facebook plans to invest $20m in affordable housing projects,Guardian,Sam Levin,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/02/facebook-affordable-housing-silicon-valley,"Facebook has agreed to invest $20m in affordable housing initiatives after facing intense criticism for failing to help   residents in Silicon Valley where the technology boom has exacerbated displacement and gentrification. The corporation, which is pushing forward with a massive campus expansion in northern California, announced on Friday a partnership with community organizations aimed at funding affordable housing construction and assisting tenants facing eviction. Housing activists who have long been critical of Facebook and its role in accelerating income inequality in the region said the investment marked an “unprecedented” collaboration between Silicon Valley corporations and advocacy groups and that the project could push neighboring tech companies to better address local poverty. “I'm hoping this fund will be the thing that starts to move the rest of the region,” said Tameeka Bennett, executive director of Youth United for Community Action (Yuca) a   in East Palo Alto that helped negotiate the new agreement. The housing shortage has reached crisis levels in Silicon Valley, which is also home to Google, Apple and many other wealthy technology firms. Rapid job creation combined with a lack of new housing has created an estimated shortfall of 22, 000 homes, with the region building only 26% of the housing needed for   people, according to   group Public Advocates. That means only the wealthy can afford to live near their Silicon Valley jobs, forcing an estimated 70, 000   workers to commute more than 50 miles to work. Facebook, headquartered in Menlo Park, has contributed to the problem in direct and indirect ways. The company sparked backlash after it began offering generous bonuses to employees if they live near campus, which advocates say has hastened gentrification. Local real estate managers have evicted   tenants en masse, explicitly marketing units to Facebook employees. The funding announced this week is not simply a philanthropic donation from Facebook, which is valued at $350bn. The corporation is legally required to fund certain community benefits as part of its ongoing expansion project, and activists have spent months pressuring the company to make substantial investments. Facebook plans to add 126, 000 sq ft to its campus and bring 6, 500 new employees to the area, increasing the Menlo Park workforce by 20%. Development laws mandated that the corporation contribute $6. 3m to    housing. Still,   leaders said the housing fund could have a significant impact and noted that Facebook executives have relied heavily on the input of local advocates with the kind of intensive collaboration advocates rarely see from corporations. “The community groups that have the expertise really were equal players,” said Sam   senior staff attorney at Public Advocates, which had raised formal objections to Facebook's expansion proposal.  “I hope having one large prominent Silicon Valley company leading the way on this will be a   call for all the other global corporations that the Bay Area is hosting and the need for them to work locally,” he added, “rather than just thinking of themselves as global corporations that exist online. ” In addition to investing $18. 5m toward the creation and preservation of affordable housing, the company has offered $500, 000 toward legal and rental assistance to tenants threatened with displacement. A Facebook spokesman told the Guardian that the company doesn't have projections on the number of housing units the partnership could fund, but noted that the $20m is an “initial contribution” and said the company hopes to “attract additional public, private and philanthropic entities to contribute to the fund”. Kyra Brown, Yuca's social justice program director, said it was critical that Facebook do a better job diversifying its workforce and hire locally in East Palo Alto, a historically black city. African American employees make up only 3% of the corporation's senior leadership in the US. “Silicon Valley is known as this very innovative place when it comes to addressing everyday issues,” she said, “but my hope is that we also take that same innovation and apply it to social issues. ”  Brown, who grew up in East Palo Alto, said the announcement was an important first step in the tech sector helping to address inequities in the communities they've entered. “I'm glad that Facebook is thinking about the legacy it wants to leave particularly when it comes to communities of color,” she said."
107059,158005,Obama administration denies secret loopholes in Iran nuclear agreement,Guardian,Julian Borger,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/01/obama-secret-iran-nuclear-deal,"The Obama administration has insisted that the terms of a nuclear agreement signed last year with Iran were being upheld after a Washington think tank alleged that Tehran had been granted secret exemptions.  A report by the Institute for Science and International Security alleged that a joint commission set up to implement the Vienna deal had allowed Iran to keep more than the agreed maximum of 300 kg of low enriched uranium (LEU) by excluding waste material in Iran's nuclear facilities. If enriched further, LEU could be used in a nuclear warhead.  The institute's director and   of the report, David Albright, said that this and other exemptions were granted by the commission in secret.  “One of the biggest problems is we are being denied information in these cases,” Albright said. “If the joint commission has so many powers to change this deal, shouldn't we know what they're doing?” The state department denied that the 300 kg LEU limit set down in the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA) had been breached.  “There's been no loosening of the commitments and Iran has not and will not under the JCPOA be allowed to exceed the limits that are spelled out in the JCPOA,” spokesman John Kirby said. He added the only violation of the terms of the deal had been a temporary surplus in Iran's export of heavy water (which can be used in nuclear reactors to produce plutonium) but that had been corrected. Kirby also said the secrecy of the work of the joint commission, which represents all parties to the deal, was stipulated in last year's deal, signed by six world powers (the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China) the EU and Iran. “This is in compliance with the JCPOA which says the commission's work should be confidential unless all parties agree otherwise,” Kirby said.  However, while he repeatedly stated there had no been “no exceptions” to the quantitative limits set down in the agreement, Kirby did not respond directly to the question of exemptions. Albright's report claimed certain waste products and residues were not being included in the joint commission's inventory of nuclear materials. Kirby said he would not “talk about the specific work of the joint commission” As well as noting the   surplus, Albright's report said that “lab contaminant” containing 20% enriched uranium was being overlooked by the commission, and that Iran had been allowed to retain 19 “hot cells” larger than the specifications laid down in the JCPOA. Hot cells are special containers that allow technicians to handle radioactive matter with special gloves while being shielded. They can be used to separate plutonium from spent fuel on a small scale.  Kirby noted that the joint commission was given the authority to approve larger hot cells than envisaged in the agreement.  “We aren't saying anything has been violated here,” Albright said. “But the number of these hot cells is surprising. We don't know how many are being monitored by the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] and again, why is this secret?” Jim Walsh, an international security expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that it was the norm for arms control agreements to have secret sections.  “Secret doesn't mean evil. It's just standard operating procedure, and as this report says itself, Obama notified Congress. Congress has known this from the beginning,” Walsh said. On the question of the “hot cells” Walsh added: “The report admits these are being used for producing medical isotopes. There is no plutonium reactor in Iran. A reactor is years away, so allowing the existing hot cells is not a proliferation danger. ”  James Acton, the   of the nuclear policy programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: “The more complicated and comprehensive your arms control agreement, the more questions it throws up in implementation. “Under the Chemical Weapons Convention, the US had to destroy its stockpile by 2012, but it wasn't possible to meet that deadline. People didn't see that as an attempt to undermine the convention, and a pragmatic solution was found,” Acton said. “There is the same principle at work here. ” "
107167,158165,Walter Scott shooting: single juror forces deadlock and pushes trial into fifth week,Guardian,Oliver Laughland,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/02/walter-scott-shooting-trial-jury-michael-slager,"The jury in the murder trial of former police officer Michael Slager, who shot and killed unarmed African American Walter Scott as he ran away, is at deadlock after a single juror indicated during dramatic scenes in court they were unwilling to find the    guilty. The jury, consisting of 11 white people and one black person, will now continue deliberations on Monday, drawing the monthlong trial in South Carolina into a fifth week. If their decision is not unanimous a mistrial will be declared, leaving prosecutors to decide whether to pursue a retrial. The former North Charleston police officer has been charged with murder and manslaughter after shooting Scott, 50, five times from behind as he ran away with his back turned. The incident, which occurred in April 2015, was caught on video by a witness, propelling the case into the global spotlight.  The release footage has been cited by advocates as among the clearest evidence of the fatal consequences of racially biased policing in the US. On Friday, after over 14 hours of deliberations, the jury's foreman indicated in a note to South Carolina judge Clifton Newman that they would not be able to reach a unanimous decision. “It is clear that jurors will not be able to come to consensus,” the note read.  The jury then returned a second time in the afternoon indicating it was still deadlocked, with a unanimous decision hinging on just one juror. During tense scenes in the courtroom, a note from that single juror was read aloud by Newman. “Judge, I understand the position of the court, but I cannot with good conscience consider a guilty verdict,” the juror wrote. “I expect those who hold opposing views not to change their minds because they are good honest people. ”  In a subsequent note sent by the foreperson, it was stated that the juror wanted “to leave” as they were “having issues”. Under South Carolina law a jury cannot be sent out to deliberate again after it has returned for a second time with no verdict, unless it requests “further explanation of the law”.  The jury's foreperson made that request to Newman. Slager's defense team have moved for a mistrial, while the state prosecution urged the judge to provide the jury with the explanation it requested.  After a brief recess, Newman indicated he would not declare a mistrial and requested a note from the jury asking precisely what explanation of the law was required. “At this stage of things, with the jury indicating a willingness and interest . .. it would be improper for the court to declare a mistrial,” Newman said.  A foreperson for the jury then told the judge in a note that “they [the jury] are beat and need some time. We will have our questions at the time. ”  The jury's request for explanation likely relates to an earlier application on Thursday made by the jury requesting clarification on the legal distinction between “fear” and “passion” the potential difference between a claim of justifiable   which Slager's legal team have argued throughout, and a manslaughter conviction, which would find that Slager unlawfully killed Scott in the heat of passion. Newman had declined to provide the jury guidance, telling them on Friday morning that it was “solely for you” to decide. In response to the first declaration of deadlock, Newman called the jury back into the court room and urged them, under a   Allen charge, to continue deliberations and push for a decision.  “It isn't always easy for two people to agree so when 12 people must agree it must be more difficult,” he said.  “You have a duty to make every reasonable effort to reach a unanimous verdict,” the judge said. “Discuss your differences with an open mind. ”  Newman warned that a split decision would result in a mistrial meaning that “at some other time I will try this case with some other jury where you now sit   …     we will go through this whole process again”. After the day's dramatic hearing in court, members of the Scott family said during a short press conference that they were hopeful the remaining juror would change their mind.  “We feel the prayers. We feel the presence of God. And we know that God has been moving in our favour. It's been a long day. It's been a tough day. But it's not over,” said Anthony Scott, Walter's brother.  With reference to the book of Psalms, Scott continued in tears: “Joy will come in the morning. Joy will come. We know that we are going to receive our joy, because God say so. ”  The Scott family's attorney Chris Stewart echoed Scott's feelings of hope, adding: “This is not a black family against Michael Slager. This is the world against Michael Slager. ”  On Wednesday, Newman allowed the jury to consider the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter, meaning an unlawful killing that occurred without “malice” but rather in the heat of passion after provocation. Slager had originally been charged with murder. Voluntary manslaughter carries a sentence of two to 30 years in prison, while a murder sentence carries 30 years to life in prison. The trial has been characterised by an aggressive defence from Slager's lawyers, who unsuccessfully attempted to have the pivotal video struck out as evidence and then accused the eyewitness who filmed it, Feidin Santana, of being ideologically opposed to law enforcement. During closing arguments Slager's lead defense lawyer, Andrew Savage, unleashed a tirade against the media, arguing his client had become a “poster boy” for perceived police brutality around the US and placed blame for the incident on Scott, a father of four, for his “felonious conduct”. The prosecution have argued consistently that the evidence contained in the video alone is overwhelming and proves Slager killed Scott unlawfully.  Slager has also been indicted on federal charges of violating Scott's civil rights, which also carries a maximum sentence of life."
116587,172077,6 Things You Might Not Have Known About Trump's Border Enforcement Plan,NPR,Scott Horsley,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/09/01/492270569/6-things-you-might-not-have-known-about-trump-s-border-enforcement-plan,"To carry out his   immigration policy, Trump proposed hiring 5, 000 additional Border Patrol agents and tripling the number of ”deportation officers.” But that would continue an already   expansion of the government agencies responsible for those tasks  —   even as the number of illegal border crossers has shrunk dramatically. That's not even to mention the billions of dollars it would cost to build a    wall across the length of the entire U. S.  border. Here are six things to consider: 1. Border Patrol agents have doubled and the 2013 Senate bill proposed a bigger increase than Trump: The number of authorized agents has more than doubled since 2002 to more than 21, 000. (According to the National Border Patrol Council, the officers union, about 1, 500 of those authorized positions are unfilled owing to attrition.) Trump's proposal would represent a 24 percent increase in authorized jobs. The bipartisan immigration bill passed by the Senate in 2013 would have gone even further, expanding the Border Patrol to more than 38, 000. Federal spending on the Border Patrol has also grown rapidly, climbing from $1. 4 billion in fiscal year 2002 to $3. 8 billion last year. 2. Apprehensions are down: Despite the growing number of officers patrolling the border, fewer   crossers are being caught. Apprehensions have fallen 79 percent from their peak in 2000. This is generally seen as a sign that fewer people are trying to cross the border illegally. Increased border security and a   U. S. economy are thought to have discouraged illegal immigration. The Pew Research Center found that more Mexicans left the USA than entered between 2009 and 2014. 3. Spending on enforcement is way up: As with the Border Patrol, federal spending on Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which shares responsibility for enforcing immigration law, has already jumped by 84 percent since 2005. Trump did not say how he would raise the money to triple the ICE deportation force. 4. Deportations  —   or ”removals” in ICE parlance  —   increased during Obama's first four years in office, reaching a peak of 409, 849 in 2012. Since then, deportations have been dropping to a low of 235, 413 last year. Since 2014, the Obama administration has focused on deporting recent arrivals and criminals. There have been fewer deportations of immigrants who have lived in the U. S. for years and whose only crime was crossing the border illegally. In all, about 2. 8 million have been deported under Obama. Unlike this president, though, Trump says there should be no path to legalization for these longtime immigrants, short of returning to their home countries and reapplying for admission. Trump stopped short of repeating his call for mass deportation, saying the status of these immigrants could be addressed ”in several years,” after a ”great wall” is completed and illegal flows are ended for good. In the meantime, he wants to prioritize deportation of ”criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays” and those who rely on public welfare, along with ”millions of recent illegal arrivals.” The Washington Post estimates that, in all, some 6 million people could be subject to deportation if Trump's promised policies were to take effect. 5. Criminal deportation because of   or something else? Trump said there are ”at least 2 million criminal aliens now inside the country,” who would be deported immediately if he becomes president. That figure comes from an analysis of ICE data by the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for low immigration. According to the center's executive director, Mark Krikorian, that figure includes immigrants living legally in the U. S. whose criminal record makes them eligible for deportation. Trump suggested the only reason criminals haven't been deported already is federal  . ”The local police know who every one of these criminals are,” he said. ”They've put up with it for years. And now, finally, we will turn the tables and law enforcement will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.” In fact, local and state governments sometimes refuse to cooperate with federal immigration officials, for fear that overzealous deportation practices would target   offenders and alienate local immigrant communities. 6. Go back to . .. Canada? Trump says he'll make a priority of removing visitors who overstay their visas  —   an estimated   people each year. According to the Pew Research Center, nearly 1 in 5   holders comes from Canada."
116588,172078,"Trump Makes Nice In Mexico, Talks Tougher Than Ever Just Hours Later In Phoenix",NPR,Ron Elving,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/09/01/492196408/trump-makes-nice-in-mexico-talks-tougher-than-ever-just-hours-later-in-phoenix,"Trump has provided the political world with many moving moments over the past year, but none quite like the whiplash mood swing between his daytime and nighttime performances in Mexico City and Phoenix on Wednesday. In the daylight hours, Trump struck his most presidential pose to date with a solemn (if somewhat grumpy) reading of prepared remarks at a news conference alongside Mexico's President Enrique Peña Nieto. That somber event, inside the Mexican presidential residence, epitomized the more moderate image Trump has pursued on immigration issues over the past 10 days. But as night fell in Phoenix, back in the U. S. A. Trump mounted the stage in prime time and quickly caught fire. He poured forth an hourlong harangue against all things alien, highlighting the lurid crimes of a handful of illegal immigrants as if to define the character of millions. He also promised to build ”a beautiful wall” across the entire U. S.  border and create a ”deportation task force” that would eventually guarantee that ”the bad ones are gone.” On the subject of the wall, Trump departed from his script to assure his listeners that Mexico would indeed pay for it  —   adding, ”They may not know it yet, but they will.” In so doing, he as much as acknowledged that Peña Nieto had told him something different earlier in the day. That was not a minor point, but rather a sore one. The issue of the wall's cost had taken over the news and Twitter feeds earlier in the evening. Trump himself had insisted at the news conference in Mexico City that the two men did not discuss the financing of the wall. Peña Nieto, who did not contradict Trump at the time (maintaining a striking deference to the American throughout their joint appearance) later tweeted that he had begun their meeting by saying Mexico would never pay for such a wall, a stance Mexican officials have taken consistently. None of the Trump surrogates appearing across the media landscape Wednesday night seemed to dispute this, saying rather that the Wednesday meeting had ”not been a negotiation” and that more formal talks would ensue on the wall and its financing. Rest assured, they seemed to say, Mexico will come around. Throughout the Phoenix speech, Trump read from a teleprompter but supercharged the script with his own asides and   many of which riled the already raucous crowd to transports of delight. At one moment, promising to rid the land of criminal immigrants, he shouted that ”in the first hour they are gone,” and the throng exulted. Trump in such moments would back away and himself applaud until the roar subsided. Listening to the speech, marveling at the   maneuver, one could almost hear the spirited debate within the councils of Trump's campaign. One imagined Kellyanne Conway, the    manager, arguing for the quickie trip to Mexico and the confab with Peña Nieto. Since stepping up in   she has been seen as a moderating influence, seeking a new tone and tenor more appealing to white suburban voters (especially women and college graduates). With Conway seeming to be ascendant, one could easily imagine the day ending with a very different speech in Phoenix. Would Trump not hail his conquest of Mexico City, citing his domination of the news conference where he practically had the Mexican president poised on his knee? Would Trump not repeat his lines of praise for ”first, second and   Mexican Americans” he said were ”beyond reproach” and even ”spectacular,   people”? The die seemed to be cast, and the timing seemed propitious. Because two weeks of adverse publicity about the ClintonFoundation and its donors and about newly discovered emails at the State Department have helped erode Clinton's already weak standing with voters. For the first time, her disapproval numbers were almost equal to Trump's. Conway seemed to have found just the right moment to raise her candidate's acceptability score in contrast with his opponent. But if this was the opportunity for a turnaround that changed the broad public perception of Trump, it was a moment not only missed but thrust away with both hands. For as soon as that moderating narrative got airborne, Trump's speech in Phoenix took off after it with the speed and fury of an   missile. The explosion as the two met in midair against the desert sky was spectacular indeed. That intercept was launched, in all likelihood, from the campaign's other new major domo, Steve Bannon, the former publisher of Breitbart. com, the   voice of the   movement. Bannon, now called the CEO of the Trump campaign, has been a fan of the   approach on immigration as well as other issues. And whether he or another wordsmith in the Trump camp wrote the script, it was the fuel for one of the candidate's most incendiary performances. In the speech, Trump not only doubled down on the wall and the invoice to Mexico, but on a ”deportation task force” that would either drive the undocumented out of the country of their own accord or arrest them and send them to their countries of origin. The ”softening” often promised in recent days seemed to consist only in the delay of the deportation endeavor until the wall could be completed and all the criminal elements of the illegal population first removed. Trump made a point of including in his ban the ”dreamers,” present in the U. S. now as adults because they were brought to the country as minor children by their parents. This has been an especially popular target group for immigration reformers, and Obama protected them from deportation orders with one of his executive actions. At some point, Trump allowed, ”we will bring back the good ones.” But moments after making this concession to what he has called ”being humane about it,” Trump was filling the stage with the grieving parents of people killed by immigrants in the country illegally. After a day spent putting his weight down on one foot, the Republican nominee was standing firm on the other. And he left little doubt where he would remain through the rest of this campaign."
116589,172079,PHOTOS: Venezuelans Take To The Streets In Protest Against The Government,NPR,Camila Domonoske,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/01/492260941/photos-venezuelans-take-to-the-streets-in-protest-against-the-government,"They call it ”The Taking of Caracas.” A flood of Venezuelans  —   supporters of the opposition, unhappy with President Nicolas Maduro  —   marched in the country's capital on Thursday, demanding a recall election. Venezuela's economy is in freefall. Food shortages have left grocery stores bare, while medicine shortages have frustrated doctors who say they have a fraction of the supplies that they need. Inflation is rampant, lootings and riots are common and blackouts are frequent, as John Otis has been reporting for NPR for months. All this, in the country with the world's largest oil reserves. Maduro's approval ratings have plummeted, but as NPR's Lulu   has reported, the socialist leader is holding firmly to his power. His government ”controls the judiciary, the military, the executive and most of the media in the country,” Lulu notes. And some public servants believe they have been fired as retribution for supporting a recall vote. ”Venezuela's government says it is the victim of an economic war that has crippled its economy,” Lulu says. ”It alleges the opposition is in the pay of the U. S. government, which is intent on overthrowing it. The opposition and the U. S. both deny this charge.” Military and police forces were deployed across the city ahead of Thursday's march, as Maduro accused the march organizers of planning a coup. Opposition leaders, who were hoping 1 million people would show up to the protest, say they are hoping to put enough political pressure on the government to push a recall vote to happen this year. Maduro, speaking at a counterprotest in support of the government, mocked the turnout as being far lower than expected  —   he pegged it at 30, 000, while organizers said it was much higher, The Associated Press reports. Otis explained what's at stake: ”Should Maduro lose, new elections would be held  —   and the opposition would stand a good chance of returning to power for the first time since the late Hugo Chavez ushered in Venezuela's socialist revolution in 1999. ”Critics claim the government is stalling for time. The country's electoral council, which nearly always sides with the executive branch, says there may not be enough time to gather signatures and organize the voting process to hold the recall this year, and that the vote very likely will have to be held in 2017. ”Should that happen, and Maduro loses, his vice president would take over  —   keeping the ruling socialists in power until at least 2019.” Among the marchers, The Associated Press reports, were about 100 indigenous people  —   from the Piaroa and Jiwi tribes  —   who traveled from the Amazon to protest. A member of the Piaroa tribe was accused of fraud and jailed last year during elections, ”a case the government used to disqualify three indigenous leaders from taking seats in the   legislature,” the news service writes. The protesters have vowed another show of force next Wednesday. Otis, who frequently reports from Venezuela for NPR, tried to travel to Caracas to cover the protest for us. But he was blocked at the border  —   the government was turning away foreign reporters. He wrote about the experience Wednesday night: ”Apparently the government thinks it can control or tamp down news coverage of Thursday's protest by keeping out foreign reporters. But international news organizations like CNN, AP, Reuters and Bloomberg News all have permanent correspondents here, so it's not like proceedings will go unnoticed. ”What's more, sending us packing only reinforces the government's   reputation with the press. I had to sign an official letter declaring myself an 'inadmissible person' and add my two thumbprints to the document.”"
116590,172080,'Alien' Signal Source Reportedly Located (It Wasn't The Vulcans),NPR,Bill Chappell,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/01/492299629/alien-signal-source-reportedly-located-it-wasnt-the-vulcans,"If it were a phone call, we might call it a butt dial: A strong radio signal that set off questions about whether it emanated from an advanced alien race earlier this week is now believed to have come from a terrestrial source, and possibly from a Russian military satellite. The clarification came after researchers at the SETI Institute  —   the private organization that searches for signals that might confirm extraterrestrial life  —   announced they were investigating an ”interesting” radio signal that was reported by Russian astronomers, as Camila Domonoske wrote for the   on Tuesday. But Camila also noted that some experts were warning the signal might be merely interference, and possibly military in origin  —   and it now seems that that's the case. The signal was detected in 2015 by Russian astronomers using the   radio telescope in Zelenchukskaya, at the foot of the Caucasus Mountains north of Georgia. The discovery drew notice because of the signal's design and ”beam shape,” SETI senior astronomer Seth Shostak wrote earlier this week. The signal had come from the same direction as the star system HD164595, which sits in the Hercules constellation and has a star that's comparable to our sun. But Shostak's SETI colleagues were unable to detect the signal, and in an update to his original blog post, Shostak says that both Russian news agencies and the Russian Academy of Sciences have concluded that the signal ”is, indeed, terrestrial interference.” The intense media interest in the signal came one year after it was detected that interest seems to have been prompted by the signal's mention in a recent scientific presentation by Russian astronomers and Italian researcher Claudio Maccone, who chairs the International Academy of Astronautics Permanent SETI Committee. (Side note: Maccone succeeded Shostak in that position, according to his bio.) Among those who took note of the signal hubbub was American astronomer Paul Gilster, who said that while it was too early to deem this a case of alien technology, the signal's strength suggested that if it came from outer space, it could be generated only by civilizations that are either Type I or Type II on the Kardashev scale of civilizations' sophistication. If you're wondering, Earth is still working its way toward being a Type I. An outburst of international interest in the signal followed, with some casting the signal as a herald of our new alien overlords. That led the Russian Academy of Sciences to issue a statement clarifying that ”processing and analysis of the signal revealed its most probable terrestrial origin.” A report by the Russian news agency Tass suggests that the signal might have come from a Russian military satellite. Without directly connecting the signal to that satellite or providing details about it, Tass quotes Alexander Ipatov, the director of the Institute of Applied Astronomy at the Russian Academy of Sciences, as saying that during the Soviet era, ”We, indeed, discovered an unusual signal. However, an additional check showed that it was emanating from a Soviet military satellite, which had not been entered into any of the catalogs of celestial bodies.” The folks at SETI and the Russian Academy of Sciences say they're still looking for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence. As the RAS writes, ”It can be said with confidence that no   signal has been detected yet.”"
116591,172081,"Organic Gatorade: It's Still Loaded With Sugar, Folks",NPR,Allison Aubrey,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/09/01/492257166/organic-gatorade-its-still-loaded-with-sugar-folks,"Top brass at PepsiCo has talked for months about the introduction of an organic line. And now, according to Bloomberg, the company is rolling out G Organic  —   yep, an organic version of the famously technicolored sports drink Gatorade. (Think crimson red, electric blue and neon green shades.) ”Gatorade really dominates the [sports drink] market right now,” says Beth Bloom, senior food and drink analyst at the market research firm Mintel. Gatorade commands 77 percent of sports drink sales in the U. S. ”I think the [organic line] will broaden the appeal,” says Bloom. G Organic will be ”one additional offering in their line that may [offer] a little bit of a better health profile.” Bloom says health is definitely a driver in the purchase of organic products: ”We're seeing that about half of consumers who purchase organic products do so because they think they're healthier than   products.” But is this new line of organic Gatorade really any better for you? I put the question to Haemi Choi, a sports medicine doctor at Loyola University Medical Center. She says some consumers like to see artificial colors and flavors removed from products. ”It's more natural,” Choi says. ”But I don't think it's healthier per se. It's pretty similar,” she says. Take, for instance, the sugar content. Even though Gatorade seems to have switched to an organic cane sugar for its new organic line, Choi says that, nutritionally, this makes little difference. (We asked Gatorade to confirm the ingredient list of the new organic line, but did not hear back in time for press.) Overall, Choi says the new organic line seems to contain about the same amount of sugar  —   about 20 grams per   bottle. At a time we're told to cut back on sugar, she notes that many of us are already getting too much in our diet. ”The average American consumes about 350 added calories from sugar [each day].” For instance, women are told to limit consumption to somewhere between 25 and 37 grams of sugar per day, total. ”So, drinking a bottle of [sports drink] is already getting you close to what you should get in one day,” Choi says. Choi says unless you're exercising vigorously for an hour or longer and sweating a lot, you don't need to drink any kind of sports drinks  —   organic or not. If you're out for a casual jog or bike ride, you don't need electrolyte replacement, either. So, what does Choi recommend for quenching thirst? ”I say, drink water,” she says. Lots of dieticians agree. ”Sugar is sugar, so no matter if it's organic or not, it's still going to have the same effect on your body,” says Lisa Cimperman, a clinical dietician and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. If you consume too much, it may have negative effects on your waistline and can increase   levels. And as we've reported, excess sugar is also linked to a higher risk of heart disease. Cimperman says the new organic label may lead consumers to think organic Gatorade is healthier for them. ”I think it's a marketing ploy to apply this organic health halo to this product,” Cimperman says. And that halo will likely cost you more. Bloomberg reports that G Organic will cost about an extra 50 cents per 16. 9 ounce bottle, compared to the   options of the same size, such as Gatorade Thirst Quencher."
116592,172082,Kolkata Isn't Just The City Of Mother Teresa ,NPR,Sandip Roy,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/09/01/492241057/calcutta-isnt-just-the-city-of-mother-teresa,"Only five Indian citizens have won the Nobel Prize, and four of them have a deep Kolkata connection. This is a source of great pride to us with roots in that city. But when I went to the U. S. I realized quickly that nobody had heard of literary giant Rabindranath Tagore or physicist C. V. Raman. Even economist Amartya Sen was not that  . But everyone knew of Mother Teresa. When Americans learned I was born in the city, the first thing they'd usually ask is: ”Have you ever met Mother Teresa?” As a matter of fact, I had seen her. And like many in Kolkata, I have mixed feelings about her relationship with our city. I went to a   missionary school in Kolkata in the 1980s. We   boys did not have to go to catechism classes, but as part of our ”social service” we routinely went to her homes for the destitute with packets of milk powder, biscuits and old clothes. We were young and Mother Teresa, then in her 70s, already seemed impossibly old and hunched, her wrinkled face a startling contrast to the crisp pleats of her    saris. We admired her because she did what we did not have the stomach for  —   tending to men and women whose limbs were stunted by leprosy, looking after children with lesions, comforting the dying. I came from a   family that insulated me from all of that. We looked away when the beggar without hands knocked on the car window with his stumps wrapped in grubby bandages. Mother Teresa did not just look that beggar in the eye. She embraced him. Her devotion to my city, where she lived from the 1930s until her death in 1997, could not be questioned, and I was not one of those who only saw her foreignness.   Mother Teresa was an integral part of my city she was as much a Kolkatan as I was. But she did not define my city for me. She was part of the patchwork that made up Kolkata along with its artists, its filmmakers, its politicians, its cricketers. Only when I went to America as a student did it start feeling as if my city had somehow become Mother Teresa City and nothing more. I would always feel uneasy, almost guilty, when I met those volunteers who had been to Kolkata. For them it was their hardship posting and a place of  . For me it was just home. It made me wonder how I could take pride in a woman whose life's work was at its essence all about the failures of my city. Those sick, those poor, those dying, those diseased were all the people who had been abandoned by my city, spurned by their government, failed by their social service organizations. Pride in her Nobel made me a little queasy. This is not to pretend that the suffering underbelly that Mother Teresa exposed was not real. Not at all. But there was another Kolkata as well  —   a city of coffeehouses and bookstores a city of great political fervor and artistic ferment a city with Swiss patisseries, Jewish bakeries and Bengali sweet shops a city with its own triumphs and tribulations  —   and that city was lost in her overwhelming aura. Mother Teresa died while I was in America, but the Kolkata she left in the global imagination remained my cross to bear. This image of Kolkata was not concocted by Mother Teresa. In 1756, more than 140 British soldiers and civilians were imprisoned by the local nawab of Bengal in a small dungeon in a fort in Kolkata. One hundred   died of suffocation and heat exhaustion. That tragedy gave birth to the phrase ”Black Hole of Calcutta,” an image the city never shook off. In Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night a character says, ”Can't expect us to live in the Black Hole of Calcutta.” Over two centuries later an Indian prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, raised the hackles of the city when he casually called it a ”dying city,” one that had fallen off the map of major airlines. Then along came Dominique Lapierre and his 1985 novel, City of Joy, which became a film that cemented that image of Kolkata as the helpless crucible of India's poverty waiting for a Patrick Swayze to come save it from itself. Kolkata, like many Indian cities, still grapples with poverty and economic uncertainty, but it's also one of India's more affordable and safer cities, no longer beset by power cuts and embarking on ambitious infrastructure projects. It's also the city with India's first subway system. Once the capital of the British Indian Empire, it has long been seen as a city in decline, racked by political unrest, beset by power cuts, abandoned by industry. Even its resident Bengalis have left in droves for opportunities elsewhere. Yet it's still a city that survives and rejoices and celebrates. We have drunk beer on its rooftops and sipped steaming cups of tea while sitting on its front porches. Mother Teresa followed her calling as we must each follow ours. But now as she becomes a saint, the world's media have come calling again to try to rediscover Mother Teresa's Kolkata. Many still go to her tomb with prayers and wishes written on chits of paper. Her Missionaries of Charity still run the homes she set up. And though critics wish they could have opened a     hospital with all the money her order received, the Missionaries of Charity have no intention to diversify. A part of me wants to think that now that she is officially a saint, she will be reclaimed by the Catholic Church as she should be. But as the state's chief minister inaugurates a   statue in the archbishop's house in the heart of the city and flies off to the Vatican to watch the beatification, as politicians demand rail stations and airports be named after her, I wonder if Kolkata can easily let its Mother Teresa go. As part of a recent beautification drive, the city authorities decided Kolkata's public structures, its bridges, overpasses, police stations, water tanks needed to have a uniform color scheme. Since the last few months that's been extended to the city's lights as well. The lampposts are draped in LEDs of the same color scheme. The colors happen to be blue and white  —   Mother Teresa colors. It's just coincidence, but at night as you land in my city for a moment you could be fooled into thinking you are entering the twinkling chapel of St. Teresa of Kolkata.

116593,172083,"Trump Wants A Special Prosecutor For Clinton. But They Can Be Political Weapons, Too",NPR,Carrie Johnson,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/09/01/492266302/trump-wants-a-special-prosecutor-for-clinton-but-they-can-be-political-weapons-t,"Republican presidential nominee Trump has been calling for a criminal investigation of his political opponent Clinton on the campaign trail this year. Trump is angry the FBI probe of Clinton's email server ended with no charges. Now, he says, an independent outsider needs to look at the ClintonFoundation. ”The Justice Department is required to appoint an independent special prosecutor because it has proven itself to be really, sadly, a political arm of the White House,” Trump said in Akron, Ohio, last week. Trump has offered no evidence to back up his claims that the Justice Department has been corrupted. But his call for a special prosecutor sounds familiar to people who study the intersection of law and politics. ”If you look at the chronology, pretty much the political party that does not control the White House tends to want special prosecutors and independent counsel laws,” said Ken Gormley, president of Duquesne University in Pittsburgh and the author of two books on special prosecutors. ”As soon as the party is in the White House, they don't want it anymore.” In modern times, the idea first cropped up during the 1970s. President Richard Nixon notoriously fired a special prosecutor who was getting close to the tapes that would bring down his administration. Five months after what became known as the Saturday Night Massacre, Congress started work on an independent counsel law. The idea was to insulate sensitive criminal investigations from meddling by the White House. The law would stand for about 20 years. It didn't produce many criminal convictions, but it did stir up a lot of trouble for presidents  —   and the people close to them. In 1996, Clinton became the first sitting first lady to testify before a grand jury. This one was investigating the Whitewater affair, an investigation that began with a real estate investment and morphed into scrutiny of President Bill Clinton's sexual improprieties. Clinton was never charged with wrongdoing, but the investigation left a mark. Years later, Gormley interviewed Bill Clinton about it. ”He made clear that his decision to allow and endorse the appointment of an independent counsel in the Whitewater matter was one of the biggest mistakes of his presidency,” Gormley said. ”In fact, the words he used at one point is that it was like Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. And almost from the moment he was in the White House, there were political opponents using special prosecutors to bring him down, and they were off to the races.” By 1999, when Congress considered whether to renew the statute, opposition came from nearly all sides. Even Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr told Congress the law had become a political weapon. ”The statutory mechanism intended to enhance confidence in law enforcement had the effect of weakening it,” Starr said, in arguing the law should not be reauthorized. ”Jurisdiction and authority over these sensitive matters ought to be returned to the Justice Department. And who will oversee them? The Congress, the press, the public.” That's exactly what happened. The law expired. But the Justice Department can still use special prosecutors. They're career lawyers, protected from political leaders at Justice by a firewall. During the George W. Bush years, special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald charged and convicted a top aide to the vice president. Justice Department leaders went on to deploy special prosecutors to investigate the firings of U. S. attorneys and the destruction of videotapes that showed torture of detainees. But authorities have relied on those prosecutors only sparingly, a position adopted by many, including Gormley. ”I think I've come to the conclusion that we are better off when we have less of these investigations rather than more,” he said. ”They should be reserved for very special and extreme occasions.” Otherwise, Gormley argued, they could distract from what's really important. ”As we as a country were just obsessed with the issue of Whitewater, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky and all of these distractions during the 1990s, there were people inside and outside the country literally plotting our attack,” he said. One of them, Gormley said, was Osama bin Laden."
116594,172084,A Kitty Leads A Double Life In Beatrix Potter's Posthumously Published Tale ,NPR,Maureen Corrigan,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/09/01/492088474/a-kitty-leads-a-double-life-in-beatrix-potters-posthumously-published-tale,"This year marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of Beatrix Potter, one of the most enduring and cherished children's authors of all time. To commemorate the anniversary, a new,    story by Potter, called The Tale of Kitty in Boots, has been released. Readers, we've been down this road before, not too long ago, and it didn't end well. Atticus Finch's reputation took a hit after his exposure in Harper Lee's Go Set A Watchman as a segregationist and reactionary extremist. Do we really want to risk losing cherished illusions about the likes of Squirrel Nutkin and Jemima   in exchange for the novelty of a freshly unearthed tale by Beatrix Potter? Oh, but it's already too late for this question. As many of us learned in Potter's most famous story, The Tale of Peter Rabbit, once the garden of unknown delights beckons, it's all but impossible to resist entering in. Here's the backstory to this ”new” Beatrix Potter book: Two years ago, a woman named Jo Hanks who's an editor at Penguin Random House in the United Kingdom came upon a reference to a letter that Potter wrote in 1914. In that letter, Potter mentioned working on the manuscript of a story about ”a   prime black Kitty cat who leads a rather double life.” Hanks dug into Potter's archives at The Victoria  Albert Museum and she found the manuscript of The Tale of   . Potter had written three drafts of the story and had done one watercolor illustration of Kitty, but for various reasons, she died in 1943 without completing the book. Skip to the present and this lavish debut edition of The Tale of   . To use an antiquated phrase that Potter herself would have known, this edition is ”done up brown.” Quentin Blake, best known for his work on Roald Dahl's books, has created the illustrations and, on an audio CD included with the book, Helen Mirren reads the story. Ironically, such glitzy trappings make for a disconcerting Potter reading experience. After all, the charm of Potter's tales emanates, in part, from their humility  —   the signature compactness of her books and animal characters. Add to that, the fact that Blake's style as an illustrator is jittery and impressionistic, in contrast to Potter's fluid precision. His illustrations end up emphasizing, rather than countering, the violence that lurks in even the most amiable Potter tale. That ominous tone is set in the very first story when Peter Rabbit's mother gives him and his sisters  —   Flopsy, Mopsy and    —   a warning: ”Now, my dears,” said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, ”you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden: your Father had an accident there he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.” In its own quaint way, Potter's landscape is every bit as Gothic as the Brontes'. And, sometimes, as in The Tale of    Potter's stories are nearly as surreal as Lewis Carroll's. The ”Kitty” in question here calls herself ”Miss Catherine St. Quintin,” and she does, indeed, lead a double life. By day she's the docile pet of a kind old lady by night she's a poacher who prowls the countryside armed with an   and dressed in ”a gentleman's Norfolk jacket, and little   boots.” Kitty is such a convincing gender nonconformist that she's mistaken for ”a sportsman” by Mrs.   the   from an earlier tale. Other recognizable furry faces include fellow feline Tabitha Twitchit, Mr. Tod the creepy fox and a much older Peter Rabbit, described as ”stout” and ”very fat.” Rest assured, this is the closest we come here to that dread Atticus Finch moment in which a beloved character is changed for the worse. Newly discovered manuscripts by revered authors hold out the promise of familiar, yet fresh, literary magic in truth, though, The Tale of    is just a curious afterword to the 24 children's books Potter completed in her lifetime. Perhaps the best thing about this ”new” story is that it will send some readers back to the originals and to the life of the extraordinary woman who wrote them. Potter was a naturalist, fascinated by fungi she was a shrewd businesswoman, who patented an early ”Peter Rabbit” doll and other   merchandise and she was an environmentalist, responsible for the preservation of much of The Lake District in England. Potter's tales sprang from her deep appreciation of all creatures slight and small, but  —   as a woman and a writer  —   she was a smart, tough cookie certainly no Mrs.  ."
116595,172085,Dallas Police Chief David O. Brown Announces His Retirement,NPR,Richard Gonzales,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/01/492296164/dallas-police-chief-david-o-brown-announces-his-retirement,"In a brief and surprising statement, Dallas Police Chief David O. Brown announced he is ending his   career as a member of his city's police force. Brown is perhaps best known for leading his department in the aftermath of the slaying of five Dallas police officers by a disgruntled war veteran on July 7. ”Let's always remember the fallen officers including the five officers on July 7, 2016, and the brave men and women of the Dallas Police Department for their sacrifices to keep Dallas safe. Their memory will remain with all of us forever,” Brown said. ”I know the people of Dallas will never forget the ultimate sacrifice they made on the streets of our city that awful night.” Brown gave no reason for his decision, saying he will be unavailable until Sept. 8, when he will hold a news conference. He said his retirement will be effective Oct. 22. As member station KERA reports, Brown joined the Dallas force in 1983 as a patrol officer and had moved up the ranks. His tenure as police chief has been mixed. With violent crime surging in Dallas earlier this year, Brown tried to reassign hundreds of officers to   neighborhoods and move more personnel to the 4 p. m. to midnight shift. That move prompted a backlash among the rank and file, and one police union called for his resignation. But Brown's public image changed in July when he projected steady and sensitive leadership of his   department at its darkest period. Chief Brown called the slain officers ”guardians” of democracy who died protecting the freedom of   protesters. Obama praised his leadership. In the aftermath of the killings, Brown cracked down on protesters. In his statement, Brown thanked his officers. ”Your extraordinary service will forever be etched in my heart and will serve as a guidepost for me in the next phase of my life,” he said. ”You will always be in my prayers.”"
116596,172086,Can Cute Virtual Reality Spiders Help Reduce Arachnophobia?,NPR,Barbara J. King,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2016/09/01/491991386/can-cute-virtual-reality-spiders-help-reduce-arachnophobia,"Eight yellow garden spiders, also called writing spiders or Argiope aurantia, set up shop at various locations around the exterior of my house this summer. These strikingly large,    spiders were fascinating to watch: Remaining immobile for long periods, occasionally they would rapidly travel their web  —   unusually patterned with its zigzag of silk or ”writing” in the center  —   to collect and ”wrap up” a tiny prey animal. Luckily for me, one of the biggest spiders resided directly outside my study window, so I could observe all this from only a few inches away, through clear glass. It was that solid barrier between the spider and me that made me so brave. Arachnophobia, though, isn't the same as a little bit of unease around spiders: It can be a serious and sometimes debilitating fear. Itsy, a Samsung Nordic Virtual Reality app, is meant to help significantly reduce spider fear in three hours. Developed by William Hamilton and tested in cooperation with psychologists at Stockholm University, Itsy takes techniques borrowed from cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, transports them into a gamelike VR environment, and introduces viewers to animated spiders that slowly become more realistic. I tried VR for the first time last January at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, where I watched iAnimal, Animal Equality and Condition One's VR film about pig slaughter. By the film's conclusion, I was so moved as to be in tears. But Itsy, unlike iAnimal, constructs a fake world with spiders that are at the beginning dressed up and made cute: Does that matter for how people react? Hamilton, speaking in a video, says that even if the environment in a particular VR app is simulated, ”the emotional response is not.” Itsy was tested with four volunteers, one each from Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland. In the video, Mette Marie Lei Lange from Denmark is shown first in a room with a tarantula in an exhibit case. Her fear is evident, and she says, ”I doubt that God exists if that thing does.” She adds, ”I don't understand it. It has too many legs.” I really liked the   humor in Lange's words and also her honesty. She knows that most spiders aren't dangerous (a point made vitally clear in the video) and she doesn't wish to pass on her arachnophobia to her two children. Her decision to try out the Itsy app was brave  —   given her phobia, I mean seriously brave, not the jokey ”brave” of my looking at a writing spider through my window. We can follow along in the   video, lasting around 12 minutes, to see for ourselves some of how Lange does before, during and after the VR experience. It's clear at the end that she felt helped: When she encounters the same   spider in the ”after” condition, she approaches much more closely, with a more relaxed body posture. I do have some constructive criticism. Given that Lange pinpoints her specific fear as rooted in the movements of spiders, shouldn't she, in the ”after” condition, encounter a spider that is moving, not just sitting immobile? And how do we know that the spider fear stays reduced for weeks and months after the   Itsy treatment? In an email message, Hamilton, through a third party, said that ”the effect will last as long as in a traditional treatment. We checked in with the test subjects and they are still relieved from their fear.” How long after, he didn't say. The Stockholm University study now underway, comparing the results of traditional CBT therapy using real spiders with VR therapy using animated spiders, will no doubt address that point. Though tamping down arachnophobia is Itsy's main aim, I love that another goal is to help spiders too: Fewer spiders may be killed in our homes once people become less afraid of them. (My house spiders get taken calmly or sometimes less calmly outdoors in   missions.) On Tuesday, as my husband and I did a final   census around the perimeter of our house, we spied what we're pretty sure is a spider egg sac hanging near our front   window. Next summer, I might need some VR help myself. Barbara J. King is an anthropology professor emerita at the College of William and Mary.

116597,172087,Costa Rica Becomes A Magnet For Migrants,NPR,Carrie Kahn,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/09/01/492066728/costa-rica-becomes-a-magnet-for-migrants,"Costa Rica is best known for its vacation beaches and lush rain forests. But recently it has become a thoroughfare for tens of thousands of migrants from South America and elsewhere who are hoping to reach the U. S. Many are from the Caribbean, but a significant number trekking through the country are Africans and Southeast Asians, and collectively, they are straining Costa Rica's welcoming reputation. Migration officer Marvin Rodriguez is on the phone. He's getting word that authorities are sending two buses carrying 120 migrants that just crossed into Costa Rica on its southern border with Panama. It'll take about two hours for them to arrive at this newly erected migrant shelter where he's stationed, in the small town of Buenos Aires, just north of the border. ”We've never seen anything like this,” says Rodriguez. But this is becoming increasingly common in Costa Rica. Migrants from many countries, Late last year, thousands of Cubans came. They got stuck in Costa Rica when Nicaragua refused to let them continue northward. Then soon after came Haitians, Nigerians, Congolese, and even Kashmiris started coming. Authorities say about 150 migrants arrive every day, though only about 30 can sneak out daily into Nicaragua. That's left most migrants stranded at shelters. Migrants like Maria Joseph, who arrived eight days ago with her husband and two daughters. In broken Spanish, she says her family flew from the Congo to Brazil, then crossed several South American countries by bus, paying off border guards all along the way, then walked eight grueling days through the jungle between Colombia and Panama. ”In Panama these five guys with guns got us, and took everything. Clothes, cellphones, all our money,” says Joseph. ”In Costa Rica, they don't take from you,” she says. ”They just give.” Mayte Castro Santi smiles when she hears the migrants speak well of the Costa Ricans. She's one of several local residents cooking two meals a day, washing the bedsheets and handing out donated clothes. Stirring a huge pot of white rice, she says that ”since our grandparents' time, Costa Ricans have always greeted people as best as we can.” Lately though, that goodwill is being put to the test. In just the past four months, more than 6, 500 migrants have been registered entering Costa Rica's southern border. The majority have told officials they are from Congo. But most are believed to be Haitians who were living in Brazil and left when their construction jobs in the run up to the Olympics ended. With so many migrants coming through, authorities say even if they could determine nationalities, mass detention or deportation is not an option financially or morally. ”A humanitarian challenge” President Luis Guillermo Solis says his country will not criminalize migration. ”It has to be seen as a humanitarian challenge and this is how we like to think we are handling it,” he says. Solis spoke at the Wilson Center, a Washington, D. C. think tank, after a meeting last week with Obama and Vice President Biden. The U. S. ambassador to Costa Rica, S. Fitzgerald Haney, says Costa Rica is a model for the world on how to treat refugees. ”We very much appreciate and applaud the government of Costa Rica for everything they are doing, and where we can help we will,” he says. The U. S. sent tents for 2, 400 families and is helping migration officials reduce a backlog of asylum applications. The country is also dealing with a record number of Central Americans, especially from El Salvador, seeking refuge. Starting this month, the U. S. will work with Costa Rica to resettle some of those asylum seekers in the U. S. While the current work with migrants is admirable, University of Costa Rica social science professor Carlos Sandoval says the country has a mixed record on accepting immigrant groups and   resettlement. Nicaraguans, who arrived here during the tumultuous 1980s and '90s, still fill the lowest jobs in society and get blamed for nearly all social ills. ”Insecurity, lack of health provisions and the like . .. you just blame it on the Nicaraguans,” he says. ”It is very common, that kind of justification.” Sandoval worries the newest refugees may suffer the same outcome, especially since there's no sign their numbers are letting up. Carlos Granados lives next to one of Costa Rica's official migrant shelters and has grown tired of the endless traffic. ”It's great being good people, but there's a limit,” says Granados. ”We have a lot of our own poor people here . .. and they need help, too.”"
116598,172088,'The Light Between Oceans' Richly Illuminates A Couple's Moral Dilemma ,NPR,Andrew Lapin,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/09/01/492235353/the-light-between-oceans-richly-illuminates-a-couples-moral-dilemma,"Janus Island, despite its rocky hilltops, patches of farmland and ample beaches, can't be found on a map. That's because it doesn't exist. But to be fair to Janus, most   remote islands aren't easy to find on maps either, unless you know what you're looking for. The gorgeous new period drama The Light Between Oceans does know what it's looking for. Set on the fictitious Janus, which lies some distance from the Australian coast, the film understands the romance and the mystique that arises from picturesque isolation. Literature's greatest names have long routed their heroes to islands, and the movie demonstrates the setting's great durability. It builds a gripping morality play, with characters as fierce and hardened as the choppy waves that crash onto the shore from all directions. The lighthouse keeper on this godforsaken paradise is Tom, played by Michael Fassbender with tight lips and a weary stare. He's a stoic World War I veteran with no family and a fat ton of survivor's remorse. These qualities would seem to make him the ideal candidate for such a solitary gig, but lighthouse keepers, we're told, fare better when they have companions to help tend to the chores. (The previous one had conjured images of his dead wife to keep him company.) So it's good for work when Tom quickly falls for Isabel (Alicia Vikander) the pretty young woman in the closest port town who's OK with the isolation  —   and the broken piano in the keeper's house  —   but desperately wants a family. Two heartbreaking miscarriages follow, with silent funerals as the island wind rattles the plain wooden crosses. The edge of the world seems to reject all attempts to populate it. An unexpected gift soon washes ashore. It would be foolish to give away too much of what follows this divine intervention, but don't believe the ads for this movie billing it as a mere romance. Readers of the novel by M. L. Stedman, from which the film is adapted, will know what sorts of decisions await Tom and Isabel, both out on Janus where only God is around to judge, and back in town where the repercussions will grow over the years. The story is airtight, with not an action or background detail wasted. As a grieving mother on the mainland (Rachel Weisz) begins to factor into things, a fascinating spiritual element takes shape: What is the just and righteous decision, and what is the   decision, and what if they are secretly the same? The skill of the leads is such that we can ask these questions without straying too far from the film itself. Any number of readings are possible in the performances of the   perfectly cast Fassbender and Vikander, who each depict their characters as withdrawn even when they're being intimate, and who can open up deep rifts in their relationship without saying a word. At one crucial moment, Vikander lets out a scream of such primal fury, a wail of possession, that it shatters the bones. It's a selfish, even childlike reaction to something she herself did wrong, yet we never think of Isabel as a cheat. She's human, and her wounds are deep, and she's chosen the wrong way to fill them. Director Derek Cianfrance previously made Blue Valentine, a   tale of love gone wrong, and The Place Beyond the Pines, a   crime saga. In the past, he has favored an intense, often furious brand of imagery that uses showy technique to approximate deep human emotion without ever quite arriving at real humanity. (Feel Ryan Gosling's pain! Feel it!) But here, Cianfrance has found material that complements him well, because the   story forces him to put his visual style to good use. He does wonders with closeups from behind, in   profile, setting the relationships between his leads   in subtle ways. And because setting your movie on an island is a waste if you can't bathe everything in natural light, he turns the film (shot on Tasmania and New Zealand) into   playtime. The Light Between Oceans drifts   in the ending, which drags on for one epilogue too many and operates under the ancient Hollywood sailor's mistaken belief that a touch of schmaltz cures all wounds. Yet the film remains an uncharted island of gripping narrative power and visual splendor, beckoning us to dock at its shore."
116599,172089,FDA Fees On Industry Haven't Fixed Delays In Generic Drug Approvals,NPR,Sydney Lupkin,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/09/01/492235796/fda-fees-on-industry-havent-fixed-delays-in-generic-drug-approvals,"Consumers and lawmakers pushing for cheaper alternatives to the EpiPen, an antidote for   allergic reactions, and other   drugs are seeking answers about a stubborn backlog of generic drug applications at the Food and Drug Administration. Even after the agency started levying user fees on drugmakers in 2012 to pay for more people to review the medicines, the backlog of decisions still stretches almost four years. As of July 1, the FDA had 4, 036 generic drug applications awaiting approval, and the median time it takes for the FDA to approve a generic is now 47 months, according to the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, a trade group. The FDA has approved more generics in the past few years, but a flood of applications has added to the problem. By comparison, the European Medicines Agency, Europe's version of the FDA, has just 24 generics, including biologically based biosimilars awaiting approval. The FDA's generic count doesn't include biosimilars, which are more complicated medicines to review. The EMA along with the European Commission, which handles approval of marketing materials, are approving generics and   drugs in about a year on average, according to the EMA. Critics say getting generic alternatives to the U. S. market for products like EpiPen is still taking far too long. Other   drugs with rising prices and no generic competition have also drawn scrutiny, including Turing Pharmaceuticals' Daraprim, for toxoplasmosis, and Valeant's cardiovascular drugs Isuprel and Nitropress. Congress asks why generic version of EpiPens aren't available  ”We are concerned that Mylan (maker of the EpiPen) has not faced much competition for its product,” five U. S. senators wrote Aug. 24 to FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf, adding that one of EpiPen's nongeneric competitors,   was recalled in October, granting Mylan a near monopoly. ”News reports indicate that generic versions of the EpiPen have been subject to additional questioning by the FDA and have yet to be approved.” On Monday, three members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce wrote a similar letter to the FDA, seeking information about the EpiPen generic applications it has received and how they've been prioritized. When asked whether the FDA bears any responsibility for the lack of EpiPen competition, FDA spokesman Kristofer Baumgartner said he couldn't comment on pending applications or confirm their existence, citing confidentiality rules. But he stressed that the FDA pushes pending applications for drugs with no current generics to the front of the line and approved 580 generics in 2015, a record for the agency and 40 percent more than in 2014. ”The FDA is confident that the overall trend in actions on generic drug applications will be one of continuing improvement,” Baumgartner said. In March, generics giant Teva Pharmaceuticals told investors that its generic version of EpiPen was rejected by the FDA, and that it wouldn't be able to launch the generic until at least 2017. Adamis Pharmaceuticals reported a similar rejection from the FDA for its EpiPen generic in June. Mylan has said it will offer a $300 generic in the coming weeks. Because Mylan also makes the   product, it won't have to wait in line behind other pending generics. Dr. James Baker, the CEO and chief medical officer of the advocacy group Food Allergy and Research Education, said Mylan's move may deter other generic manufacturers from seeking approval. Adrenaclick is the only other epinephrine   on the market, but it isn't an exact generic of EpiPen and can't be swapped automatically at the pharmacy if a doctor has written a prescription for EpiPen. Adrenaclick also isn't widely available. ”You call up 100 pharmacies, and maybe 10 have the device, from what we gather,” Baker said of Adrenaclick. He said several factors have allowed EpiPen's price tag to swell over the years. Many patients were in the dark about EpiPen price increases until insurers started shifting more of the cost onto consumers a few years ago, and getting approval for a generic that's both a drug and a device is more complicated than getting approval for a drug alone, he said. Meanwhile, Mylan has aggressively marketed its product and raised doubts about alternatives.  And documents show that Mylan submitted a citizen petition to the FDA arguing that people trained to use EpiPens wouldn't be able to use Teva's pending generic epinephrine   because of design differences. ”Is Mylan doing anything illegal? No,” Baker said. ”It's taking advantage of all these things to take the market and basically push it to an extreme.” User fees levied to speed up the approval process, The FDA's generic backlog isn't a new problem. In 2012, it was so large that it prompted the government to start charging user fees to generic manufacturers to provide the funds for the FDA to speed the process. The fees built on the    Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which required   drugmakers to pay fees to expand FDA's capacity to review applications for those medicines. In the first three years, the FDA collected $1 billion from generic drug manufacturers. The fees were used to hire an additional 1, 000 employees, and put the Office of Generic Drugs on par with the Office of New Drugs by reorganizing it and moving it from four outlying buildings to the FDA's main campus in Silver Spring, Md. The funds were also used to upgrade the office's information technology. The FDA says on its website: ”Additional resources will enable the Agency to reduce a current backlog of pending applications, cut the average time required to review generic drug applications for safety, and increase   inspections.” In October 2012, there was a backlog of 2, 868 generic drugs awaiting approval, and the FDA said it would take a ”first action” on 90 percent of these drugs by 2017. This summer, the agency met its goal a year early, but a first action isn't an approval. Instead, it stops the review clock and puts the applications back in industry's court. Only 1, 551 generics have been approved since the fees on drugmakers were initiated, and that total includes some extra applications that weren't considered part of the official backlog. So, all told, the agency has only approved about half of the backlogged generics that were awaiting approval in 2012. ”Most applications from the backlog will need to come back to FDA for additional review due to deficiencies in the submissions, before approval is possible,” the agency said in a statement in responses to questions. David Gaugh, senior vice president for science and regulatory affairs at the Generic Pharmaceuticals Association, said standards used to compile generic applications when they were submitted three or four years ago have changed while the applications were sitting in the backlog. So when the FDA got back to those companies, it said the applications were of ”poor quality.” The applications for generic drugs have continued to pile up even as the FDA approved a record number of generics in 2015 and again in the first seven months of 2016. The number of generic drug applications tripled from 2002 to 2012, according to January congressional testimony  from Janet Woodcock, who directs the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Still, some see signs the agency is on the right track. ”I think that it is an optimistic picture overall . .. at the FDA, there's been a lot of progress, and I think there is more to be made,” said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, an interdisciplinary drug researcher at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. ”This is not something that people should think has been solved at this point. It's totally an ongoing process.” Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.

116600,172090,A Paralympian Cyclist Gears Up For Rio  ,NPR,Esther Ciammachilli,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetorch/2016/09/01/492223434/a-paralympian-cyclist-gears-up-for-rio,"On a muggy afternoon in Atlanta, Jennifer Schuble, 40, hops on her bicycle and clips into the pedals. She zooms around the steep banks of a velodrome. She drafts behind her coach, who's on a motorcycle, holding the pace steady at 30 miles per hour. The Olympics are over in Rio, which means it's now time for the 2016 Paralympic Games, which begin Wednesday in the Brazilian city. There have been issues in the   to the Paralympics, with organizers announcing some cutbacks due to funding shortages. But thousands of athletes will be there as planned. The USA is sending almost 300 para athletes, including Schuble, who won a gold and two silver medals in Beijing eight years ago, while taking a silver and a bronze in London in 2012. At just    Schuble is short for a cyclist, but she has explosive power. She displays no outward signs of a disability at first glance. Schuble, who lives and trains in Birmingham, Ala. grew up playing soccer and running track. Then a series of accidents beginning in 1997 changed her life. It started when Schuble attended the U. S. Military Academy at West Point. ”I was in a hand to hand combat class and I did a flip and landed on my head,” she said. ”I ended up with a concussion [and] my neck had four partially bulged discs.” That's when she suffered her first traumatic brain injury, or TBI. She began to struggle  —   both academically and physically  —   and withdrew from West Point. A few years later, Schuble was in a car accident that resulted in a second TBI. Then in 2004, doctors diagnosed her with multiple sclerosis. At that point, she said, ”What next?”  Schuble says her biggest physical ailments are because of MS. ”MS is like an old house ” she said. ”So when your core body temperature gets hotter as in when you're exercising . .. you start misfiring. Your brain stops communicating. So, as an athlete that makes it harder.” When her body temperature rises she loses feeling in her feet, which makes running almost impossible. But on a bike, her feet lock into the pedals and her legs do the work. Schuble says cycling helps to keep her MS at bay and she constantly pushes the limits despite her disability. Paralympic athletes are divided into groups based on physical ability. Schuble competes with athletes who have mild physical impairments. Back in 2008, she came out of nowhere to break the world record in the women's 500 meters in Beijing. ”That was just a huge moment because I don't think anyone in that arena thought I'd win the 500 and break the world record,” said Schuble. ”And for me to actually pull that off and actually do the start that I did, it was huge.” She came close to winning gold again in London in 2012, but had to settle for an individual silver and a team bronze. That gave her a renewed purpose and fueled her quest to once again be the top Paralympic cyclist on the podium, this time in Rio."

C. We spent the last year talking with them about their choice of public, private or community college. Was the cost worth it? What is the value of higher education? It turns out they're all satisfied customers. And among the most important subjects they report learning a lot about was themselves. Reconciling their plans and dreams with real life. "
116602,172092,Georgetown Will Offer An Edge In Admissions To Descendants Of Slaves ,NPR,Camila Domonoske,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/01/492223040/georgetown-will-offer-an-edge-in-admissions-to-descendants-of-slaves,"Georgetown University will be offering an admissions edge to descendants of enslaved people sold to fund the school, officials announced on Thursday. Jesuit priests connected to the private Catholic university sold 272 enslaved people in 1838, to pay off the university's massive debts. The men, women and children were sold to plantations in Louisiana the university received the equivalent of $3. 3 million, securing its survival. A working group, created last year to explore Georgetown's historical ties to slavery, says even more slaves might have been sold in the 1830s to keep the school afloat. And the school's connection to slavery is both broader and deeper than the one   sale. Georgetown was supported by the plantations of Jesuit priests in Maryland hundreds of people were enslaved by those Jesuits. An ”unknown number” of other enslaved people worked in or for the school, the working group says. In their report, made public Thursday, the working group says much more research is needed to fill in gaps in the historical record. They also call for a formal apology from the university for the school's ”historical relationship with slavery.” And, the report suggests, the school should give descendants of people owned by the Maryland Jesuits ”an advantage in the admissions process.” On Thursday, the university announced it would be doing just that  —   specifically, by treating the descendants of those enslaved people the same way it treats legacy students, applicants whose family members attended Georgetown. The working group had also recommended that Georgetown explore the feasibility of offering financial assistance for those students as well. The university did not mention scholarships or financial aid for descendants of the enslaved. Additionally, the school will be renaming two buildings  —   formerly named after the two university presidents who made the arrangements to sell slaves to fund the school. The buildings had been temporarily renamed to Freedom Hall and Memorial Hall while waiting for their final names. One will become Isaac Hall, after one of the enslaved men who was sold in 1838, and another Anne Marie Becraft Hall, after a black educator and nun. ”We hope that the two buildings will stand as a reminder of how our University community disregarded the high values of human dignity and education when it came to the plight of enslaved and free African Americans in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,” the working group wrote in its report. Georgetown will also establish a memorial to the people whose enslavement funded and built the school, offer a mass of reconciliation and work to promote scholarship in the field of racial justice, it says. Universities across the country have recently been grappling with their historical ties to slavery and slaveowners  —   along with the contemporary problems of racism and racial inequity, frequently the subject of campus protests. But Georgetown's step, to consider the enslavement of ancestors as part of the admissions process, may be unprecedented, The NY Times reports. The Times  —   which published a lengthy report on Georgetown's legacy of slavery this spring  —   spoke to a historian named Craig Steven Wilder who said he knew of no other school that had offered that kind of preferential admission status. Wilder also cautioned, the Times reports, ”that the significance of such a gesture would rest heavily on the degree to which Georgetown invested in outreach to descendants, including identifying them, making sure they are aware of the benefit's existence and actively recruiting them to the university.” Georgetown says that it will ”deepen archival resources to support genealogical work” and establish a new institute to research slavery and engage with descendants. The Georgetown Memory Project, an independent group, is currently working to identify descendants of those sold in 1838 to fund Georgetown. Richard Cellini, the founder of that project, told the student newspaper at Georgetown, that statistical models suggest up to 12, 000 to 15, 000 descendants may be living. If you count other people enslaved by Georgetown's Jesuits  —   including some who were never sold, but lived on campus  —   there may be more than 20, 000 descendants, the student newspaper reports. You can read the full report from the working group below, and the statement from the university here. You can also explore the history of slavery at Georgetown at the Georgetown Slavery Archive, an online repository of primary source documents. The university's president, John DeGioia, is expected to speak at Georgetown at 4 p. m. ET on Thursday the event will be streamed on Georgetown's website."
116603,172093,How GMOs Cut The Use Of Pesticides — And Perhaps Boosted It Again,NPR,Dan Charles,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/09/01/492091546/how-gmos-cut-the-use-of-pesticides-and-perhaps-boosted-them-again,"In the ferocious, sprawling brawl over genetically modified crops, one particular question seems like it should have a simple factual answer: Did those crops lead to more use of pesticides, or less? Sadly, there's no simple answer. Pesticides include both insecticides and herbicides. Backers of GMOs point to the example of crops containing new genes that fight off insect pests, so farmers don't have to spray insecticides. Biotech critics point to the example of crops that have been altered to tolerate specific weedkillers, like glyphosate, thus encouraging farmers to rely more heavily on those herbicides. This week, scientists at Iowa State made a fresh attempt to answer this question. It's based on the most detailed data ever assembled to examine the issue. Those data came from a private company, which gathered information about the farm practices of 5, 000 randomly selected farmers who grew corn and soybeans, the two most widely planted crops in the country. That information allowed detailed comparisons of pesticide use on fields planted with GMO corn and soybeans, compared to   fields. Unfortunately, this study probably won't settle the debate. It's that complicated. One of the study's conclusions is straightforward and difficult to dispute. Genetically modified,   corn has allowed farmers to reduce their use of insecticides to fight the corn rootworm and the European corn borer. There is, however, concern that this effect won't last. Corn rootworms have evolved resistance to one of the genes that has been deployed against them. When it comes to weedkillers, though, the picture gets more murky. For one thing, the effect of GMOs has been different in corn than in soybeans. Farmers who switched to   corn also switched herbicides, and used less total herbicide than farmers did on conventional corn  —   for a while. In the years since 2007, however,   corn got sprayed with more weedkillers, as measured in kilograms per acre, than corn without that GMO trait. Farmers who are growing genetically modified,   soybeans, meanwhile, have been using more weedkillers than their   neighbors. In fact, that gap has been widening in recent years. Edward Perry of Kansas State University, a   of the new study, which appears in the journal Science Advances, says farmers may be using more herbicides on   crops in recent years because they have to fight off an increasing number of weeds that have evolved to become resistant to glyphosate. Complicating the picture, however, is the fact that the war on weeds involves many different herbicides, and they vary tremendously in their environmental effects. The new study tries to account for that by comparing the ”environmental impact quotient,” or EIQ, of the herbicides sprayed on each field, in addition to their weight. But Andrew Kniss, a weed scientist at the University of Wyoming, says the EIQ falls woefully short as a measure of real environmental impact. ”Toxicity can vary by a factor of 10 or a hundred,” he says. The EIQ doesn't come anywhere close to capturing those large differences among chemicals, he says. Much better, he says, is a ”risk quotient” measure that's used by the EPA. ”It is, frankly, disappointing to see continued use of the EIQ in the   literature,” Kniss wrote in an email to The Salt. Kniss says the EIQ is such a crude measure that this study can't convincingly show whether GMO crops have been helpful or harmful to the environment. So the debate continues."

The singer, who died Sunday, was practically a household name throughout the   world, but his death caused hardly a blip of recognition among most of those who'd tuned in to MTV's Video Music Awards the night of his death. That's what Alt. Latino is for. For this week's episode, we gathered a few folks to come play some of their favorite Juan Gabriel tracks  —   not only to mourn his death, but also to unpack his immense popularity and success. As you'll hear, the answers are both complex and simple, much like JuanGa's cultural impact. Once you get an idea of why he was such a big deal, I think you may agree that in an age when music fans often listen only to what they already like, we may never see another performer have this kind of personal impact on so many people."
116605,172095,SpaceX Rocket And Its Cargo Explode On Launch Pad In Florida [VIDEO],NPR,Bill Chappell,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/01/492230187/spacex-launch-pad-in-florida-is-scene-of-large-explosion-days-before-launch,"Two days before SpaceX was to launch a communications satellite that would widen Internet access in Africa, an unmanned rocket and its payload were destroyed in an explosion on a launch pad in Cape Canaveral, Fla. Smoke billowed from the pad where the   satellite was to be launched Saturday morning. A ”significant explosion” hit the launch area early Thursday, the 45th Space Wing at Cape Canaveral Air Station tells member station WMFE's Brendan Byrne. It said no casualties were reported and that there was no threat to the public's safety. SpaceX says ”an anomaly on the pad” caused the explosion. Disaster struck as workers at the launch pad prepared for a test firing of the rocket. The explosion occurred as the rocket was being filled with propellant, says SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who adds in a tweet that the blast originated near the upper stage oxygen tank. You can see the blast for yourself, thanks to a veterans group that had a camera trained on the space vehicle this morning. The explosion comes shortly after the 1:10 mark. The launch, which had been planned for 3 a. m. ET Saturday, was significant for a number of reasons. The payload included a communications satellite meant to provide direct Internet access to large and remote swaths of   Africa, in a program led by Facebook that also includes Eutelsat and Spacecom, the Israeli company that made the   satellite. After the loss of the rocket and its payload, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg posted an update from Africa to say he is ”deeply disappointed to hear that SpaceX's launch failure destroyed our satellite that would have provided connectivity to so many entrepreneurs and everyone else across the continent.” Zuckerberg added that his company has other technologies in the works, ”and we will keep working until everyone has the opportunities this satellite would have provided.” The explosion follows a run of recent successes for SpaceX, including landing part of its Falcon 9 rocket on a floating barge as another stage continued into space. But there have been setbacks  —   including a rocket that exploded as it attempted to land on a barge in January, and another rocket that blew up shortly after takeoff last summer. This is a breaking news story, and we'll update this post with reliable information as it emerges."
116606,172096,One Result Of China's Buildup In South China Sea: Environmental Havoc,NPR,Jackie Northam,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/09/01/491395715/one-result-of-chinas-buildup-in-south-china-sea-environmental-havoc,"Just over a month ago, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague issued two important rulings. One soundly rejected Beijing's extensive claim of sovereignty in the South China Sea. The other focused on whether China had caused environmental damage as it constructed artificial islands in the region to help prop up its claim. The South China Sea's disputed waters are claimed by seven countries, and The Hague rulings came in response to a case brought against China by the Philippines. China dismissed The Hague's decision as ”nothing but a scrap of paper.” But Kent Carpenter, a professor of biological science at Old Dominion University and an expert witness for the tribunal, says The Hague tribunal's findings were nothing short of damning. ”The tribunal clearly decided that China had caused severe harm to the coral reef environment,” he says. China also violated its obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ”to preserve and protect fragile ” he says. The tribunal found that damage to the coral reefs in the Spratly Islands is extensive, spreading for more than 30 square miles. Much of that damage is caused by China's    —   turning pristine reefs into permanent military outposts that include massive runways. John McManus, a professor of marine ecology at the University of Miami, says the Chinese use huge dredgers to pull up sand and anything else in their way. ”They're using a grinding ball,” he says. ”It's got grooves and teeth and it spins around and tears up living coral and parts of the coral reef substrate, to make more gravel and sand to be sucked up and used for  .” The dredgers also create plumes of sediment, McManus says. When it lands, the sediment smothers coral, fish, whole marine ecosystems. He says this has been devastating to one of the world's most biodiverse regions. ”We're talking about some of the highest diversity in the world,” he says. ”You may have 70 species of coral, roughly, in the Caribbean, about 70 or so in Hawaii  —   but here, we're talking well over 400 species of coral. And it's the same ratios for fish and invertebrates.” However destructive the   is, it's nothing compared to the damage done by the poaching of giant clams, says Carpenter. Chinese fishermen have been destroying entire reefs, he says, by using propellers to try to dredge up and harvest the clams, which appear on the IUCN Red List as a ”vulnerable” species. The fishers anchor a boat, rev up the engine and swing the propeller from side to side, he says. ”The action of the propeller basically uncovers and breaks up all of the coral, so that the giant clams are basically easy to extract,” he says. Carpenter says The Hague tribunal found the Chinese government had essentially turned a blind eye to the poaching of giant clams. The poachers' actions help China back up its claim that it's only building artificial islands on dead coral reefs, not living ones, McManus says. ”So in a way,” he says, ”China is not lying, they're telling the truth. They actually built on dead coral  —   because the Chinese fishers had already killed the coral.” Beijing has recently started cracking down on the poachers, he says. But Edgardo Gomez, a marine biologist at the University of the Philippines, says it may be too late. ”There are    species of giant clams in the world that are within that area,” he says, ”and all of the living clams plus the shells have been virtually wiped out of the South China Sea.” The Philippines tried restocking, but the clams were wiped out again. China was invited to  —   but did not  —   provide evidence to The Hague tribunal to back up its claims that it had done extensive environmental studies before constructing islands in the South China Sea. Carpenter says there's concern China will continue to build up islands and destroy the environment. ”If it does, then it will begin to lose all of its credibility with regard to its own international obligations,” he says. Even if China were to abandon the artificial islands, he warns, the environment in the area could take decades  —   if ever  —   to recover. Tearing down the islands at this point, he says, isn't the answer, either, and would cause more damage than has already been done."
116607,172097,Your Dilapidated Barn Is Super Trendy. Just Ask HGTV,NPR,Kristofor Husted,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/09/01/492117376/your-dilapidated-barn-is-super-trendy-just-ask-hgtv,"Larry Gerdes is having his barn taken down and disassembled in Malta Bend, Mo. It's about the size of a   garage but stands much taller in a clearing surrounded by   stalks of corn. The barn's exterior is graying, part of its roof is missing, and there's a gaping hole looking out from the hayloft. It's about 100 years old, and it's not really useful. ”It's deteriorated and it would cost a lot of money to repair it,” Gerdes says. ”And it doesn't fit into modern farming. Unless you got two cows to let them loaf inside, nothing fits, and it's just obsolete.” While a quaint wooden barn lost in a field of greening corn is a classic farm country tableau, for modern farmers, many of these aging barns have lost their purpose. The barns can't fit today's giant tractors and are too small to house the larger herds of cattle or hogs. While the dilapidated barn might be a nuisance for farmers, reclaimed barn wood is a hot decorating trend from Manhattan to Manhattan Beach. Turn on HGTV, and you'll see people asking for reclaimed barn wood on many of their shows, including Fixer Upper. Using barn wood is so popular right now, it even has its own slot on the DIY Network  —   a show hosted by Mark Bowe called ”Barnwood Builders.” Old barn wood is called a lot of things in the construction business, like reclaimed, salvaged or repurposed. For 20 years, Bowe has been taking old barns apart. He says his customers are interested in what's called ”upcycling”  —   taking undesirable or waste materials and creatively reusing them. The barn siding he sells can turn into brewery bars or restaurant tables. ”Most people want those accent pieces,” he says. ”They want to have those pretty beams in the ceiling or they want to have the barn wood walls, or the tables and the furniture.” A few years ago, many farmers didn't understand how valuable their old barns were and might have been swindled, Bowe says, but today they know the capital they're sitting on. He says we're in the midst of a barn wood frenzy right now, but it still likely has a shelf life. Indeed, there are only so many weathered barns in the U. S. ”This is a finite resource,” he says, ”so it seems like every building we take down, we deplete our livelihood.” A tableau tradeoff, With every barn that comes down, the classic landscape of American farmland littered with wooden barns fades away. The National Barn Alliance is trying to make sure that doesn't happen by preserving the buildings it can and documenting those that will come down. ”Preservation in the past has really sought to preserve the great, grand mansions of important white men, but we're so far beyond that now as a discipline,” says Danae Peckler, an architectural historian with the alliance. ”We start to look at average landscapes that really tell the American story. And the farm is one of those.” Peckler says she understands the big changes happening in agriculture, and accompanying modern barns, but she hopes people at least take photos and write down the barn's history before salvaging it for parts and selling them. ”It makes me a little sad, but it also makes me a little excited,” Peckler says. ”It makes me think that we're realizing this has a cultural resonance with us.” The barns have sentimental value to many people. Mark Bowe knows this. ”We are changing the landscape for our future generations by removing these barns, and it is a bittersweet living for me,” he says. ”When we salvage barns for parts, we always take down the ones we know won't be standing in 15 years.” Preserving a barn's history, Mike Hudson hasn't been in the business as long as Bowe, but says he feels the same way. ”Sometimes it's not real exciting taking it down, because you understand the history behind the barn,” Hudson says. Hudson's business also deconstructs old barns,   the pieces and then sells them to contractors or designers. They'll use it for flooring, furniture and accent walls. And while he has acquired some barns for free, he has also paid up to $1, 000 for one. ”There's a lot of expense involved that people don't quite understand,” he says. ”Even if you got a free barn, it's not necessarily free. We spend an average of about $500 a day in bringing one of these down respectfully.” Hudson and his team were hired by Larry Gerdes in central Missouri to pull apart the barn by hand, using hammers and crowbars. It will take about two weeks to take Gerdes' barn down, Hudson says. In the end, he'll sell the wood for between $5 and $10 a square foot, depending on species, size and condition. Black walnut, red oak and chestnut are some of the more expensive species, he says. ”This is it. This is what I have a passion for,” he says. ”And if you can find that passion, that's what you stick with. It's not always about the money.” Hudson says he has an immense respect for the crafting and history of old barns. He takes photos to share with the owners and always asks about the history of the farm. ”That's the thing we take into consideration when we come in, because we're just as passionate about bringing it down properly [and] respectfully as the pioneers were back then to build it,” he says. So what happens when the barn wood trend fizzles out? Mark Bowe says look for people trying to repurpose material from a different era. ”Maybe we start to see more factory beams incorporated,” he says. ”The story becomes less about the early pioneer and more about the industrial age, with large factory timbers and factory floors.” This story comes to us from Harvest Public Media, a reporting collaboration focused on food and agriculture."
116608,172098,How U.S. Businesses In Europe Are Already Planning For Brexit,NPR,Frank Langfitt,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/09/01/492142750/for-u-s-businesses-brexit-leads-to-uncertainty-and-worry,"As part of the project A Nation Engaged, NPR and member stations are exploring America's role in the world heading into the presidential election. The United Kingdom's planned split from the EU is expected to take years, but it's already creating uncertainty for multinational companies operating in the U. K. including many American firms. Brexit also poses challenges to the U. S. government, as Washington ponders a future in which a key ally has less influence in Europe and likely becomes less relevant on the global stage. Even before the June referendum, American and other financial firms were looking beyond the City of London  —   the Wall   at the core of Britain's capital  —   for new office space in Europe. Meanwhile, U. S. automakers are anticipating sizable financial hits from the decision to leave the EU. ”We see the impact on Ford of being somewhere in the range of $400 to $500 million each year,” said Bob Shanks, Ford's chief financial officer, on an investor call earlier this summer. General Motors says it is cutting worker hours in German factories because it expects less demand for cars in Great Britain following the June Brexit vote. The car companies also worry that new tariffs could hurt the competitiveness of their U. K. factories. The U. K.'s auto business, which is seen as very successful, sends more than half of its exports to the EU. ”It's vital for our U. K. automotive manufacturing, and for our huge retail market here that we secure unfettered access to European markets,” says Tamzen Isacsson, director of communications with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a U. K. industry group. If not, that could make it harder for auto plants in the U. K. to win future work. Plants routinely compete within companies for the opportunity to build new models, but because cars are built on   to   product plans, the June vote is not expected to have an immediate impact on which models are built there. ”The big issues are going to be   models coming up for renewal during the period of uncertainty,” says Graham Armitage, an auto analyst for KPMG. For instance, if it costs 10 percent extra to export a car from the U. K. into Europe after Brexit, Armitage says that could make building some models in the U. K. unprofitable. ”You're talking about tens of thousands of jobs that could be affected,” Armitage says. ”No one would say that all of those decisions will go against the U. K. but they're going to be tougher decisions than they would otherwise have been.” The British auto industry does have something in its favor: The United Kingdom is an attractive export market. Germany sends about 800, 000 cars a year to the U. K. and doesn't want retaliatory tariffs. Armitage says there are incentives for both sides to make a deal on market access. Relocations as   rights vanish, The outlook for the financial industry is a bit darker. Currently, firms in the City of London can freely offer a variety of financial services throughout the EU under what are called ”passporting” rights. Many analysts expect at least some of those rights will disappear after Brexit. Even before the June vote, JPMorgan Chase  Co. chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon warned company workers in the U. K. that he might have to send some of their jobs to mainland Europe. ”Today we can service EU companies here, freely  —   with systems, technology, research, investment banking,” Dimon told employees at JPMorgan's office in the city of Bournemouth, on the English Channel. ”After a Brexit, we cannot do it all here. And we will have to start planning for that. I don't know if it means 1, 000 jobs, 2, 000 jobs  —   it could be as many as 4, 000.” Andrew Gray, a partner with PricewaterhouseCoopers, which advises investment banks, insurance companies and other firms on Brexit planning, says some companies are considering moving some operations to EU cities ranging from Dublin and Amsterdam to Paris and Luxembourg. But he says such moves are hugely complicated, because London offers so many financial support services and already has a very talented labor pool. ”A number of banks have estimated [that] to replicate even part of their infrastructure in Europe could take between five and 10 years,” says Gray. ”You have to be looking at real estate as an option,” adds Gray, who says companies will have to look for areas with appropriate schools, housing and financial expertise. ”There is only a finite supply of suitable real estate in a number of these locations.” A   relationship? As for the U. S. government, Brexit is a deep disappointment. During a visit to London last spring, Obama urged voters to cast their ballots in favor of staying in the EU  —   not just for economic reasons, but political as well. The U. S. traditionally has seen Great Britain as a valuable ally in many respects, including in pressing its interests with the EU. Washington also has struggled for years on an EU trade deal known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which it hoped would bind the U. S. and its allies more closely. Anand Menon, a professor of European politics at Kings College, says a united Europe that shares democratic values is a valuable asset for the U. S. as it tries to deal with the rise and growing influence of an authoritarian China. ”People in Washington will be slightly worried at the notion that a key ally like the United Kingdom is peeling itself off from the European bloc,” says Menon. Menon, incidentally, doesn't think that's actually the case  —   but acknowledges that it's the perception."

However, you can still listen with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. From breakups to moves to midlife crises, major change has done wonders for the creative process. For Okkervil River   Will Sheff, there's no hiding the impact of transition on his new album, which goes so far as to open with a track titled ”Okkervil River R. I. P.” Referencing several deaths  —   those of Sheff's grandfather, three members of the RB group The Force MDs, and singer Judee Sill  —   the song takes a plaintive, deliberately paced ramble through a life of wonder, regret and bad behavior, peppered with notes of hope. Given the tumult in Sheff's own life, it's no surprise that he chose to examine big changes when putting together the songs on Away. The band's entire lineup has turned over since the release of 2013's   The Silver Gymnasium, for starters, while other industry contacts disappeared. He'd recently lost the aforementioned grandfather, his idol. Away is a       kind of record  —   it even features cover art by someone other than Will Schaff, whose artwork helped define albums like Black Sheep Boy and The Stage Names  —   and Sheff uses the occasion to take his time and let his songs breathe. Sheff recorded Away with an assortment of his favorite musicians, including Marissa Nadler, members of yMusic and his old Okkervil River bandmate Jonathan Meiburg, with whom he formed Shearwater 15 years ago. But all together, they still keep a relatively tight focus on the singer's many words, which unfurl in alternately cryptic, nonlinear and revealing fashion. Given the subject matter that informs and inspires it, Away can't help but feel mournful, but with   of its songs running past six and a half minutes, it's also stuffed with ideas and experimentation. For Sheff's closing statement, ”Days Spent Floating (In The Halfbetween),” the singer says he spent a month transcribing the first sentence that popped into his head each day  —   a process that yielded thoughts on travel, death, Halloween and ways to get through life. (”You can only spend so much time, brother, as the world's guest. ”) The song ably mirrors the sort of purge that often accompanies rebirth, and it's a testament to Sheff's considerable gifts that it sounds as graceful and evocative as it does."
116610,172100,POLL: Most Americans Want Congress To Make Zika Funding A High Priority,NPR,Alison Kodjak,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/09/01/492103236/poll-most-americans-want-congress-to-make-zika-funding-a-high-priority,"Summer is winding down, but when members of Congress return to Washington from their vacations next week, many of their constituents want them to do something about the mosquitoes  —   the ones carrying Zika virus, to be specific. A new survey shows that three quarters of Americans say Congress should make the allocation of more money to deal with the Zika outbreaks in Florida and Puerto Rico an ”important” or ”top priority” when they return to Washington. ”People generally do value spending money when there is sort of a public health emergency,” says Mollyann Brodie, executive director of public opinion and survey research at the Kaiser Family Foundation, which conducted the survey. About half those surveyed said they'd be uncomfortable traveling to the areas of Florida where people have been infected by Zika. And 77 percent said pregnant woman are not safe in those areas. ”It is something that the local officials have to take really seriously,” Brodie says, ”because in many of those areas the tourism industry is a big part of those communities.” Obama asked for $1. 9 billion in emergency federal funding back in February to fight Zika. So far, Congress hasn't allocated anything. So the administration has been using money shifted from other accounts  —   including money that had been specified for studying and fighting Ebola, and for   emergency preparedness  —   to address the Zika threat, instead. Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, says his agency will be out of funds to fight Zika by the end of the month. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell issued a similar warning in August. But Mark Harkins, a senior fellow at Georgetown University's Government Affairs Institute, says that  —   at least technically  —   the Obama administration could move even more money from other programs to fight Zika. Even though lawmakers usually allocate money for specific purposes, the federal budget allows for some shifting of funds, Harkins says. ”As part of the appropriations bills themselves there's always a provision that says you may transfer money or reprogram money, based on certain levels,” he says. ”And then they put in a little out that says, you can move money at any point, at any amount, as long as you give 15 days notice.” Some lawmakers seem to be daring the administration to do just that. Senators Charles Grassley,   and James Lankford,   wrote a letter to Burwell, dated Aug. 26, that pointed to $20 billion that is sitting unspent in the HHS and State Department budgets. It could be spent on Zika, the senators say. Lankford's staff provided NPR with a list of the accounts the letter refers to. They included Food and Drug Administration salaries and expenses, the State Department's diplomatic and consular programs and programs in nonproliferation and  . The Senators simply added up all the money that remains unspent in the accounts Obama specified as needing additional funds, Harkins says. Grassley ”doesn't care that that money is supposed to be used for multiple different things,” says Harkins. ”He's just saying, 'If you think money should come out of that account, take any money that's left in that account. '” Meanwhile, as the White House and Congress debate the budget, state health officials are scrambling. Frank Welch, the head of community preparedness at Louisiana's health department, says his federal grant to prepare for all kinds of health emergencies was cut, and replaced with money that can only be used for Zika. ”But none of those other threats or emergencies that are very real possibilities have gone away,” he says, ”and we took about a $700, 000 dollar cut.” Louisiana is using the Zika money for mosquito control, to do public outreach and education about how to recognize and prevent infection. The state is also updating its lab to be able to do Zika testing. Welch says they've done a good job with prevention and preparedness, but there just isn't enough money left to deal with a Zika response if there's an outbreak in that state."
116611,172102,S. Korea's Hit Zombie Film Is Also A Searing Critique Of Korean Society,NPR,Elise Hu,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/09/01/492185811/s-koreas-hit-zombie-film-is-also-searing-critique-of-korean-society,"A zombie flick is smashing box office records in South Korea. Train to Busan has been seen by an estimated 11 million Koreans  —   a fifth of the population  —   and broken numerous records, including the highest   ticket sales in Korean film history. The plot isn't complicated: Everyday South Koreans find themselves trapped on a speeding bullet train with   zombies, creating the kind of claustrophobic feel that freshens up the zombie trope. But beyond a   summer thriller, it's also an extended critique of Korean society. ”We don't trust anyone but ourselves,” says film critic Youn   who writes for the Busan Daily.  Without giving too much of the story away, the film blames corporate callousness for the death toll. The government covers up the truth  —   or is largely absent. And the crew? Rather than rescue passengers, it follows the wishes of a businessman. In the film, those in charge  —   and the media —   ”are easily manipulated by others,” Youn says, which she said is a message the film's director was sending about the institutions here. These themes are particularly resonant in South Korea, which in 2014 faced national tragedy after 300 people, mostly teenagers, died when a ferry overturned in the sea. Investigators found the ferry's corporate owners overloaded it to save money. And the captain and crew got into lifeboats without rescuing passengers. News media, toeing the government line, originally reported that everyone survived. The Korean president's whereabouts on that day are still unexplained. ”After that accident, we have big trauma,” Youn says. It didn't let up. Last year, as Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, spread in South Korea, the government didn't disclose key information about where patients were being treated and how officials would contain the outbreak, instead demanding that people trust them. Outside a screening of Train to Busan in Seoul's Yongsan district,   like Wonwoo Park say they get it. ”Korea changed a lot in the last few years. We have to recognize we are pretty selfish,” he says. ”And we have to change.” While the message is clear, it's also just a fun summer flick, which probably explains its success more than its take on Korean society. ”The movie was the first made in Korea about zombies,”   Sharon Cho says. ”And the actors were good.” Haeryun Kang contributed to this story."
116631,172125,"Review: Teenage Fanclub, 'Here'",NPR,Jason Heller,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/09/01/491518447/first-listen-teenage-fanclub-here,"Note: NPR's First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. It's been a long road for Teenage Fanclub since its masterpiece, Bandwagonesque, famously beat out Nirvana's Nevermind to be named 1991's best album by Spin. After Bandwagonesque solidified the Scottish band's jangly,   pop sound, Teenage Fanclub gracefully began releasing a string of   many were hits in the U. K. but few made much of an impact in the States. Which is ironic: Ever since Bandwagonesque, the group has been refining a stew of influences that skew strongly American, from The Byrds to The Beach Boys to Buffalo Springfield to Big Star  —   a ringing paean to the power of massive hooks and   vibes. Here is Teenage Fanclub's 10th   album  —   the first since 2010's gorgeous Shadows  —   and it doesn't stray from the fold as it oozes melancholy melodies, dreamy contemplation and pure pop. ”I'm In Love” doesn't pull any romantic punches, punctuating its propulsive rhythm with guitarist Norman Blake's wispy vocals and   lyrics: ”It feels good when you're close to me   That's enough, that's enough   We will fade into history   I'm in love with you, love.” He's just as pensive in ”Connected To Life,” a subdued and atmospheric affair in which he whispers  —   in a voice unapologetically reminiscent of Roger McGuinn's  —   ”Once in a while I can see you, looking so young in your eyes   My darling, I just want to see you connected to life.” As usual, Teenage Fanclub divides its songwriting duties. Blake, guitarist Raymond McGinley and bassist Gerard Love contribute equally to the composition of Here, with each founding member writing and singing four songs. For his part, McGinley provides tracks like the ghostly ”Steady State,” a shimmering   hymn to cosmic empathy: ”One voice in the universe, she don't need prophecies to guide her   Sit down by the fireside, I feel the energy inside her.” It's as hippie as the band has ever gotten, but executed with hushed grace and winning earnestness. There's still plenty of Teenage Fanclub's patented   to be had, too  —   most spectacularly in Love's ”Thin Air,” an Alex   rush of distorted,   riffs and   desperation. The album does tinker here and there with the    Teenage Fanclub formula, if ever so gently. Sung by McGinley, ”I Was Beautiful When I was Alive” channels Neil Young's rootsy shuffle while summoning a hypnotic,         pulse. It also encapsulates the album's embrace of life's mysteries, which, as Love acknowledges, only deepen with age: ”Gonna close my eyes   Sail on through imagination   Don't expect no explanation.” Poignant and bittersweet, Here is a record about things slipping away and being clutched tighter as a result. ”Simple pleasures are all we need,” McGinley sings with gentle wisdom in ”Hold On.” When it comes to Here, that sentiment might as well be Teenage Fanclub's mantra."
118638,174612,5 Fact Checks From Trump's Cincinnati 'Thank-You Tour' Kickoff,NPR,Danielle Kurtzleben,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/12/02/504146253/5-fact-checks-from-trumps-cincinnati-thank-you-tour-kick-off,"Trump kicked off his postelection ”thank you tour” with a   rally that sounded a lot like any of his campaign rallies. He said trade was dangerous, he warned about refugees, and his mention of his former opponent, Clinton, prompted supporters to chant ”lock her up.” As was the case at many times on the campaign trail, Trump's presentation of facts requires some   and context. Here's a look at the  's   speech. ”We'll compete in the world. We want to compete in the world. But we're going to compete in the world where it's a   road not a   road. The advantages are going to come back to our country, and they haven't for many many years.” It's hard to call trade a ”  road” for the U. S. The U. S. has received lots of advantages from trade, although many of those benefits are hard to see. It's a point economists generally agree on: In a 2012 survey, 85 percent of top economists agreed that ”freer trade improves productive efficiency and offers consumers better choices, and in the long run these gains are much larger than any effects on employment.” Likewise, 85 percent also agreed that ”on average, citizens of the U. S. have been better off with the North American Free Trade Agreement” than they would have been without it  —   and as he did often during the campaign, Trump continued to slam NAFTA Thursday night. But what's important is that those economists were speaking in the aggregate  —   they were talking about Americans altogether getting their goods more cheaply and having a better standard of living, for example. Particular Americans are still worse off because of trade deals. When a U. S. factory moves overseas, it leaves the Americans who worked there jobless. It doesn't mean trade is bad, but it does mean that it doesn't benefit everyone equally and does indeed hurt some people. ”A shrinking workforce and flat wages are not the new normal. And we're not even talking about flat. . .. Some of you in this audience [of] hardworking incredible Americans were making more money 20 years ago than you're making today.” This one we can take piece by piece. For starters, the workforce is growing (in raw numbers). Presumably, Trump is referring to the ”labor force participation rate,” which he also referenced sometimes on the campaign trail. That is smaller than it used to be, though it has leveled off recently . .. and either way, the falling rate is not entirely a bad thing. The labor force participation rate measures the share of people 16 and older who either have work or are looking for work. After years of decline, the figure has stabilized in the past year or so. Some of that decline wasn't good  —   that is, it reflected people getting discouraged and giving up on the job search. However, some of the decline reflects demographic realities  —   in this case, the fact that baby boomers have started edging into retirement. That's not a bad thing. As for the wages part, it's true that many Americans aren't earning as much as they used to. The median household income as of 2015 was $56, 516, still below a peak of $57, 909 reached in 1999 (in 2015 dollars). To take Trump literally, that median is still above where it was exactly 20 years ago, but it's plausible that some Americans are earning less than they did back then. (That said, last year's median income figure was strong reading, considering that it was up by nearly $3, 000 over 2014.) Of course, that's overall household income. As far as hourly wages themselves, it is true that wage growth has been slower than it used to be. Since the recession, wages have struggled to creep much above inflation. But just in the past year, wages have risen 2. 5 percent. ”We are going to reduce taxes . .. for the middle class in particular but for our companies.” In its latest form, Trump's tax plan does reduce taxes for the middle class, but not ”in particular.” In fact, it's much kinder to the   Americans than to anyone else, according to an October analysis from the Tax Policy Center. It found that the middle 20 percent of earners would see their   incomes go up by 1. 8 percent under Trump's plan. The next 20 percent upward would see an increase of 2. 2 percent, and the top 20 percent would see their incomes jump by 6. 6 percent. At the very highest levels, among the top 0. 1 percent,   incomes would rise by 14. 2 percent. Long story short: The higher the income group, the bigger the tax break in general. Trump has proposed a major corporate tax cut, as he indicates here. His plan would bring the top federal corporate income tax rate down to 15 percent from 35 percent. (Many businesses actually pay a much lower effective tax rate than 35 percent, thanks to deductions and other loopholes.) All of that said, his tax plan has already changed once, and it seems that it could again. Trump's nominee for Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, told CNBC this week that there won't be an ”absolute” tax cut for the rich: ”Any reductions we have in   taxes will be offset by less deductions. . .. There will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class. There will be a big tax cut for the middle class, but any tax cuts we have for the upper class will be offset by less deductions that pay for it.” ”The   community was so great to me in this election. They were so great to me. . .. And I got it up to a number that's higher than all of the Republican candidates for years. And the Hispanic community, I did great with the Hispanic community. Great. Higher than people that were supposed to have done well. I felt it. And is this really a big surprise? We did great with women. Can you believe it? Great with women.” Trump got 8 percent of the   vote, according to exit polls. That's better than Mitt Romney's exit poll result in 2012 (6 percent) and John McCain's (4 percent) in 2008 (that said, these are differences of only a few points, so it may not be meaningful). But prior to McCain, 8 percent is no better than any Republican stretching back to 1972, at least, performed among   Republicans, according to exit poll data compiled by the NY Times. The exit polls do show that Trump did far better with Hispanics than many had expected, especially in light of some of his inflammatory statements about immigration.   percent of Latino voters voted for Trump, according to those polls. That's about how Romney performed among that group  —   he got 27 percent. And it's far better than Trump was polling with Latinos before Election Day. Polling firm Latino Decisions had him with 18 percent of Latinos' support in the week ahead of the election. That's one reason why groups like Latino Decisions have called the exit poll results into question, saying that exit polls are poor measures of smaller demographic subgroups, as well as that exit polls don't reach areas where high concentrations of Hispanics live. As far as women are concerned, Trump got 41 percent of their vote. That's not remarkable for a Republican candidate exit polls showed Romney with 44 percent of women's votes in 2012, and 41 percent is also right in the ballpark of how women have voted for Republican presidential candidates since 1992. ”People are pouring in from regions of the Middle East  —   we have no idea who they are, where they come from what they are thinking and we are going to stop that dead cold. . .. These are stupid refugee programs created by stupid politicians.” Much of the criticism surrounding the U. S. refugee program these days surrounds the resettlement of Syrian refugees. As NPR's Brian Naylor reported in November 2015, it takes around 18 to 24 months for a refugee to go through the U. S. screening process. At that time, the U. S. had admitted 1, 800 Syrian refugees over two years, half of whom were children. So ”pouring in” is not correct here, as is the assertion that ”we have no idea who they are.” However, some experts have voiced concerns that the lack of American intelligence resources in Syria means, as Naylor reported, ”there's no way to compile a thorough watch list of possible terrorists from Syria against which refugees can be checked.”"
118639,174613,Trump's Defense Pick Challenges Rules Regarding Civilian Control Of The Military,NPR,Brian Naylor,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/12/02/504165486/trumps-defense-pick-challenges-rules-around-civilian-control-of-the-military,"Retired Gen. James Mattis' nomination to be   Trump's secretary of defense may, well, march through the Senate, but there is one potential obstacle to maneuver around: the retired general part. The National Security Act of 1947, which established the current national defense structure, had a key stipulation, requiring that the secretary of defense be a civilian well removed from military service. In fact, the law is quite clear: ”That a person who has within ten years been on active duty as a commissioned officer in a Regular component of the armed services shall not be eligible for appointment as Secretary of Defense.” The idea was to ensure that the nation's armed forces be controlled by a civilian. Congress almost immediately waived the rule, allowing President Truman to name revered Army Gen. George Marshall to serve as defense secretary in 1950. The law was changed in 2008, reducing from ten to seven the number of years that a nominee must be retired from the military. Still, Mattis does not qualify, because he retired from the Marine Corps in 2013. The question is, how big of a problem is this for Mattis' confirmation chances? A few Democrats have already weighed in. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of NY issued a statement Thursday, saying: ”While I deeply respect General Mattis's service, I will oppose a waiver. Civilian control of our military is a fundamental principle of American democracy, and I will not vote for an exception to this rule.” The top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, Adam Smith of Washington, says hearings will be needed if he is to support a waiver: ”[While] I like and respect General Mattis a great deal, the House of Representatives would have to perform a full review, including hearings by the Armed Services Committee, if it were to consider overriding the statutory prohibition on recent military officers serving as the Secretary of Defense.” Mattis' nomination seems to have strong support from Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain of Arizona says the nation ”will be fortunate to have General Mattis in its service once again” and that he will move forward with the confirmation process as soon as possible. Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, says McCain also committed to writing legislation granting Mattis a waiver. Gillibrand could require the Senate to come up with 60 votes to approve a waiver, meaning at least eight Democrats would have to join presumably unified Senate Republicans to move the nomination to the confirmation process."

Kellogg's announced it is pulling ads from the site Breitbart  —   which publishes   content. Other brands are planning similar moves. But there's one big reason to believe this is just a   reaction in the heat of the moment, not a   trend. A new filter, In general, big brands don't want to place their ads next to a story or picture that could create a problem for them. They've built filters to ID and avoid things like porn,   or even, in some cases, real news. ”If there was an airplane accident in Florida you don't want to be promoting discount airfare or vacation travel in the context of that article,” says Wayne Gattinella, CEO of DoubleVerify. He helps to build these filters. Gattinella says his customers, the brands that advertise, recently requested that he build a new filter to blacklist news that is fake   extremist  —   rightwing or leftwing sites that may include sensational headlines or little original reporting. He says nearly half of the hundreds of sites he's identified in this category did not exist at the beginning of this year. They're newer, and according to his estimates, traffic to these sites has nearly doubled in the last month alone. He pulls up an example of one site he's identified as extremist, called Young Conservatives. In between stories about Clinton's emails and   Trump saving manufacturing jobs, Gattinella and I each see ads from names we know. He gets American Express and Verizon. I get West Elm. ”You might have been looking at furniture last night or something similar and they're targeting you,” he says. That's exactly what happened. Big brands could choose to take away their ad dollars and financially devastate this site, if they decide being there harms their brand. NPR reached out to Young Conservatives for comment, but the founders did not respond. This week Kellogg's pulled ads from Breitbart, and in response Breitbart called for a boycott of Kellogg's products, like Frosted Flakes. But this standoff may just be a blip. Gattinella says it's by no means a given that the entire industry will reject   content. ”If advertisers are comfortable with that type of content, we're not being judgmental per se. We're not making the decision as to whether Disney should advertise on that site. Disney makes that decision.” Fake news versus fake eyeballs, And now here's a fascinating factor that'll drive that decision. While fake news is getting heat right now, the much bigger problem  —   for advertisers  —   is the problem of fake eyeballs. Tolman Geffs,   of investment bank JEGI, which focuses on media, marketing and tech, explains: ”What people do care about in the advertising world to a much, much greater extent is fraudulent ad impressions.” He's referring to bots. Many websites game the advertiser by making it look like they've got way more traffic than they do, by unleashing an army of bots (computer software) to view and reload pages. Every new page view costs advertisers money  —   and they're sick and tired of paying for those fake eyeballs. ”So do I want to be next to fake news? No, not really,” Geffs says. ”What's my worry meter reading on that one versus my worry meter reading on fraudulent ads, where 40 percent of what I'm paying for has not been seen by a human being?” For advertisers, he says, ”fake eyeballs” is like a 9. 5 on the worry meter, fake news just a 3 or 4  —   and, to the extent that fake news draws real eyeballs, it may be even less of a problem."
118641,174615,Americans Don't Trust Scientists' Take On Food Issues ,NPR,Dan Charles,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/12/02/504034298/americans-dont-trust-scientists-take-on-food-politicians-even-less,"If you're curious about what people really think about some of the hottest of   food controversies, the Pew Research Center has just the thing for you: a survey of attitudes toward genetic modification, organic food and the importance of eating healthfully. The survey results are published in a   report that can keep you occupied for days. But if you're pressed for time, here are some of the most interesting highlights that caught our eye. 1. A lot of Americans don't care what scientists think about GMOs, For instance, 39 percent of the survey participants believe that genetically modified foods are worse for your health than   food. However, there's essentially no scientific evidence to support that belief  —   a conclusion confirmed most recently by a National Academy of Sciences report. Among the relatively small group who say they care about the issue of GM foods ”a great deal” (16 percent of the public)   believe that GMOs are bad for your health. At the same time, it's notable that almost half the respondents  —   46 percent to be precise  —   say that they care about the issue of GMOs ”not too much” or ”not at all.” Americans believe that there's no scientific consensus on GMOs. Just over 50 percent of respondents believe that ”about half or fewer” of scientists agree that GM foods are safe to eat. Only 14 percent's beliefs match the reality  —   that ”almost all” scientists agree that GM foods are safe to eat. And finally, there is deep cynicism about the motives of scientists. According to the survey, Americans feel that research findings are influenced in equal measure by the following factors: the best available scientific evidence desire to help their industries and desire to advance their careers. In the view of the public, all of those factors are more important to scientists than concern for the public interest. Scientists can take heart, though, from one other finding of the survey. People still trust them more then politicians. Sixty percent of the public still wants scientists to play a major role in government policies toward GM foods. Remarkably, only 24 percent of Americans want their elected officials to have a major role in such policies. 2. Food sympathies don't follow political sympathies, Roughly equal shares of Republicans and Democrats (39 percent versus 40 percent) feel that GMOs are worse for people's health. More Democrats than Republicans (60 percent versus 50 percent) believe that organic foods are healthier. It's significant, but not a huge difference. This result is quite different from what Pew found in surveys about climate change, says Cary Funk, the Pew Research Center's associate director of research on science and society. When it comes to climate change, she says, liberal Democrats are much more likely to believe that humans are responsible. Food issues, by contrast, are not as politically polarized. The survey also didn't find any major differences between men and women, or between rich and poor, when it came to views about GMOs or about the healthy qualities of organic food. The wealthy, however, were more likely actually to buy organic food regularly. Finally, there's an overwhelming consensus about one point 72 percent of Americans believe that healthy eating habits are very important in improving one's chances of a long and healthy life, and an additional 25 percent say that it's somewhat important. But most (58 percent) also say they fall short of their goals and that ”most days I probably should be eating healthier.” 3. Food issues don't divide people into neat little camps, If you look closely at the results, you find that there aren't clearly defined groups of people who all believe the same things about various food issues. For instance, 18 percent of Americans say that their ”main focus” is eating healthy and nutritious food. And 16 percent says that they care about genetically modified foods ”a great deal.” But these are not the same people. Only a third of the people who care most about eating healthfully also care a lot about GMOs. And whether a person cares about eating healthful food or not is no predictor of whether he or she considers GMOs to be bad for health. There is a much stronger connection, however, between attitudes about healthy eating and consumption of organic food. People who describe healthy eating as their ”main focus” were almost three times as likely to eat organic food regularly, compared with people who say that healthy eating is not at all important to them. Finally, support for local and organic food seems to be much more mainstream than the opposition to GMOs. Almost   of Americans said that they bought local food recently, and just over   said they had purchased organic food.

Police Shooting Trial Says It Is Struggling To Reach Verdict,NPR,Rebecca Hersher,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/02/504160304/jury-in-s-c-police-shooting-trial-says-it-is-struggling-to-reach-verdict,"Updated at 6:40 p. m. ET, The jury in the murder trial of former North Charleston, S. C. police Officer Michael Slager told the judge on Friday afternoon that it's having trouble coming to a unanimous verdict. They will resume deliberating Monday. Slager is accused of murder for shooting Walter Scott multiple times as he ran away from the officer in 2015, after a routine traffic stop. The jury heard nearly a month of testimony in the case, including testimony from Slager. Friday was the third day of deliberations. The jurors had three options if they hoped to avoid a mistrial: a guilty verdict on murder or voluntary manslaughter, or an acquittal. But, as a series of Friday afternoon notes from the jury to the judge made clear, one of the 12 jurors could not agree with the other 11 on a guilty verdict. In a letter read from the bench by Judge Clifton Newman, the dissenting juror wrote, ”I understand the position of the court, but I cannot in good conscience consider a guilty verdict. . .. I expect those who hold opposing views will not change those views.” ”We all struggle with the death of a man and with all that has been put before us,” the letter continued. ”I still cannot convict the defendant. At the same time my heart does not want to tell the Scott family that the man who killed [Walter Scott] . .. is innocent. But with the choices, I cannot and will not change my mind.” Two other notes to the judge were both from the foreperson of the jury, who wrote in the first, ”It's just one juror who has the issues,” and in the second, ”That juror needs to leave, he is having issues. Thank you. Sorry for all the notes.” Around 4 p. m. Judge Newman asked the foreperson to clarify in writing whether the jury was hopelessly deadlocked. At that point, attorneys for the defense requested a mistrial, and the jury sent another note saying it was ”hopelessly deadlocked.” But when the jury reentered the courtroom, the foreperson did not confirm that the jury would be unable to reach a unanimous verdict if they were given more time, saying instead that they felt more information about the law would have been helpful. About half an hour later, the foreperson told the judge the jury wished to keep deliberating. Earlier in the day, the judge refused to answer a question from the jury about the difference between ”fear” and ”passion,” which seemed to relate to the question of whether Slager acted in   when he shot Scott. At one point in the afternoon, Judge Newman called the jury into the courtroom and encouraged members to break the deadlock. ”You should not give up your firmly held opinions just to be in agreement,” Newman said, but ”the majority should consider the minority's position, and the minority should consider the majority's position.” The judge said: ”If you cannot agree on a verdict, I must declare a mistrial. In that case, it doesn't mean anyone wins. It just means at some other time I will try this case with some other jury sitting where you now sit. The same participants will come, and the same lawyers will ask basically the same questions and get basically the same answers.” As The   has reported, cellphone video from a bystander appears to show Slager shooting Scott multiple times in an empty lot at a distance of more than 15 feet. When Slager took the stand earlier this week, he said in his testimony that he had been ”in total fear” during the incident, and contended, as he has previously, that Scott had taken his Taser stun gun. Video of the shooting does not appear to show any Taser in Scott's hand. The City of North Charleston has already approved a $6. 5 million civil settlement with Scott's family in connection with the killing, and Slager is also facing separate federal civil rights charges for shooting Scott. As we've reported, ”in that indictment, federal prosecutors accuse Slager of deliberately misleading investigators by telling them he had fired his weapon 'while Scott was coming forward at him with a Taser. '” The indictment continues, ”In truth and in fact, as defendant MICHAEL SLAGER then well knew, he (SLAGER) repeatedly fired his weapon at Scott as Scott was running away from him.”"
118643,174617,Instagramps: Long-Distance Grandpa's Art Carries His Love Across The World,NPR,Jacklyn Kim,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/12/02/504003640/instagramps-long-distance-grandpas-art-carries-his-love-across-the-world,"This is a story about love and transformation. But first, it starts with resistance. At 75, Chanjae Lee absolutely hated the idea of learning this bizarre thing called Instagram. He had never used the Internet before, never once owned an email account, and never understood the concepts behind Google or Facebook. Why did he have to learn Instagram? It was because he missed his grandchildren, dearly. When they all lived in Brazil, Lee loved seeing his grandchildren every day: driving them to school, then picking them up, eating lunch together. But when they moved away to South Korea, where Lee originally emigrated from, he felt stuck and didn't know how to spend his extra time. He started watching Korean television. A lot of Korean television. That worried his family. Lee's son Ji, a designer who works for Facebook and lives in NY, wanted to steer his father back into something more productive, like drawing again  —   as he used to do a lot when Ji was young. What if his father could draw a picture, and then his mother  —   who's much more curious about the Internet and social media  —   could post it on Instagram? The plan didn't go far, Ji says. ”My father really hated the idea of drawing again. He didn't understand . .. why would anybody be interested in looking at his drawings?” The idea felt forced. They tried it anyway, but the process was painstaking. Chanjae hadn't picked up a paintbrush in 35 years, and Ji struggled to coach his mom over the phone on how to angle shots and use filters. After a few months, they were ready to give up the hassle. That's when Ji's own son, Astro, was born  —   and everything changed. Ji finally convinced his father to give Instagram another chance, so his grandchildren could get to know him  —   even when, one day, he is no longer around  —   through his lasting art. This is the story that Ji shared in a sweet slideshow on Facebook that hit more than a million views in its first 24 hours. The creation of Lee's new account, ”drawings_for_my_grandchildren,” began a new challenge: teaching the    grandpa to use Instagram himself. It took about a week of sitting down for several hours each day until Ji's father grasped what the   app did. They walked through the basic steps  —   opening an app by clicking an icon, taking the pictures, applying filters, adding captions  —   over, and over, and over. Ji says he's learned a lot about empathy and patience: ”I caught myself getting annoyed at him, saying 'Oh my god I told [you] like 20 times, how can you not get this!' And I had to tell myself, 'OK, you have to calm down and slow down, because he just doesn't know. . .. He wants to learn, it's just extremely difficult for him. '” Hashtags presented the most bewildering concept for Chanjae to grasp. It finally clicked, Ji says, when he described it as an ”organizing system” for topics that people on Instagram are interested in: type in some words with this sign in front, and a bunch of related posts pop up. He showed the process by looking up #watercolor, and his father was shocked. ”Oh my god, that's fun!” he said, very impressed. ”There are amazing watercolor drawings!” Since then, Chanjae has not only been posting his drawings on Instagram, but he now also uses Facebook, Google and the iPad that Ji recently bought him as a gift  —   every day. His grandchildren love seeing the pictures on Instagram, along with more than 110, 000 others who follow his account  —   a response that has surprised the Lee family. ”This project really changed the life of my father and my family,” Ji says. ”The most rewarding thing so far has been receiving hundreds and hundreds of messages from people who said, 'Your story's inspired me so much to talk to my parents who are old, who used to paint or used to take photos, and I'm going to now talk to them and teach them how to use Instagram.' ” For melting our hearts . .. thank you, grandpa!"
118644,174618,U.N. Finally Apologizes For Cholera In Haiti ... But Omits One Point,NPR,Jason Beaubien,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/12/02/504173541/u-n-finally-apologizes-for-cholera-in-haiti-but-omits-one-point,"For six years, Haitian activists have demanded that the United Nations accept responsibility for cholera in Haiti. Yet many seemed almost shocked on Thursday by U. N.   Ban  's apology for the U. N.'s role in the outbreak. Shocked  —   and pleased. Activists who have screamed on social media, protested in the streets and filed legal claims against the U. N. over the issue welcomed the  's new plan to address cholera in the deeply impoverished Caribbean nation: a proposal to pour $400 million into Haiti to fight cholera and compensate victims of the attack. Ban  's statement also noted that ”the preponderance of the evidence does lead to the conclusion that personnel associated with the [U. N.'s peacekeeping] facility were the most likely source.” But he stopped short of apologizing for the fact that the bacteria was brought to the island by Nepalese peacekeepers and flowed out of toilets from their base in to a local water supply. For that reason, Philip Alston, the U. N.'s human rights special rapporteur, told The Guardian that Ban   had made a ” .” Others were optimistic. ”The U. N.'s promises are promising,” says Brian Concannon, the head of the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, a harsh critic of the U. N. on this issue and one of the leaders of the legal campaign to try to force the U. N. to pay reparations to victims of the outbreak. U. N. peacekeepers inadvertently brought cholera to Haiti in 2010 just after the crippling earthquake. The outbreak, which is still ongoing, has sickened nearly 800, 000 people and killed nearly 9, 000. Prior to 2010 cholera had not been reported in Haiti in decades. Speaking to the U. N. General Assembly Thursday, Ban   said the U. N. deeply regrets the loss of life the outbreak caused. ”On behalf of the United Nations, I want to say very clearly: We apologize to the Haitian people,” the   said. ”We simply did not do enough with regard to the cholera outbreak and its spread in Haiti. We are profoundly sorry for our role.” Concannon, in a conference call with supporters of what his organization calls the ”cholera justice movement,” welcomed the apology and the proposed new funding. ”But we need to fight even harder to get those promises fulfilled,” he added. Even though the U. N. still has not acknowledged that it was involved in bringing the deadly disease to Haiti, activists were appreciative of Ban  's words. ”We asked for an apology and I really deeply appreciate the words from the ” said Junia Barreau, a Haitian activist based in Montreal. ”Victims need these words. They asked for them and they got it. It's an accomplishment.”"
118645,174619,The Electric Blue Polar Cloud Season Came Early This Year,NPR,Rebecca Hersher,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/02/504153643/the-electric-blue-polar-cloud-season-came-early-this-year,"Each year, a glowing mass of clouds forms over the South Pole, high in the atmosphere, trapped between Earth and space. From the ground they look wispy and shimmery, like a   aurora borealis. From space, they look like an   gossamer haze. Scientists call them noctilucent, or   clouds, and this year the noctilucent cloud season came early to the Southern Hemisphere. In the decade since NASA launched a satellite that can take images of the ice crystals that make up such clouds, the clouds have usually started showing up over the South Pole in late November or early December. Composite satellite images posted on NASA's website today show Antarctica under noctilucent cloud cover beginning Nov. 17 this year, tying it with the earliest start measured. The GIF above shows the clouds forming between Nov. 17 and Nov. 28, as captured by NASA's Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere spacecraft, which studies how ice crystals form in the dry upper reaches of the   divide. ”Noctilucent clouds are a relatively new phenomenon,” Gary Thomas, a professor at the University of Colorado, said in a NASA article about the spacecraft's mission shortly after it launched. ”'They were first seen in 1885,' about two years after the powerful eruption of Krakatoa in Indonesia, which hurled plumes of ash as high as 80 km into Earth's atmosphere,” the article continues. But even after the ash dispersed, the clouds persisted. Today's clouds come from space itself, ”seeded by fine debris from disintegrating meteors,” as NASA spokesperson Lina Tran explained on the agency's website. Each day tiny bits of debris from comets and asteroids are swept into the upper reaches of Earth's atmosphere. Those bits of shooting stars could help ”seed” the noctilucent clouds, by gathering moisture around the dust particle. The clouds form when the upper parts of the atmosphere are coldest and wettest. In both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, the summer is when it's most humid ”with water vapor wafting up from lower altitudes,” and it is also, perhaps counterintuitively, when that part of the atmosphere ”is the coldest place on earth  —   dropping as low as minus 210 Fahrenheit  —   due to seasonal air flow patterns,” Tran writes. For those hoping to see them from the Northern Hemisphere, they'll have to wait until next summer, but those who do not live in the Arctic are in luck. ”In recent years [noctilucent clouds] have intensified and spread,” explained a 2013 NASA post about the science behind the clouds. ”When noctilucent clouds first appeared in the 19th Century, you had to travel to polar regions to see them.” ”Since the turn of the century, however, they have been sighted as close to the equator as Colorado and Utah.”"

118647,174621,"Only 26 Percent Of Americans Support Full Repeal Of Obamacare, Poll Finds",NPR,Richard Gonzales,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/02/504068263/kaiser-poll-only-26-of-americans-support-full-repeal-of-obamacare,"Americans continue to be divided along partisan lines over Obamacare, with an overwhelming percentage of Democrats favoring it and an equal share of Republicans having unfavorable views, according to a newly released Kaiser Family Foundation poll. But when it comes to an actual gutting of Obamacare, there's doesn't appear to be a lot of support.   or 26 percent, of Americans favor a full repeal of the health care law, while 17 percent say scale it back, according to the Kaiser poll. On the other hand, 30 percent favor expanding the law and another 19 percent want lawmakers to move forward with the law as it is. The poll was conducted one week after the 2016 presidential election. In its aftermath,   Trump and Republican lawmakers have signaled their intention to follow through on their campaign promise to repeal Obama's landmark health care legislation. Republican lawmakers have voted to repeal Obamacare dozens of times. But the Kaiser survey indicates that there's been a decline in the percentage of Republicans who want to see the law repealed just since October. In that month, 69 percent of Republicansers said they favored repealing the entire law. A month later, once it was clear that the Republicans would be in control of the health care debate, just 52 percent of Republicans said the law should be repealed. Similarly, in October, just 11 percent of Republicans said they wanted the law scaled back but not eliminated. In November, that percentage increased to 24 percent. The poll also indicates that among those who want to see Obamacare repealed, only a third don't want a replacement.   want to see it replaced by a Republican alternative. There are reports that the Republicans may seek an immediate repeal of the law and wait years before settling on a replacement. Overall, the survey finds that some key provisions of Obamacare are very popular among Democrats and Republicans. For example, 85 percent favor keeping young adults on their parents' insurance plan until age 26.   percent like the prohibitions on insurance companies denying coverage based on   conditions. The most unpopular feature of Obamacare? Only 35 percent favor the individual mandate requiring all people to sign up for health insurance or pay a fine."
118649,174623,Study: Vast Majority Of People Who Are Depressed Do Not Seek Help,NPR,Maanvi Singh,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/12/02/504131307/study-vast-majority-of-people-who-are-depressed-do-not-seek-help,"”I lost more than 80 percent of my university friends,” recalls Jagannath Lamichhane. After silently struggling with depression for two decades, Lamichhane published an essay in Nepal Times about his mental illness. ”I could have hid my problem  —   like millions of people around the world,” he says, but ”if we hide our mental health, it may remain a problem forever.” Many of his friends and family didn't agree with that logic. In Nepal  —   as in most parts of the world  —   there's quite a lot of stigma around mental illness. That was eight years ago. Now    Lamichhane is a mental health advocate, working to challenge the stigma around depression. ”People believe that depression is the result of personal weaknesses and the result of bad karma in a past life,” he says. Even worse, they don't believe they can be helped, he says  —   so they don't seek treatment. The problem isn't unique to Lamichhane's community. An estimated 350 million people are affected by depression, and the vast majority of them don't get treatment for their condition either due to stigma or a lack of knowledge, according to a study of more than 50, 000 people in 21 countries. The study was led by Graham Thornicroft, a professor of psychiatry at King's College London. He and his team of researchers from King's College London, Harvard Medical School and the World Health Organization found that in the poorest countries, one in 27 people with depression received minimally adequate care for their condition. Even in the richest countries, only one in five people with depression sought care. The data was published Thursday in The British Journal of Psychiatry. The study also looks at how many people understand that they have a treatable condition  —   and how many are then actually able to get treatment. In Nigeria, for example, only a third of those with depression knew they had a problem and that something could be done done about it. What's behind the stark numbers? ”There are really two key pieces of the puzzle,” says Brandon Kohrt, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Duke University who wasn't involved in the recent study. The first issue, he says, is the lack of trained counselors, psychologists and psychiatrists all over the world. ”But the second thing is there needs to be increased awareness that depression can be treated,” he says. To tackle both issues, WHO launched its Mental Health Gap Action Programme back in 2008. In 2010, the program developed a basic training guide to help primary care providers recognize and treat common mental ailments. ”Once you manage to change the life of one person in a community, he or she can become an advocate,” Kohrt says  —   and can help educate family, friends and neighbors about depression. That's basically how things played out in Nepal with Jagannath Lamichhane. ”My suffering actually started when I was 10 years old,” he says. But back then, ”I wasn't aware what was happening.” He didn't want to go to school and had trouble sleeping at night. His mental state started affecting his physical health he had constant headaches and often felt weak. But doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong. His father then remembered an old friend who worked as a psychiatrist. ”So with big hesitation and humiliation, we visited my father's friend for an informal consultation.” ”I was lucky  —   my treatment was an exception,” Lamichhane says. His father's friend provided talk therapy and medication. ”For the majority of the public, it's a real battle to get any help.” That's why, he became a mental health advocate. ”My message for young people is, if you feel something is wrong within you  —   seek help.”"
118650,174624,Bitterness Overwhelms As Trump And Clinton Campaign Staffers Face Off At Harvard,NPR,Tamara Keith,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/02/504093288/bitterness-overwhelms-as-trump-and-clinton-campaign-staffers-face-off-at-harvard,"There were moments when watching the Trump and Clinton campaigns discuss the election at the Campaign Managers Conference at the Harvard Institute of Politics was like watching The Jerry Springer Show without the   (or paternity disputes). The 2016 campaign was an ugly,     fight between two different visions of America. So it was fitting that the typically polite and clinical quadrennial gathering of campaign professionals would erupt into shouting matches and accusations raw with emotion. As Harvard's Nicco Mele regularly reminded the political operatives, journalists and students in the audience, the event was intended to take down ”a first draft of history, and we are trying to capture what happened here for generations to come.” For the final panel of the day, senior operatives from the Trump and Clinton campaigns sat across from each other around a big rectangular formation of tables. There were moments when it seemed like a very good thing that 10 feet separated them. Earlier in the day, there was a sense of good humor and mutual respect between the various campaigns (more than a dozen were represented). But with the Trump and Clinton teams face to face, and with the weight of history being written, it turned ugly fast. Here are some key moments: Throughout the conference there was a lot of discussion of Trump's controversies and  . Trump's team said they initially thought it was a problem for the campaign. Corey Lewandowski, who was Trump's first campaign manager, reflected on the weekend in July 2015 when Trump said John McCain wasn't a war hero because he had been captured. Lewandowski said he had counseled Trump to apologize. Instead, Trump embraced his remarks, holding a press conference where he never apologized and further criticized McCain. Lewandowski also said he spoke to Trump before a San Diego event where Trump criticized   U. S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel. Lewandowski said he told Trump not to go there. Trump, of course, did go there, setting off one of the more lengthy and damaging feuds of his campaign. But despite so many such   there was no knockout blow to the Trump campaign. Not the McCain feud, the Megyn Kelly fight, the criticism of Judge Curiel (House Speaker Paul Ryan called Trump's remarks ”the textbook definition of racist comments”) the feud with the Khan family or even the Access Hollywood video where Trump talked about groping and kissing women. Kellyanne Conway, the campaign manager who finished out the election with Trump, had this takeaway: ”There's a difference to voters between what offends you and what affects you. And they were being told constantly, 'Stare at this, care about this, make this the   once and for all.' And they were told that five or six times a week about different things. And yet they went, they voted the way voters have always voted: on things that affect them, not just things that offend them.” It is safe to say there was no agreement why Trump won and Clinton lost. At times both campaigns blamed the media. The Clinton team also blamed FBI Director James Comey's two letters in the final days of the campaign about the investigation into Clinton's email server, as well as   hacking of the Democratic National Committee and campaign chairman John Podesta's personal Gmail account. The Trump team never acknowledged, even when pressed by moderators, that Russia was involved, despite intelligence agencies making it very clear there had been Russian involvement. Trump's team touted its digital efforts and the Republican National Committee's underrated ground game. They also credited Trump's intensive travel schedule, visiting states he was thought to have no chance in but that he ultimately won. But more than anything, they said it was Trump's instincts and ability to talk directly to the American people  —   in a way that was relatable, even while embracing his own wealth  —   that carried him to victory. Even if those instincts sometimes contradicted what their political experience told them should be the right move. Emotions are still quite raw, especially on the Clinton side. And for Trump's team members there was a certain chip on their shoulder that came from a sense of never being taken seriously and yet coming out ahead. That was summed up in a    over whether Americans in fact chose Trump. ”Listen, you guys won,” said Clinton pollster Joel Benenson. ”That's clear. You won the Electoral College. Let's also be honest. Don't act as if you have some popular mandate for your message. . .. The fact of the matter is, is that more Americans voted for Clinton than Trump.” Conway had a simple retort. ”Hey guys, we won,” Conway said. ”I mean, seriously, hold on. Why is there no mandate? You've lost 60 congressional seats since Obama got there.” At one point, discussion turned to the hiring in August of Steve Bannon as CEO of Trump's campaign. Bannon took leave from his job as head of Breitbart, a website Bannon once described as ”the platform of the  .” The term    —   referring to the     movement  —   got a lot of attention in the campaign, especially after Bannon's hiring and after Clinton delivered a speech on the topic in Reno, Nev. ”I am more proud of Clinton's   speech than any other moment on the campaign, because she had the courage to stand up,” said Clinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri. At this point the discussion had grown extremely heated. Then Palmieri delivered the line that stands out the most from the entire 2    discussion. ”I would rather lose than win the way you guys did,” Palmieri said, her voice shaking. ”No, you wouldn't,” interjected Conway. ”That's very clear today. No you wouldn't, respectfully.” ”How exactly did we win, Jen, I'd like to know?” Conway asked, though the question was clearly rhetorical, as she continued. ”We did it by looking at the schedule and looking at, yes, the electoral map of 270, because that's how you win the presidency. And we went places and we were either ignored or mocked roundly by most of the people in this room. But I have a smile on my face at all times.” Palmieri had been talking about the appeals to fear and division, the Muslim ban and  —   as one Clinton campaign operative put it  —   racially tinged ”dog whistles” used by Trump and his campaign. ”As his presidency goes forward, I am going to be very glad to have been part of the campaign that tried to stop it,” said Palmieri. ”Do you think I ran a campaign where white supremacists had a platform? Are you going to look me in the face and tell me that?” Conway asked. ”It did, Kellyanne, it did,” said Palmieri. ”And that's how you lost?” said Conway. At this point an unidentified man's voice is heard saying, ”You guys are pathetic.” Conway continued: ”Do you think you guys could have just had a decent message for the white   voters? Do you think this woman [Clinton] who has nothing in common with anybody . .. ” It devolved into   before Conway regained control of the floor to make her point. She asked, again rhetorically, whether hundreds of counties flipped from supporting Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 because, as the Clinton team asserted, of messaging that appealed to white nationalists, or because ”people aren't ready for a woman president? Really? ”How about it's Clinton  —   she doesn't connect with people?” said Conway. ”How about they have nothing in common with her? How about you had no economic message?” ”You guys are punching down. It's unbelievable,” said another man, though it's not clear who."
118652,174628,Is Being 'Post-Truth' A New Concept?,NPR,Alva Noë,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2016/12/02/502542397/is-being-post-truth-a-new-concept,"The Oxford Dictionary announced a couple weeks ago that ” ” is its 2016 word of the year. According to the dictionary's website, the word is ”an adjective defined as 'relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.' ” The word has been around for a few decades or so, but according to the Oxford Dictionary, there has been a spike in frequency of usage since Brexit and an even bigger jump since the period before the American presidential election. That sounds about right. Feelings, identifications, anxieties and fantasies, that's what actuated the electorate. Not arguments. Not facts. In the case of candidate Trump, what's impressive is not that he openly lied (Obama founded ISIS? The challenge to Obama's status as an American was initiated by Clinton? Climate change is an elaborate Chinese hoax?) What's impressive is that the electorate  —   or rather, a very large minority of the electorate  —   didn't seem to care or at least refused to treat the candidate's dishonesty as in anyway disqualifying. That's the   bit. Is it really so new? Is it really true at all that truth is ”so yesterday” in American  —   and maybe also British  —   political life? I am not so sure. Recall the famous case of Tawana Brawley. As I recall the story, Brawley, who was a teenage girl in NY, came home late one night her clothes had been torn off and racist taunts had been smeared in dog feces on her body. She claimed that a group of white males had assaulted her. This was the 1980s  —   race relations in NY were taut (think: Bernhard Goetz and the Central Park jogger). Her supporters, led by the Rev. Al Sharpton, took to the streets and demanded justice. It was later determined that the events she reported had never occurred. She'd made up the story to provide cover so that her parents wouldn't punish her for staying out late. There is no longer any doubt about this: She had lied. I remember discussing the case at the time with a friend. My friend was livid with tears in her eyes she insisted that what Brawley had said was true even if she had made up the story. For what was true was that black people are vulnerable and experience themselves as victims of white society. Now you might say of my friend back in the '80s that she was ” .” She was letting emotions rather than facts guide her. Alternatively, you could say she viewed the local particular facts at issue as irrelevant to the larger and more important truth of ongoing racial violence and injustice. I don't for a second defend my friend's take on events, but I do think that this sort of case should give us pause before we jump to the conclusion that Brexit voters, or those who supported   Trump, are indifferent to the question of truth. My own view is that Trump's election marks a danger to the survival of democracy in our country. But I am not persuaded that his supporters as a whole are ” .” What's true for these people, as with my friend regarding the case of Tawana Brawley, is a certain story line. This isn't so unusual in political life. An example: It didn't bother me that former President Bill Clinton lied about his sexual relationship with his intern in the White House. But I was not indifferent to truth. I just couldn't get myself to think that anything of importance was at stake. Perhaps this is how Trump supporters feel when   challenge his claim that he's a great businessman or that he's very, very rich. They don't care whether he's right they like the fact that he feels great, that he feels rich. Ditto regarding Obama and ISIS, Clinton and birtherism, the Chinese and ”the hoax” of climate change. It isn't indifference to the truth to be indifferent to some of the outlandish stuff people say. Maybe it's  .

118653,174629,Emergency Evacuation Notice Arrived After The Flames For Some In Tennessee,NPR,Rebecca Hersher,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/02/504126390/emergency-evacuation-notice-arrived-after-the-flames-for-some-in-tennessee,"In eastern Tennessee, officials say a wildfire that tore through resort towns in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains earlier this week killed at least 13 people and destroyed nearly 1, 000 structures, according to local officials and the state emergency management agency. The confirmed death toll in and around the tourist town of Gatlinburg in Sevier County has climbed steadily since the fire raced into town overnight on Monday. On Friday, search and rescue crews from state law enforcement agencies and the national guard were still looking for people who had not made it out of town before they were trapped by flames. The state bureau of investigation has set up a hotline to report missing people. The Knoxville News Sentinel reported that, although the deadly wildfire had been burning in nearby Great Smoky Mountains National Park for days before it moved into town, an emergency evacuation notice did not get to some residents until after the fire was already within city limits. The newspaper added: ”The citywide evacuation order was never relayed directly to area mobile devices due to the constraints of the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System, which limits the text messages to 90 characters, Tennessee Emergency Management Agency spokesman Dean Flener confirmed Thursday. ” 'You cannot just tell them (to evacuate.) You have to tell them what to do,' Flener said. 'People will panic more and you will get people in dangerous situations because you have not told them more.' ”Instead, the evacuation notice was issued to area TV and radio outlets for broadcast  —   several hours after the flames had reached Gatlinburg.” More than 24 hours before the fire entered city limits, the National Weather Service issued a high wind watch for the area, warning of ”winds of 25 to 40 mph with gusts over 60 mph possible across higher terrain.” Gatlinburg Fire Department Chief Greg Miller said at a press conference Thursday the fire had moved very quickly, overwhelming the resources of his department and national park fire authorities, who did not know that winds would gust as violently as they did. Miller told reporters: ”I believe it was around 5 p. m. on Monday I gave a press release that said there are zero fires within the city of Gatlinburg. ”Within that next 50 to 60 minutes, because of the wind pushing the . .. fires closer to the corporate limits [of Gatlinburg] and [because] we had wind speeds started in excess of 87 miles an hour, we had trees going down everywhere. Power lines  —   all those power lines [falling] were just like lighting a match, because of the extreme drought conditions. ”So we went from [no fires in the city] to over 20 plus structure fires in a matter of minutes. And that grew and that grew and that grew.” Despite the rain this week  —   including a destructive band of tornadoes that hit multiple southern states including Tennessee  —   much of the southeastern U. S. including eastern Tennessee, are still suffering from extreme drought conditions, according to the latest report from the U. S. Drought Monitor. So far, the Gatlinburg fire, known as Chimney Tops 2, charred almost 18, 000 acres of public and private land, according to the InciWeb national fire management system. The latest report said more than 450 people were fighting the wildfire, including a fire management team from Colorado. It said the blaze ”was   and is currently under investigation.” An update posted Friday morning eschewed the usually staid language of official updates. ”While many areas within the basic fire perimeter did not burn, the city of Gatlinburg lies literally in the center of the fire perimeter,” the update read. ”This fire hit the communities of Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, and surrounding areas adjacent to Great Smoky Mountains National Park hard as they were preparing for both Christmas and the final few weeks of a bustling tourist season. The feelings of loss are palpable.”"
118654,174630,Time For Homeopathic Remedies To Prove That They Work? ,NPR,Erin Ross,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/12/02/504004506/time-for-homeopathic-remedies-to-prove-that-they-work,"Homeopathy has been around since the 1700s, but despite having devoted followers, there is no scientific evidence that it works. Soon, packages for homeopathic products might say just that. On Nov. 15, the Federal Trade Commission released an enforcement policy statement about labeling for    homeopathic products. Homeopathic treatments have increasingly been marketed in drug store and supermarket aisles, alongside Food and Drug      medications like Tylenol and Mucinex. Some homeopathic remedies have disclaimers that say their products aren't regulated by the FDA. Some don't have any disclaimers at all. One product even claims that homepathic remedies are regulated just like other medicines, which is not true. Homeopathy is based on the notion that ”like cures like.” Remedies include a tiny amount of a substance that might spark similar symptoms, but the amount in most products is so small as to be undetectable. Because they're sold next to medications, the FTC believes that they need to be held to the same labeling standards when it comes to making medical claims on their packaging. And the FTC outlined very specific ways to do so. First of all, the people producing the remedies need to be able to provide evidence that they work. If they can't, they need to add a disclaimer to packaging that says ”there is no scientific evidence that the product works” and ”the product's claims are based only on theories of homeopathy from the 1700s that are not accepted by most modern medical experts.” According to Richard Cleland, assistant director of the division of advertising practices at the FTC, we might not be seeing that exact languages on boxes, but the products need to both say that their claims are not based on scientific evidence, and also say what they are based on. ”And they can't just say that it's based on homeopathic principles. People don't know what those are,” says Cleland. So in some way, companies need to convey that that means      theories. The FTC didn't stop there. On the label, the disclaimer needs to be close to the medical claims the product is making, or even be incorporated into the claims themselves. There will be no hiding this message with a footnote at the bottom of the box or label. It's unclear how long it will take for the FTC to take action against homeopathic products with misleading labels or packaging. In past cases, the FTC has waited several months after issuing an enforcement policy statement to allow companies time to comply or change their practices. Then they send warning letters, and eventually go after the most egregious offenders. Understandably, the homeopathy community isn't happy with these regulations. But Skipp Neville, the president and CEO of Clear Products, a small company based in San Diego that makes homeopathic products, says he'll update the language on his packages  —   if his lawyers agree he should. ”We follow the guidelines for what the FDA requires. The FTC, I can't speak on that  —   obviously there's legal issues.” The legal issue is this: Some people within the natural remedy community don't believe the FTC has jurisdiction to enforce claims on labeling. Daniel Fabricant, the executive president of the Natural Products Association, says that ”this is a clear example of jurisdictional creep.” Labels, he says, are not advertisements. The FTC regulates claims in advertisements. He believes that the labels on homepathic packaging are the FDA's territory. But the FTC disagrees, and so does Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University who teaches courses on labeling. ”The FDA effectively struck a deal with the homeopathic industry that says they won't be regulated as other drugs, as long as they don't say they're FDA approved. Obviously, the FTC sees it differently.” And according to Turley, the FTC does have the ability to require certain label wording. Still, Fabricant believes these new guidelines unfairly target homeopathic remedy manufacturers by requiring them to back up their medical claims with evidence like   trials. ”There's no   trial for plenty of    drugs  —   like aspirin, for example,” says Fabricant. Actually, aspirin might have been the wrong example  —   it's been the subject of tons of   trials. ”Other products need to support their claims, so why shouldn't homeopathic products?” counters the FTC's Cleland. ”They're not different they're going to be held to the same standard.” Cleland doesn't think the labeling will necessarily dissuade people from purchasing homeopathic remedies, and that's not the FTC's goal. ”We believe the consumer should have as much accurate information as they can before making purchasing decisions.” Still, there's always the possibility that these labeling changes might make homeopathy fans like the products even more. Some people who use alternative medicine are distrustful of traditional medicines. Learning that the product isn't supported by modern medicine might be just the endorsement they need."
118655,174631,"Andrew Sachs, Who Played Beloved Waiter Manuel On 'Fawlty Towers,' Dies",NPR,Merrit Kennedy,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/02/504148826/andrew-sachs-who-played-beloved-waiter-manuel-on-fawlty-towers-dies,"Actor Andrew Sachs, best known for his beloved portrayal of a hapless Spanish waiter named Manuel on the British sitcom Fawlty Towers, has died at 86. Sachs had ”suffered from dementia for four years,” according to the BBC. He died on Nov. 23 and was buried Thursday. In the 1970s BBC comedy, Sachs plays a constantly confused waiter who speaks only a little English, working at a small hotel. Manuel provided a vehicle for the show to lampoon the classism of British society. ”¿Qué?” he says over and over again, frequently directed at the hotel's bullying owner Basil Fawlty, played by John Cleese. Most of the gags involving Sachs are centered on Manuel and Basil misunderstanding each other  —   in fact, that was the reason Cleese suggested the character of Manuel in the first place, as he told the BBC: ”The idea that one could constantly have misunderstandings between Basil and Manuel was a terribly simple one, but it worked well and of course it could happen at any point.” Here's a scene that epitomizes that tension and gave Sachs one of his most   lines, ”I know nothing”: Basil rushes in to ask Manuel not to divulge that he has put money on a horse race. As usual, it's a delight to watch the two agonizingly speak past each other. ”I could spend the rest of my life having this conversation,” Basil says, holding his head in his hands. ”Please try to understand before one of us dies.” Despite Manuel's unfailing earnestness and constant   attempts to please, Basil frequently hits the skilled physical comedian, usually with a spoon. ”I never got upset when he hit me,” Sachs said in 2014, according to the BBC. ”He's my friend, I must say yes, yes [it hurt] several times, more than once.” Among Manuel's other counterpoints was the relatively posh, obtuse Major Gowen, with whom he appears in this clip: In addition to his role on Fawlty Towers, the BBC reports that Sachs ”had dozens of other acting roles, both serious and comic  —   including stints in TV's two biggest soaps”  —   Coronation Street and EastEnders. Sachs was ”born in Berlin before his family fled the Nazis to settle in Britain,” according to The Guardian. Cleese spoke about his easy rapport with Sachs, as the Guardian reported: ”It's like playing tennis with someone who is exactly as good as you are. And you play with them every week, sometimes he wins and sometimes you win, but somehow there is a rapport. It comes from the very deepest part of ourselves. We never had to work at it, it all happened so easily.” In a series of tweets after his death, Cleese hailed Sachs as a ”very sweet gentle and kind man and a truly great farceur.” ”I could not have found a better Manuel,” he said. ”Inspired.”"
118656,174632,"Unemployment Rate Drops To 4.6 Percent, Lowest Level Since 2007",NPR,Camila Domonoske,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/02/504115031/unemployment-rate-drops-to-4-6-percent-lowest-level-since-2007,"Unemployment dropped by 0. 3 percentage points, to 4. 6 percent, last month  —   the lowest rate since 2007  —   according to the monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As NPR's Marilyn Geewax notes, 4. 6 percent unemployment is what most economists consider ”full employment,” which she says is ”when the number of people seeking jobs is roughly in balance with the number of openings. It doesn't mean the unemployment rate is zero because that's not realistic.” (It's worth noting that employment varies by region and demographic, so the fruits of full employment aren't shared by all.) The report wasn't all good news: Wages dropped slightly in November, instead of showing a   increase, although they are still 2. 5 percent higher than this time last year. The jobs report says the U. S. added 178, 000 new jobs in November, which is about what economists had expected. But the drop in unemployment was a surprise  —   economists had thought it would hold steady at 4. 9 percent. The BLS notes that the unemployment rate had shown little movement from August 2015 through October 2016. The drop in unemployment was driven by adult men, while the rates for women and teenagers didn't show much or any change. Solid job growth helped push the unemployment rate down to 4. 6 percent. But another proximate cause of the big drop in the rate was a decline in the labor force, NPR's John Ydstie reports, which means fewer people were counted as unemployed. The labor force shrank by 226, 000 workers in November. ”Certainly there were lots of retiring baby boomers among them also, there could be people discouraged because they couldn't find a job, and it could be just be bumpiness in the survey,” John says. He also says the big drop in the unemployment rate could also reflect that it was finally catching up to the solid job creation of the past few months, which until November hadn't produced a corresponding decline in the unemployment rate.   The labor force participation rate, the number of people with   jobs who would prefer   jobs, and the number of discouraged workers all showed little change. Average hourly earnings dropped by three cents, after seeing an   rise in October. Economists had been watching to see if the relatively low unemployment rate would be pushing employers to raise wages, NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. ”In previous years, wage gains have been stagnant,” Yuki told our Newscast unit. ”But in October, wages increased at their fastest pace since the end of the recession  —   2. 8 percent.” That trend did not continue in November. The BLS notes that over the course of the year, counting the small drop in November, wages have increased by 2. 5 percent. Professional and business services, health care and construction all added new jobs, while other major industries neither added nor lost jobs. The report also revised the jobs numbers for the past two months  —   the numbers for September went up to 208, 000, and for October went down to 142, 000. In total the revisions meant there were 2, 000 fewer jobs added this fall than had previously been reported. The November jobs report was being closely watched for anything that might affect future interest rates. One key factor in interest rate decisions is the unemployment rate  —   and how close the country is to ”full employment.” ”More liberal economists say, 'We're not all the way there yet, so let's hold off on interest rate hikes,' ” NPR's Chris Arnold explains. ”More hawkish ones say we need to be raising now to stave off inflation because we're so close to full employment.” Overall, Chris says, this report isn't likely to change the Federal Reserve's planned course. ”The Fed is expected to inch rates higher again as early as its next meeting, later this month,” he reports."
118657,174633,Is Trump's Deal With Carrier A Form Of Crony Capitalism?,NPR,NPR Staff,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/12/02/504042185/is-trumps-deal-with-carrier-a-form-of-crony-capitalism,"On Trump's visit to Carrier in Indiana on Thursday, he mentioned a phone call that he made to the CEO of United Technologies, the air conditioning company's parent. As Trump describes it, that call led to Carrier announcing it will not move as many jobs to Mexico as it had planned. ”We can't allow this to happen anymore with our country. So many jobs are leaving and going to other countries, not just Mexico,” Trump said. Trump made it sound as though the decision to keep 1, 000 Carrier jobs in the U. S. was done over a handshake. The decision appears to have involved a grab bag of concessions from Indiana, including a multiyear, $7 million incentive package. It's not certain, but there may have been some   tactics involved, too. United Technologies is a defense contractor that gets a lot of money from the government. Earlier this week, Sen. Bernie Sanders suggested that Trump should use that as leverage in negotiations to keep Carrier in Indiana. Trump himself implied that such tactics will be part of his strategy to convince U. S. companies to remain in America. ”No. 1, we're going to treat them well, and No. 2, there will be consequences,” he said. Donald Evans, commerce secretary during George W. Bush's first term, says the deal definitely signals a change in approach between the White House and American businesses. But, he warns, dealing directly with each business as Trump did with Carrier is not likely to be a staple. ”You can't get involved in every business all across America. You have to create the environment for those businesses to do so well, and that's exactly what   Trump has in mind,” he tells NPR's Steve Inskeep. But Tyler Cowen, professor of economics at George Mason University who identifies as a libertarian, worries that under a Trump administration, a kind of ”crony capitalism”  —   where companies that are good to a presidency are rewarded  —   will prevail. ”This to me is scary,” Cowen tells Inskeep. ”It indicates an environment where business decisions are now about how much you please the president.” On what kind of message the Carrier deal sends, Evans: You cannot do it all the time. You've got too many things on your plate. There will be isolated situations from time to time. This happens to be one of them that was brought up during the course of the campaign. [Trump] wanted everybody to know that . .. as president, he's going to fight for jobs in America. Now, exactly how this all came down and what added incentives were thrown in there or not thrown in there, I have no idea. But I don't think it's a bad thing for the president to send a strong message to the workers of America that he's going to create the environment for them to do well right here and send that same message to the corporations of America. Cowen: We're supposed to live under a republic of the rule of law, not the rule of men. This deal is completely nontransparent, and the notion that every major American company has to negotiate    with the president over Twitter is going to make all business decisions politicized. We don't know exactly what the company is getting. There's plenty of talk that the reason Carrier went along with the deal was because they were afraid their parent company would lose a lot of defense contracts, so this now creates the specter of a president always being willing to punish or reward companies depending on whether or not they give him a good press release. On whether there's a right or wrong way to interact with American corporations, Evans: Certainly over the long haul you can't get into the mode of picking winners and losers. The great hallmark of this country is we love to compete. And so what I think government's role needs to be, should be, will be under this   I'm confident, is create a playing field for our companies in America to compete not only here at home but around the world and provide that environment so that companies here in America are willing to stay here, employ more people and build their companies here in America instead of some other country in the world. On United Technologies, Carrier's parent company, Cowen: They do a lot of defense contracting it's at least 10 percent of their revenue. Carrier from the state of Indiana was already offered the tax break before the election. They turned it down. Now all of a sudden Trump is president, Bernie Sanders is telling Trump to threaten the defense contracts of the parent company. And now all of a sudden the company takes the deal, and Trump is known for being somewhat vindictive. On crony capitalism, Cowen: Trump and Bernie Sanders, for all of their populist talk, their actual recipes in both case lead to crony capitalism . .. a system where businesses who are in bed with the government and who give the president positive press releases are rewarded and where companies who oppose or speak out against the president are in some way punished."
118658,174637,Full-Size Replica Of The Titanic Is Under Construction In China,NPR,Camila Domonoske,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/02/504111056/full-size-replica-of-the-titanic-is-under-construction-in-china,"A shipbuilder in China has started work on a   replica of the Titanic, the doomed ship that hit an iceberg and sunk on its maiden voyage in 1912. Construction on the project began Wednesday, Reuters reports. When it's finished, the tourist attraction will offer simulations of the infamous disaster, which killed more than 1, 500 people. There's no danger of real icebergs, though. The Titanic replica will be permanently docked at a reservoir in Daying County, in the landlocked Sichuan province. Visitors will be able to eat on the ship and stay overnight, The Associated Press says. The AP notes that the 1997 movie about the disaster  —   James Cameron's Titanic  —   was a massive hit in China. To film that movie, Cameron built and sank a replica of the ship, but it was 90 percent of the size of the original, not full size. Several years ago, Australian billionaire Clive Palmer said he was contracting a Chinese shipbuilder in Jiangsu province to build a   replica of the Titanic. He said his ship would travel the Atlantic route intended for the original Titanic  —   hopefully with more success. But Australian newspapers report that project has been delayed, if not entirely abandoned, giving the ship in Sichuan the chance to be the first   Titanic  . This one won't won't be trying to make an Atlantic crossing. The official newspaper in China, The People's Daily, reports that the replica under construction ”is a fixed tourist attraction as opposed to a moveable ship.” It will be 269 meters (more than 882 feet) by 28 meters (about 92 feet) just like the original. Plans call for replicas of some of the Titanic's interior features, like a ballroom, a theater, a pool and   cabins. Reuters reports the project, part of a planned resort in Daying County, is going to cost more than the original budget of $145 million, and is expected to be finished by the end of next year. Here's more from the wire service: ”Hollywood production designer and producer Curtis Schnell, who is working on the project as its Titanic design expert, said despite criticism online that a tragedy in which some 1, 500 people died was being resurrected for tourism purposes, Seven Star has recognized the venture in a 'very respectful way.' ” 'We're trying to get as close as we can,' he said. 'We are not building every room in the ship, by any means, but the shell of the ship and the exteriors will be quite accurate, there will be interior rooms to be able to tour and see from the standpoint of historical accuracy.' ”"
118659,174638,Hot-Dog Tiaras And Other '70s Dinner Party' Delicacies,NPR,Jessica Leigh Hester,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/12/02/503889034/hot-dog-tiaras-and-other-70s-dinner-party-delicacies,"Last summer, Anna Pallai was leafing through her mom's cookbooks  —     volumes of Robert Carrier recipes, issues of Supercook pinched together in a ringed binder  —   when she realized she'd stumbled across a gold mine. The books were full of meaty aspics and mousses coaxed into elaborate shapes: a crown made of blunted hot dogs, seafood mousse sculpted into the shape of a maniacally grinning fish. Pallai started posting snapshots of the recipes on Facebook, then migrated her impromptu archive to Twitter so she wouldn't clog her friends' news feeds. She found a receptive Twitter audience, accruing more than 35, 000 followers. Now she's spun the project into a book, '70s Dinner Party: The Good, the Bad and the Downright Ugly of Retro Food (Penguin UK). The book borrows the format of Pallai's '70s Dinner Party Tumblr, where she posts questionable '  diet advice and couples photos with dubious captions. One ad extols sugar's potential as a   aid: ”Nibble on a cookie about an hour before lunch,” it prescribes. ”Sugar keeps your energy up  —   and your appetite down.” (Sadly, that's not how it works.) Beneath a pyramid of compacted shredded ham, mayonnaise and almonds, she's swooned: ”Oh, baby, you're the only thing in this whole world that's pure and good and right.” And under a   loaf of bread stuffed with paté, frozen peas, carrots and corn and topped with slices of cucumber that look like toppled dominoes: ”I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.” Pallai, born in London in 1975, says her family's actual eating habits, which skewed toward meatloaf and stuffed peppers and eggs, were heavily influenced by her father's Hungarian heritage. But the recipes in her mom's collection opened up a delicious view onto a food culture that feels starkly different from contemporary tastes. Not all '70s food is outrageous or   Pallai adds. The Baked Alaska, a confection of pillowy meringue and ice cream, is still around, at least on Cutthroat Kitchen. And the   which hit the market in 1971, is enjoying something of a renaissance. (An Amazon search reaps 3, 563 books of   recipes the chef Christina Tosi, of Momofuku Milk Bar fame, promises you can even make cake in the    appliance.) Other retro vestiges  —   bananas cinched with herring and studded with parsley a mold made from tomato soup pureed with cream cheese, mayonnaise and cooked ham  —   are less likely to be enduring  . In Pallai's experience, jiggly, questionably colored food evokes two strong reflexes: repulsion and nostalgia. ”It's either, 'Oh, my god, how could people eat that?' or 'I remember that: My grandma, mom or aunt still makes that now,' ” Pallai says. As much as it's a roundup of some   concoctions, the book is also a kind of love letter to the evolving institution of the dinner party. Pallai describes the '70s ”showboat dinner party” as a tool for social climbing, in which upwardly mobile families bid to impress guests ”via   no holds barred, brightly colored and utterly insane   meals.” Flipping through cookbooks of the era, Pallai noticed how many of them championed an attention to detail. With chapters on everything from invitations to folding napkins and setting the table, these books were about crafting an experience, of which the food was just one component. In the context of a soiree, the dishes ”were meant to be kind of spectacular creations,” Pallai says. ”I think that's something to be treasured.” The author doles out mocking, playful jabs, but her tone never punches down into jeering. She gives due credit to the theater of it all. The '70s weren't subtle, and tomato aspic and fussy coconut cakes are appropriately flamboyant. This is the decade, after all, that kindled the appeal of fiery food. The jiggly foods of '70s Dinner Party, to Pallai, are a kind of answer to the contemporary clean eating trend. Heirloom organic produce is good for you, and beautiful, but it's not as appealingly bizarre as mashed potatoes piped like cake frosting, a wreath of carrot mash flooded with soggy peas, or   sausage suspended in translucent gelatin. ”Nowadays, most people's dinners are far less interesting to look at,” Pallai writes. ”And yet they are far more likely to take photographs of them and force other people to look at them.” Pallai's compendium is a reminder to have a bit of fun with food  —   even if it gets a little weird."
118660,174639,"San Bernardino Shooting's Signs Have Faded, But Memories Remain Piercing",NPR,Nathan Rott,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/12/02/504025469/san-bernardino-shootings-signs-have-faded-but-memories-remain-piercing,"It's been a year since Ray Britain lay on the floor of the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, Calif. feeling the vibrations of the gun shots. He remembers that ”constant tremble,” he says, the ringing in his ears, the shell casings  —   ”a rainbow of shell casings”  —   flying from the gun, and the looks of shock on his coworkers' faces. It's been a year since Britain survived what was then considered the deadliest terrorist attack in the USA since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks: Fourteen people killed and 22 wounded. But he can remember all of it like it was yesterday. ”The dreams keep a lot of it real,” Britain says. ”There're certain things I wish I could just forget, but unfortunately, they just keep popping up.” For some people in San Bernardino and the greater Inland Empire, Dec. 2 will always be the day that established a new normal. For others, the change is less acute. The FBI hasn't released any new information about their investigation into the deceased shooters, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, in months. The trial against Enrique Marquez Jr.  —   a friend of Farook's who is charged with buying some of the weapons that were used in the attack, among other things  —   doesn't start until September. Around town, signs of the shooting have faded too. The police tape is gone outside of the Inland Regional Center, and on workdays the parking lot is full. Commuters drive by a makeshift memorial of fresh flowers and drooping signs, first put up in the hours and days after the shooting when people were still coming to terms with what had happened. In nearby Redlands at the apartment the two shooters left that December morning  —   armed with pipe bombs, handguns, rifles and more than a thousand rounds of ammunition  —   there's a decorative flag by a new front door that reads ”Happy Holidays.” The two neighboring units fly American flags. ”We haven't forgotten it,” says Casey Pace, pushing her kids in a stroller by the house. ”But we have to move on, I guess.” 'I hear his voice all of the time' That has proven difficult for a lot of people more closely connected to the shooting. ”I hear his voice all of the time,” says Mandy Pifer, whose fiancée, Shannon Johnson, was killed while shielding a coworker with his body. ”Most of the time, it's telling me to stop being so ridiculous.” Pifer is a volunteer crisis counselor for the city of Los Angeles and says she's been working more and more since the tragedy. Helping others in their own moments of tragedy, she says, ”is really helping me heal.” For Sally Cardinale, healing has come in fits and spurts. She hid in a bathroom stall with three other women during the attack on the holiday party, and says she still has trouble sleeping. ”Everything I was thinking about when I was in that bathroom was 'I'm going to die and my kids are going to get separated because they have separate fathers,' ” she says. ”I don't know what to do with that.” Some days she feels good other days, she can't get out of bed. ”It's an    all of the time,” she says. Some survivors feel betrayed, abandoned, It's made more difficult by the fact that she feels like it's out of her control. Cardinale is part of a group of survivors accusing San Bernardino County of cutting off   support for the survivors of the attack, including refusing to approve counseling or antidepressant medication. Others, who were physically wounded, Cardinale says, are fighting to get surgeries approved and physical therapy covered. Cardinale says that the fight to get help has felt like a second trauma. At a closed meeting with the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors earlier this week, survivors said they felt betrayed and abandoned, left to deal with California's complicated workers' compensation program without guidance or help. Their health insurers won't cover their injuries because they occurred in a workplace attack. A county spokesman, David Wert, says in an email that workers' comp can be a tedious process, but insists that the county has been as responsive as possible. ”The county is, and always has been, committed to ensuring our employees get all the care they need,” Wert wrote. A city in search of an identity, That's just one aspect of the challenge facing the city of San Bernardino and its leadership. ”I used to tell people that my district was halfway between Los Angeles and Palm Springs,” says Pete Aguilar, the U. S. representative for the district that includes San Bernardino. Now he says, his hometown had been added to a list of cities that people just know for a terrible reason, like Littleton, Colo. or Newtown, Conn. But Aguilar is defiant: ”We will not be defined by this tragedy.” San Bernardino, by Aguilar's admission, is a work in progress. The city of 216, 000 filed for bankruptcy in 2012 and still is facing steep economic problems. Murder and other crimes have spiked in the past year. Down a   street from the Inland Regional Center, resident Akia Ingram says people are leaving the city because there are few good jobs. ”This used to be the place people would move to from L. A. or other places,” she says. ”But now it's just really, really bad.” Ingram watched as the hordes of television crews and police officers came and went last December following the attack, and says she couldn't help but feel angry that few thought to report on or address the city's other problems. ”It don't get no attention,” she says. ”Only thing that get attention is something big like that terrorist attack.” 'We're a better community now' Some have hope, though, that the attack still could help the city find its footing to address those issues. ”We're a better community now, even though we're hurt,” says Brian Levin, a criminal justice professor at California State University, San Bernardino, who studies hate crimes. In the days and weeks that followed the tragedy, Levin met with faith leaders, law enforcement and families of the victims, and he says he noticed a unity of shock and shared pain. While other parts of the country were arguing about gun laws and immigration, and as hate crimes against Muslims rose, San Bernardino ”didn't have the luxury to be divisive,” he says  —   something he still sees today. ”[The attack] will always be a part of our history,” Levin says. ”But here's the thing: so will the heroics of those police officers and first responders and medical staff, and so will the grace of the families. We're writing the rest of the history. The bastards lost.”"
118662,174641,Will Gambia See Its First-Ever Peaceful Transfer Of Power?,NPR,Merrit Kennedy,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/02/504122698/will-gambia-see-its-first-ever-peaceful-transfer-of-power,"In a shocking upset, election officials say an opposition candidate has defeated Gambia's longtime leader in the country's presidential vote. This sets the stage for what could be the small West African country's   peaceful transfer of power since it gained independence from the U. K. in 1965. The head of the electoral commission announced that Adama Barrow defeated Yahya Jammeh, who has led the country since he launched a coup 22 years ago, as NPR's Ofeibea   reports. She adds that election Commissioner Alieu Momarr Njai said in his announcement that Jammeh has accepted defeat, but so far there has been no official word from the president. Barrow, a businessman, was able to energize eight opposition parties that then united behind him, Ofeibea reports. Here's more: ”The electoral chief told journalists it was unique that someone who has ruled a country for so long has accepted defeat and that President Jammeh would announce the official vote count and election winner. This puts tremendous pressure on the president who, before the vote, said only divine intervention would remove him from power and predicted the biggest landslide in Gambia's history.” The Associated Press, citing Njai, reports: ”Adama Barrow won 263, 515 votes, or 45 percent of the total, while Jammeh finished in second with 36 percent. A third candidate, Mama Kandeh, received 17 percent.” The vote took place under an Internet and international phone call blackout, as The   reported. The country's   Daily Observer newspaper has not been updated since the result was announced. It continues to predict an ”inevitable” victory for Jammeh. ”Jammeh came to power in a coup in 1994 and then swept elections in 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2011 after a 2002 constitutional amendment removed presidential term limits,” the AP reports. ”Critics say those earlier elections were not free and fair.” Jammeh has a lamentable human rights record, as we reported, and is seen as a leader who brooks no dissent. Social media users were posting scenes of jubilation, as supporters of the opposition candidate took to the streets to celebrate. Meanwhile, it remains to be seen how Jammeh himself will react to the news. It could have major implications if he steps down peacefully, as the AP reports. ”This is going to have resonance way beyond the tiny borders of Gambia,” human rights activist Jeffrey Smith told the wire service. He called this ”a momentous occasion for the region writ large.”"

118664,174643,Quran Exhibition Shines A Light On The Holy Books' Dedicated Artists,NPR,Steve Inskeep,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/12/02/503640678/quran-exhibition-shines-a-light-on-the-holy-books-dedicated-artists,"When you walk into the Smithsonian's ”Art of the Qur'an” exhibition, you're met with a book that weighs 150 pounds. The tome, which dates back to the   has giant pages that are covered in gold and black Arabic script. ”Somebody spent a lot of time, probably years, to complete this manuscript,” says curator Massumeh Farhad. ”. .. The size tells you a great deal about it. I mean, clearly this was not a manuscript that could have been taken out every day for private reading. This was a manuscript that was intended for public display.” That manuscript is among more than 50   Qurans on display at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington, D. C. The exhibition isn't about the words of the Quran so much as the people who laboriously copied the book, letter by letter. Some of their names are listed (one manuscript was written by a vizier, or prime minister, of the Ottoman Empire) but most of the creators are unknown. Either way, each of the pages is one of a kind, and Farhad has flipped through all of them. She says it was a meditative experience: ”You notice things that, you know, nobody else had noticed. For instance, human fallibility  —   because God is infallible but humans aren't. So there are instances where the calligrapher omitted a verse, but then they always found a way around it. . .. They put a little asterisk where the verse actually fits in.” In one Quran, that asterisk looks like an eyelash it directs the reader to look for the missing verse on the edge of the page. In another, the writer corrected a wrong word by covering it with gold. ”It's the gold white out,” Farhad says. The Quran copies are like little peepholes, allowing us to peer back into the lives of people we never knew. When Farhad flips through the books, she says she's really flipping through the past. ”And every page is absolutely breathtaking.”"
118667,174647,China's Foreign Minister: Trump-Taiwan Call 'A Small Trick',NPR,Brian Naylor,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/12/02/504202547/trump-speaks-to-taiwans-president-in-move-likely-to-anger-beijing,"  Trump has been speaking on the phone with numerous world leaders since his election, but a call Friday has the potential to cause diplomatic waves. The Trump transition office confirms Trump spoke with the president of Taiwan, Tsai  . The call has raised eyebrows because the U. S. broke off diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979, when it recognized mainland China. And it's believed to be the first time a U. S. president or   has spoken with a Taiwanese leader since then. The Beijing government regards Taiwan as a breakaway province, not an independent nation. Chinese reaction so far has come from the foreign minister, who spoke with Hong Kong's Phoenix TV, according to the Associated Press: ”Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the call between Taiwan's president and Trump was 'just a small trick by Taiwan' that he believed would not change U. S. policy toward China, according to Hong Kong's Phoenix TV. ” 'The   policy is the cornerstone of the healthy development of  . S. relations and we hope this political foundation will not be interfered with or damaged,' Wang was quoted as saying.” A statement from the Trump transition office said the   and Taiwan's president noted the ”close economic, political, and security ties” between Taiwan and the U. S. It says the two also congratulated each other on their respective elections. Tsai was elected earlier this year. Trump later tweeted that the Taiwanese president called him, not the other way around. Reuters reports that a spokesman for Taiwan's president, asked about Trump's tweet, said, ”both sides agreed ahead of time before making contact.” National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said the Obama administration ”remains fully committed to the   policy” and that ”our fundamental interest in is peaceful and stable   relations.” The U. S. sold arms to Taiwan as recently as last year. There have been reports in Taiwan that the Trump Organization has expressed interest in building luxury hotels there. The   campaigned on taking a hard line toward China's trade practices, threatening to impose tariffs on Chinese imports. Trump has also spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping since the November election."
118674,174661,Former NPR Foreign Correspondent Alan Tomlinson Dies At 69,NPR,Richard Gonzales,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/02/504183689/former-npr-foreign-correspondent-alan-tomlinson-dies-at-69,"One of NPR's most celebrated and admired foreign correspondents, Alan Tomlinson, died in Miami on Nov. 26 from complications related to surgery for cancer. Tomlinson covered Central America and the Caribbean for the BBC and later NPR during the 1980s and early 1990s, when the region was wracked by civil wars and corrupt dictatorships. He was a daring but not rash reporter, whose remarkable prose placed the listener right next to him as he would describe a riot in Haiti or a   bus ride through the highlands of Nicaragua. ”Alan was a terrific reporter, a fearless journalist and a brilliant storyteller,” said former NPR foreign editor Pat Flynn. ”I remember many times he was out reporting in incredibly dangerous situations in the morning, like a firefight between the army and guerrillas in El Salvador, or street violence in Haiti under Duvalier, and Alan could put together a feature story for All Things Considered that afternoon that was full of sound and voices and raw emotion so vivid that he just brought you there. He never lost his cool and he always delivered,” said Flynn. Tomlinson's death stunned many of his colleagues, past and present, who appreciated the many close calls he had in reporting, like when he was kidnapped twice in Haiti. The first time was by a mob and the second by rural police who were unhappy with his reporting on their atrocities. ”Alan came to NPR straight out of central casting. British, dashing, multilingual, with the ability to write shorthand, he had a wealth of   reporting,” said NPR producer Peter Breslow. ”We were in Somalia together, my first real shooting war, and his advice helped keep me safe.” Tomlinson's coverage of Haiti earned him two separate awards by the Overseas Press Club of America, and he shared a DuPont Award for NPR's coverage of the first Gulf War. ”Alan was one of the finest journalists I've ever known. He understood that radio is a narrative art,” said former foreign desk chief John McChesney. His favorite memory of Tomlinson on NPR was at the fall of ”Baby Doc” Duvalier in Haiti in 1986. ”Alan was on the phone live from his hotel in Haiti when an old friend burst into the room. He had just been released from prison and the entire reunion was broadcast. It was an unforgettable radio moment.” Tomlinson was born into a   family in Newcastle in northeast England in 1947. The journalism bug bit him as a teenager and took him to London, Paris and Spain before he went to Central America for the BBC. He never attended college, yet he was fluent in French and Spanish and is remembered fondly by friends as a lover of books and the opera. And he always knew how to have a good time. The Miami Herald quotes a longtime friend as saying, ”Alan danced salsa better than any Brit I've ever known.” In the   Tomlinson turned his talents to television, working for NY Times Television, the Discovery Network's TLC Channel and the National Geographic Channel. Along the way, he won an Emmy for a documentary on the Ebola outbreak in Zaire. In 2006, he signed on with the South Florida public radio and television station WLRN, where he and his wife, Francesca De Onis, produced documentaries on Muhammad Ali, Richard Nixon and the Holocaust. Tomlinson is survived by his wife, Francesca his six children, Nicholas, Emilio, Matthew, Catherina, Ana and Sam his brother, Michael, and his sister, Sheilagh Hume."
118683,174672,Trump And His Supporters Challenge Recount Efforts In 3 States,NPR,The Associated Press,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/12/02/504183036/trump-and-his-supporters-challenge-recount-efforts-in-3-states,"  Trump and his supporters went to court Friday to prevent or halt election recounts in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, less than two weeks before the states would have to complete the tasks to meet a federal deadline to certify their election results. The legal actions seeking to block or halt the recounts in three states Trump narrowly won could cause delays that would make them extremely difficult or impossible to complete on time. Even if the recounts happen, though, none would be expected to give Democrat Clinton enough votes to emerge as the winner. The recounts were requested by Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who says they're necessary to ensure that voting machines weren't hacked, even though there's no evidence that they were. Critics say Stein is simply trying to raise money and her political profile while building a donor database. ”In an election already tainted by suspicion, previously expressed by Trump himself, verifying the vote is a   procedure that would address concerns around voter disenfranchisement,” Stein said in a statement. ”Trump's desperate attempts to silence voter demands raise a simple question: why is Trump afraid of these recounts?” Wisconsin is the only state where a recount is underway. It began Thursday, and one of the state's 72 counties had already completed its task by Friday, with Clinton gaining a single a vote on Trump. Clinton lost to Trump in Wisconsin by about 22, 000 votes, or less than 1 percentage point. Two   groups, the Great America PAC and the Stop Hillary PAC, along with Wisconsin voter Ronald R. Johnson went to federal court late Thursday to try and stop the recount. U. S. District Judge James Peterson on Friday rejected their request for a temporary restraining order to immediately halt the recount, saying there was no harm in allowing it to continue while the court considers their lawsuit. A hearing on the lawsuit is scheduled for Dec. 9. The lawsuit says Wisconsin is violating the U. S. Supreme Court's 2000 Bush v. Gore ruling because it doesn't have uniform standards to determine which votes should be counted in a recount. They also argue that it threatens due process rights because it may not get done by the federal deadline to certify the vote, putting Wisconsin's electoral votes in jeopardy. If states miss the deadline, Congress would allot their electoral votes. The Wisconsin Department of Justice was reviewing the lawsuit, said Johnny Koremenos, spokesman for Attorney General Brad Schimel. Michigan's elections board deadlocked Friday on a Trump campaign request to deny Stein's recount request and on how a recount would be conducted. Both Republican members voted to prevent the recount while both Democrats voted to allow it, meaning it likely would begin Wednesday unless the courts intervene. It also would be conducted by hand, as Stein requested. In separate lawsuits against the state, Michigan's Republican attorney general and Trump asked state courts to prevent the recount, saying Stein should not be allowed to seek one because she finished so far behind Trump and Clinton that she couldn't have won, even if some votes were miscounted. Stein got about 1 percent of the vote in all three states. The Michigan courts appeared unlikely to rule immediately, with one asking for a response from state elections officials by Tuesday. In Pennsylvania, a hearing is scheduled for Monday on Stein's push to secure a   statewide recount there. Republican lawyers filed a motion that was posted on the court's website Friday accusing Stein of engaging in legal antics and saying her recount request endangers Pennsylvania's ability to certify its electors by the federal deadline. Stein has argued, without evidence, that irregularities in the votes in all three states suggest that there could have been tampering with the vote, perhaps through a   highly complex cyberattack. Elections officials in the three states have expressed confidence in their results. Trump defeated Clinton in Wisconsin by about 22, 000 votes, or less than 1 percentage point. His margin of victory in Michigan was even slimmer, at about 10, 700 votes out of 4. 8 million cast. An updated count Friday by Pennsylvania election officials showed Trump's lead over Clinton in that state had shrunk to 49, 000 from 71, 000, as more counties wrap up final tallies. That put Trump's lead at 0. 8 percent, down from over 1 percent, out of 6 million votes cast. It's still shy of Pennsylvania's 0. 5 percent trigger for an automatic statewide recount."
118754,174756,Winners And Losers With The 21st Century Cures Bill,NPR,Sydney Lupkin,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/12/02/504139105/winners-and-losers-if-21st-century-cures-bill-becomes-law,"Updated   : A sprawling health bill that passed the Senate Thursday by a 94 to 5 vote and is expected to gain Obama's signature is a grab bag for industries, academic institutions and patient groups that spent oodles of time and money lobbying to advance their interests. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell calls it ”the most important legislation that Congress will pass this year.” Who wins and who loses? Here's the rundown of what's at stake in the 21st Century Cures Act:  Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Companies, The law would likely save drug and device companies billions of dollars when it comes to bringing products to market by giving the Food and Drug Administration more discretion in the kinds of studies required to evaluate new devices and medicines for approval. The changes represent a massive lobbying effort by 58 pharmaceutical companies, 24 device companies and 26 biotech companies, according to a Kaiser Health News analysis of lobbying data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. The groups reported more than $192 million in lobbying expenses on the Cures Act and other legislative priorities, the analysis shows. Medical schools, hospitals and doctors, The law would provide $4. 8 billion over 10 years in additional funding to National Institutes of Health, the federal government's main biomedical research organization. (The funds aren't guaranteed, however, and would be subject to annual appropriations.) The money could help researchers at universities and medical centers get hundreds of millions more dollars in research grants, most of it toward research on cancer, neuroscience and genetic medicine. The bill attracted lobbying activity from more than 60 schools, 36 hospitals and several dozen groups representing physician organizations. They reported spending more than $120 million in lobbying disclosures that included the Cures Act. Advocates for mental health and substance abuse treatment, The law would provide $1 billion in state grants over two years to address opioid abuse and addiction. While most of that money would go to treatment facilities, some would fund research. The Cures Act would also boost funding for mental health research and treatment, with hundreds of millions of dollars authorized for dozens of existing and new programs. Mental health, psychology and psychiatry groups spent $1. 8 million on lobbying disclosures that included the Cures Act as an issue. Patient groups  Groups focused on specific diseases and patient advocacy generally supported the legislation and lobbied vigorously for it. Many of these groups get a portion of their funding from drug and device companies. The bill includes more patient input in the drug development and approval process, and if it becomes law would boost the clout of such groups. More than two dozen patient groups reported spending $6. 4 million in disclosures that named the bill as one of their issues.  Health information technology and software companies, The law would push federal agencies and health providers nationwide to use electronic health records systems and to collect data to enhance research and treatment. Although the Cures Act wouldn't specifically fund the effort, IT and data management companies could gain millions of dollars in new business. More than a dozen computer, software and telecom companies reported Cures Act lobbying. The groups' total lobbying spending was $35 million on it and other legislation.  Public health, The Cures Act would cut $3. 5 billion  —   about 30 percent  —   from the Prevention and Public Health Fund established under Obamacare to promote prevention of Alzheimer's disease, hospital acquired infections, chronic illnesses and other ailments.  Consumer and patient safety groups, Groups like Public Citizen and the National Center for Health Research either fought the bill outright or sought substantial changes. Although they won on some points, these groups still say the Cures Act opens the door for unsafe drug and device approvals and doesn't address rising drug costs. Medicaid patients seeking hair growth, The act says Medicaid would no longer help pay for drugs that help patients restore hair. The National Alopecia Areata Foundation spent $40, 000 on lobbying disclosures this cycle that included the Cures Act. Food and Drug Administration, The law would gives FDA an additional $500 million through 2026 and more hiring power, but critics say it isn't enough to cover the additional workload under the bill. The agency also would get something it has opposed: renewal of a controversial voucher program that rewards companies for getting drugs approved to treat rare pediatric diseases.

Strong winds and driving rain pounded both northwest Florida and Big Island as residents braced for even wilder weather.  Hawaii officials opened shelters and closed offices, schools and roads on Wednesday to prepare for Madeline, which is expected to pass just south of the Big Island. ”We should all be hunkering down as the storm passes,” said Hawaii County Civil Defense spokeswoman Kanani Aton. Madeline, as it weakened with sustained winds of about 70 mph (113 kph) on Wednesday afternoon, was about 75 miles (121 km) southeast of the Big Island, said Central Pacific Hurricane Center meteorologist Ray Tanabe. The tropical storm, before it moves westward out of reach of Hawaii, could dump as much as 15 inches (40 cm) of rain on parts of the Big Island, according to the National Weather Service. The storm already was lashing the island with rain and wind, resulting in some road closures, Tanabe said. Hurricane Lester, currently a major Category 4 storm, could affect Hawaii over the weekend.  Hawaii Gov David Ige signed an emergency proclamation that runs through Sept. 9, freeing up state resources. Meantime, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for a portion of northwestern Florida as Tropical Storm Hermine continued to strengthen over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The system was located about 315 miles (510 kilometer)   of Tampa with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95  ) the   weather forecaster said late on Wednesday. The NHC said additional strengthening is forecast during the next 24 to 36 hours, and Hermine is expected to be a hurricane as it reaches the Florida's northern Gulf Coast by Thursday afternoon and then sweep across northern parts of the state with driving rain, then northeast along the Atlantic Coast. Florida's governor declared an emergency on Wednesday ahead of the brewing storm as many school districts along the Gulf Coast canceled   activities and ordered students to stay home on Thursday. Heavy rains were already pounding parts of the state on Wednesday. As much as 20 inches (50 cm) could fall over northwest Florida, the NHC said, warning of storm surges and ”  inundation.”  On its current path, the system would dump as much as 10 inches (25 cm) of rain on coastal areas of Georgia, which was under a tropical storm watch, and the Carolinas. Lori Hebert, 40, woke up on Wednesday to flood waters seeping into her house in the Tampa Bay region. Catfish came onto her driveway as the street flooded in Gulfport, a small waterfront city. ”We haven't gotten the main storm yet,” she said, loading a dozen sandbags into her van.  U. S. oil and gas producers in east of the Gulf of Mexico removed workers from 10 offshore platforms, moved drilling rigs and shut some output because of the storm.

127398,190495,Maine governor says will not resign amid racism flap,Reuters,Scott Malone,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-maine-lepage-idUSKCN1161PT  ,"The famously combative   governor apologized for the second day straight to the people of Maine and to state Representative Drew Gattine after calling the Democrat a ”little     socialist cocksucker” in a voicemail message that has been widely circulated. ”I will not resign,” LePage told reporters in his office in the state capital, Augusta, a day after discussing the possibility in a radio appearance. LePage's angry voicemail followed an exchange with a newspaper reporter who asked about comments the governor had made blaming black and Hispanic people for the heroin trade in the Northeastern state. The reporter named Gattine as someone who had raised concerns about the comments, although both agree the Democrat never called the governor a racist. The voicemail ended with LePage urging Gattine to share it widely ”because I am after you.” After meeting with Gattine on Wednesday, LePage said: ”He never called me racist. He said I made racially comments. Maybe in my mind it is semantics but in his mind after talking to him it was clear that there was a real difference.” LePage, whose term runs through 2018, said he ”will be seeking spiritual guidance with my wife and my children.” 'GASOLINE ON THAT FIRE' The   state Senate is still deliberating whether to call a special session to vote to censure LePage, said Majority Leader Michael Thibodeau. ”We can't continue to have the explosiveness that we've seen and so we're in hopes that he's going to find a way to correct that,” said Thibodeau, who would take over as governor if LePage stepped down. ”We live in a time in America when racial tensions are high and we don't need to be throwing gasoline on that fire.” Republicans in the state's   House of Representatives said they accepted LePage's apology and were ready to move on. But House Speaker Mark Eves, a Democrat, called for a meeting of lawmakers to discuss LePage's resignation or removal from office. ”The governor's comments today do nothing to address his increasingly erratic behavior that demonstrates he is unfit to lead,” Eves said in a statement. LePage on Tuesday morning mused on stepping down, saying he was not necessarily committed to finishing his term and adding: ”It's one thing not to have one party behind you, it's another thing not to have any party behind you.” Hours later, he changed his tune, paraphrasing Mark Twain as he tweeted: ”The reports of my political demise are greatly exaggerated,” before trying to change the subject with messages on a visit to a tissue factory. ”Maybe my temperament for the poor and the underdog is over the top but I'll live my life that way. I'm comfortable fighting for the underdog,” LePage said. ”I'm just not a very good politician.”  (Reporting by Scott Malone in Boston; Editing by James Dalgleish and Peter Cooney) NEW YORK Six in 10 American voters support the new ban on people from six predominantly Muslim countries from entering the USA unless they can show they have a close relative here, according to opinion poll results released on Wednesday.

127399,190496,Turkey wants to 'cleanse' strip of territory on Syrian border,Reuters,David Dolan,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey-idUSKCN1160Z1  ," Turkey wants to clear ISIS from a   ( ) stretch of territory on the Syrian side of its border, an official said on Wednesday, a week after it launched an incursion that has strained ties with the USA. Operation ”Euphrates Shield” in which Turkish troops and tanks entered Syria in support of rebels for the first time, began on Aug. 24 with the swift capture of Jarablus, a town a few km (miles) inside Syria that was held by the militant group.   rebels patrolled the town on motorbikes on Wednesday as children played in dusty alleys. The bulk of   forces have since moved further south into territory held by militias loyal to the   Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a coalition supported by Washington in its bid to defeat the jihadists. Turkish clashes with SDF loyalists have alarmed the USA, which has described the Turkish action as ”unacceptable” because it hindered the battle against ISIS. But Turkey, which is fighting a Kurdish insurgency at home, says that, while it remains intent on clearing Islamist militants from its border region, it also wants to prevent Kurdish militias from seizing territory in their wake. Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said the goal was to drive ISIS from a   strip of land along the border with Turkey, which has been buffeted by a spate of bombings, blamed on the group, that have killed scores. ”Starting from Jarablus, the cleansing of this region is our priority,” Kalin told a news briefing. ”We have already cleansed 400 square km successfully.” Turkey has long said it wants a ”buffer zone” in the area, although it has not used the term during this incursion. As well as driving out the   Islamists, it also wants to prevent Kurdish forces taking territory that will let them join up cantons they control in northeast and northwest Syria. Turkey frets that seizing such a broad swathe of territory could embolden Kurdish PKK insurgents on Turkish soil. THUD OF EXPLOSIONS U. S. officials on Tuesday welcomed what appeared to be a pause in fighting between Turkish forces and rival militias, after days when the border area reverberated with Turkish warplanes roaring into Syria and artillery pounded Syrian sites, saying it was hitting Kurdish fighters. In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman told reporters on Wednesday there had been calm in northern Syria in the past 24 hours. ”We continue to work very closely with our coalition partner and ally Turkey in trying to address their concerns about this situation,” spokesman Peter Cook said. ”Likewise we continue to work with our partners in Syria to try and keep the focus where it should be,” he added. On Wednesday only the occasional thud of explosions in the distance was audible along the Turkish frontier. Ankara has denied statements from Kurdish fighters in Syria that a temporary truce had been agreed, saying it would not make any pact with the Kurdish YPG militia, a powerful force in the SDF coalition, as it considers it a terrorist body. ”The Turkish Republic is a sovereign state, a legitimate state. It cannot be equated with a terrorist organization,” EU Affairs Minister Omer Celik told   Anadolu news agency, adding this meant there could be no ”agreement between the two.” Turkey has demanded that the YPG cross the Euphrates river into a   canton in Syria's northeast. U. S. officials have threatened to withdraw backing for the YPG if it did not meet that demand, but have said that the Kurdish group has mostly done so. Turkey's EU affairs minister said some Kurdish fighters were still on the western side and called that ”unacceptable.” Eager to avoid more clashes between Turkey and U. S.  Syrian fighters, the Pentagon said the U. S.  coalition against ISIS was establishing communications channels to better coordinate in a ”crowded battlespace” in Syria. As well as battling ISIS in Syria, Turkey has been rounding up suspected militants at home. Interior Minister Efkan Ala said the authorities had arrested 865 people since the start of 2016, more than half of them foreigners, preventing them crossing through Turkey's long border with Syria and Iraq.

127402,190500,SolarCity adviser Lazard made mistake in Tesla deal analysis,Reuters,Liana B. Baker,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-solarcity-lazard-idUSKCN11635K  ,"While the purchase price was within the valuation range that Lazard came up with for SolarCity even after accounting for the miscalculation, the error illustrates how even leading investment banks can make mistakes on some of the   deals. The mistake came after Tesla and SolarCity   Elon Musk, who is the largest shareholder in both companies, went out of his way to create processes and structures, including a special board committee at SolarCity, aimed at alleviating concerns that he used his influence to force the two companies into a deal.  An analysis by Lazard for SolarCity that indicated an equity value of between $14. 75 and $34. 00 per share was wrong because it   some of the company's projected indebtedness, according to Tesla's filing with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This was the result of a computational error ”in certain SolarCity spreadsheets setting forth SolarCity's financial information that Lazard used in its discounted cash flow valuation analyses,” according to the filing. The error was not included in the valuation analysis performed by Tesla and its financial adviser, Evercore Partners Inc ( ) the filing said. After becoming aware of the mistake on Aug. 18, more than two weeks after the signing of the deal, Lazard realized the accurate valuation range was $18. 75 to $37. 75 per share. SolarCity and Tesla agreed however that the error would not change their view of the deal, according to the filing. The purchase price, to be paid with Tesla stock, equated to $25. 37 per share. Lazard, SolarCity and Tesla declined to comment. Lazard ranks No. 10 in the Thomson Reuters Americas M&A league table so far this year, down two spots on where it was last year. This is not the first time a major investment bank has made a miscalculation on a big deal. An erroneous share count in the leveraged buyout of Tibco Software in 2014 by its financial adviser, Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( ) led to a Tibco shareholder lawsuit that was settled earlier this year. Goldman discovered it had overstated the number of Tibco's fully diluted shares only after the company agreed to sell itself to private equity firm Vista Equity.  This had the effect of lowering the sale price to $4. 14 billion from the $4. 24 billion used in Goldman's fairness opinion. Nevertheless, Tibco decided not to ask Vista to pay the additional $100 million.

127403,190501,Samsung mobile recovery suffers blow as Galaxy Notes 'catch fire',Reuters,Se Young Lee,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-smartphones-idUSKCN1161BL  ," The recovery in Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's ( ) mobile business suffered a blow on Thursday as reports of exploding batteries forced the firm to delay shipments of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, and knocked $7 billion off its market value. Investors drove the stock to   lows after the global smartphone leader told Reuters late on Wednesday the shipments had been delayed for quality control testing, and that shipments to South Korea's top three mobile carriers had been halted. Faults with the new premium flagship device could deal a major blow to the South Korean giant, which was counting on the Galaxy Note 7 to maintain its strong mobile earnings momentum against Apple Inc's ( ) new iPhones expected to be unveiled next week. ”This is some major   for Samsung, especially given all of the   excitement that products like the Note 7 have been garnering lately,” IDC analyst Bryan Ma said.  ”The pending Apple launch puts all the more pressure for them to contain this quickly. The timing of this couldn't have been worse.”     Samsung did not comment on what problem it was trying to address or whether other markets were affected besides South Korea.  Sister company Samsung SDI Co Ltd ( ) said that while it was a supplier of Galaxy Note 7 batteries, it had received no information to suggest the batteries were faulty.         Several people posted images and videos of charred Galaxy Note 7s online and said their phones had caught on fire.  ”Be careful out there, everyone rocking the new Note 7, might catch fire y'all,” one user said in a YouTube clip showing a burnt Note phone. It was not immediately possible to confirm the veracity of the clip. Samsung's shares, which hit a record high of 1. 694 million won last week, fell 2 percent, and Samsung SDI tumbled 6. 1 percent, versus a 0. 1 percent fall for the broader market  . Several South Korean media reports, without citing direct sources, said Samsung will soon announce a plan to recall affected Note 7 phones and replace their batteries as opposed to giving the users a new device. A Samsung spokesman declined to comment on the reports.    DAMAGE CONTROL  Last year, production problems for the curved displays for the Galaxy S6 edge model resulted in disappointing sales, and Samsung risks a repeat this year if it cannot address the Galaxy Note 7 problems quickly.           Its mobile profit is on track to post annual growth for the first time in three years, thanks to robust sales of the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge devices that it launched in March to critical acclaim. The Galaxy Note 7 received similar praise, raising expectations for strong sales in the second half. Samsung said in August demand for the new handset, priced at 988, 900 won ($882) in South Korea, was far exceeding supply, pushing the firm to delay the launch in some markets.  HDC Asset Management fund manager Park   said it now appeared inevitable that Samsung's smartphone average selling price and profits would miss lofty   expectations. ”Apple is supposed to show off the iPhone 7 next week and this issue has emerged, so the current state of things do not look good,” he said. Though a components   will buttress overall profits, Park said mobile operating profit might decline by up to 200 billion won for  .       The mobile division accounted for about 54 percent of Samsung Electronics'   operating profit of 14. 8 trillion won.

127410,190512,Trump's immigration pitch falls flat with Republicans near the border,Reuters,Ginger Gibson and Michelle Conlin,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-republicans-idUSKCN1175Z3  ,"They were either unaware of his whirlwind tour or found that his uncharacteristically diplomatic demeanor during a visit with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico City was overshadowed by his return to his usual fiery rhetoric when back on U. S. soil a few hours later. ”I hope that he does really, in his heart, have a little more compassion than what he spouts out,” said Dave Mitchell, 58, of Surprise, Arizona, a   moderate who says he is begrudgingly planning to vote for Trump. Arizona, a reliably Republican state in past elections, could prove to be a close race in the battle between Trump and Democratic rival Clinton. The   States of the Nation project, which is based on a national online opinion poll, found Trump leading Clinton by only 3 percentage points in the state as of Aug. 26.  Trump's   visit on Wednesday to Mexico was designed to appeal to moderate voters, including those most affected by illegal immigration, who are worried that the real estate mogul and former reality TV star lacks the temperament to engage in international diplomacy.  Pena Nieto had on Wednesday afternoon hailed the impromptu meeting with Trump as ”open and constructive.” Trump later referred to the Mexican leader as his friend and a ”wonderful” president. But only hours after leaving Mexico, Trump delivered a speech in Phoenix, Arizona, in which he again emphasized his desire to build a wall along the southern border and deport millions of people who had entered the USA illegally.  Pena Nieto later rebuked Trump as a threat to his country. Trump launched his campaign last year on a promise to build a wall along the Mexican border to stop illegal immigration, and accused Mexico of sending rapists and drug dealers into the USA. Clinton's campaign announced on Wednesday night it would begin running TV commercials in Arizona, a sign it sees a chance of winning there on Nov. 8. TONE PROBLEM For many moderate Republicans in Arizona, Trump's efforts on Wednesday fell flat. Linda Yaeger, a    retired Air Force officer who teaches at a community college in Glendale, said she watched Trump's appearance in Mexico on her tablet between classes. She said she had hoped Trump would take a more moderate tone after the meeting with the Mexican president, but was disappointed by his speech later that day in her home state. ”Being a moderate Republican means (being) an endangered species right now,” Yaeger said, explaining that she felt the party had moved too far to the right.   Lois Pidde, 70, an office manager in Casa Grande, said she agreed with Trump that immigration is a problem, but opposed his proposed solutions, such as the need for a border wall or a suspension of Muslim immigration to shore up national security.  ”I used to be able to turn him off when he was on 'The Apprentice' and I'd like to keep it that way,” she said, referring to Trump's reality TV show. She said she was likely to vote for New Mexico Gov Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate. Josh Jensen, 35, a Border Patrol agent from southeastern Arizona, said he thinks Trump's plan to build a wall is   and is voting for Johnson too. ”I was thinking maybe Hillary over Trump,” Jensen said. “But I can't vote for either one of the two candidates.” April Chase, 58, of Arizona, was aware of Trump's trip to Mexico but did not watch it. A moderate Republican, she plans to write in U. S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont   who lost the Democratic primary campaign to Clinton. She said she felt Trump was dishonest, ”so I kind of steered away from that.”  (Reporting by Ginger Gibson and Alana Wise in Washington, and Michelle Conlin, Chris Kahn and Grant Smith in NY; Editing by Jonathan Oatis) NEW YORK Six in 10 American voters support the new ban on people from six predominantly Muslim countries from entering the USA unless they can show they have a close relative here, according to opinion poll results released on Wednesday.

127414,190517,Weak Mylan board fosters EpiPen 'debacle': NY comptroller,Reuters,Ransdell Pierson,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-nyc-comptroller-idUSKCN11760A  ,"Scott Stringer said the price hikes, six times what the device cost when Mylan took it over in 2007, have prompted a public backlash and are partly responsible for a nearly 10 percent decline in Mylan's share price in the past month alone. Stringer manages about $163 billion in pension funds for the city, including 1, 059, 357 shares of Mylan common stock worth about $45 million, he said.  ”Mylan's gross mismanagement of its EpiPen pricing strategy exacerbates the company's protracted history of weak board oversight,” Stringer said in a letter to Douglas Leech, a Mylan board member who is chairman of its nominating and governance committee. Mylan, whose tax address is in the Netherlands but with corporate headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, has raised the U. S. price of EpiPen from less than $100 when it acquired the product to more than $600. Amid an outcry by parents, consumer groups and U. S. politicians, the company on Monday said it will soon launch the first generic version of the device for $300, half the list price of its branded product. The EpiPen jabs a dose of the drug epinephrine into the thigh to counter dangerous allergic reactions such as to peanuts, food allergies and bee stings.  Stringer said Mylan has failed to establish independent board leadership and noted the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating alleged land dealings between the company and its lead independent director, Rodney Piatt.  Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin, responding to Stringer's criticisms, said board members, including 10 independent directors, are highly qualified and vigilant. ”The board has been actively engaged in overseeing the execution of Mylan's growth strategy over the past decade   a strategy which has brought hundreds of products to the market,” Devlin said.   Leech and Piatt were not immediately available to comment. Although Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch called the  cheaper generic EpiPen an ”extraordinary” commercial response, criticism has continued to rain down on the drugmaker. The U. S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is investigating the company's EpiPen pricing strategy.

( ) ”This unanimous decision makes it clear that the company has been operating in violation of federal law by refusing to come to the bargaining table,” said Gary Casteel, UAW   in a statement. ”We urge Volkswagen to accept the NLRB order and bargain with the local union at the earliest possible date.” Volkswagen has filed an appeal against the National Labor Relations Board's order in the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the company said in an email to Reuters.  Volkswagen has said earlier that it will go to a U. S. federal appeals court in an effort to keep the UAW union from representing a portion of the company's plant workers in Chattanooga. Late last year, a majority of the maintenance, or skilled trades, workers at VW's plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, voted to be represented by the UAW.  The vote marked a rare victory for the union in the U. S. South, where it has fought many unsuccessful battles to organize   auto plants. Volkswagen was at one time welcoming to the UAW at Chattanooga. But that was before the union lost a closely contested election open to all of the plant's 1, 500 workers in February 2014.

S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The National Labor Relations board on Aug. 26 sided with the UAW in the union's effort to get VW to negotiate wages and benefits for about 160 of the 1, 500 hourly workers at a VW plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Thursday's filing was expected. The NLRB decision for the UAW in the dispute was highly anticipated, and VW had previously said it would appeal if the ruling went against the   company. The union sought to represent only a portion of the plant's workers after it in February 2014 narrowly lost an election to represent all 1, 500 hourly workers at the Chattanooga plant. In December 2015, the union handily won the right to represent about 160 skilled trades workers who maintain machinery at the plant. The UAW has never been able to win an organizing vote at a   auto assembly plant in the U. S. south. A victory, even for only a portion of workers at the VW plant, would give the union a stronger foothold in the south, where most   auto plants are located. On Thursday, VW said in a statement that it ”respects the right of all of our employees to decide the question of union representation. This is why we disagree with the decision to separate Volkswagen maintenance and production workers and will continue our effort to allow everyone to vote as one group on the matter of union representation.”   UAW   Gary Casteel said in a statement on Thursday evening that the union is ”disappointed that Volkswagen is continuing to thumb its nose at the federal government. The federal courts have consistently upheld the NLRB labor standard that enabled the   vote in Chattanooga.” The UAW has for several years been assisted in its effort to organize workers in Tennessee by the powerful German union IG Metall, which has members on the VW Supervisory Board. Earlier on Thursday, the head of IG Metall, Joerg Hofman,  demanded that VW enter talks with the   workers. IG Metall in a statement said that Hofman ”is calling for VW to no longer act contrary to American labor law, and to seek talks with UAW without delay.”  (Reporting by Bernie Woodall; Editing by Bernard Orr) BRUSSELS French carmaker PSA Group  secured unconditional EU antitrust approval on Wednesday to acquire General Motors'  German unit Opel, a move which will help it better compete with market leader Volkswagen .

127418,190522,Venezuelan opposition floods Caracas in vast anti-Maduro protest,Reuters,Diego Oré and Brian Ellsworth,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKCN1173LS  ," Opponents of President Nicolas Maduro flooded Venezuela's capital on Thursday in one of the biggest mass protests against socialist rule for more than a decade. Dressed in white and chanting ”this government will fall,” hundreds of thousands rallied across Caracas to demand a recall referendum against Maduro and decry a deep economic crisis in the South American OPEC nation. The opposition Democratic Unity coalition estimated at least 1 million people took part after protesters streamed into Caracas from the Amazon jungle to the western Andes.   ”We are going to bring down Maduro!” said Naty Gutierrez, 53, whose   (120 km) drive from Maracay into Caracas took three times longer than usual due to soldiers' roadblocks.  ”We are going to defeat hunger, crime, inflation and corruption. They've done nothing in 17 years. Their time is finished,” she said, surrounded by thousands of people waving banners and national flags at one gathering point. The government, which mounted its own, smaller   did not give numbers for the turnout. The opposition hoped its protests would prove they are the majority and heap pressure on Maduro and the national election board to allow a plebiscite on his rule, as allowed by the constitution   through a presidential term. But with the election board dragging its feet over the process and the government swearing the referendum will not happen this year, the opposition has no way to force it no matter how many people it brings onto the streets.  The timing is   because if a plebiscite were held in 2017 and Maduro lost, his handpicked vice president would take over for the ruling Socialist Party, rather than triggering a new presidential election. In power since Hugo Chavez's presidency from 1999, the socialists have hit a low ebb as falling oil prices and a failing   economy have left the country in turmoil.   inflation, a third year of recession, shortages of basics, and long lines at shops have exasperated many of Venezuela's 30 million people. The frustration led to a resounding opposition win in a December legislative vote. ”READY FOR EVERYTHING” Maduro, 53, denounced what the opposition had billed as the ”Takeover of Caracas” as a front for coup plans, akin to a   2002 putsch against his mentor Chavez, who died of cancer three years ago. Maduro has failed to replicate his charismatic predecessor's popular appeal, and his ratings in opinion polls have halved to just over 20 percent. ”We have stopped the coup today, the violent, fascist ambush,” Maduro told supporters, saying detentions of activists in recent days had prevented violence. At least a dozen opposition campaigners were still in custody on Thursday, according to rights groups and the opposition. Extra police and troops were positioned around Caracas, and there were roadblocks on most major routes into the capital from the provinces, with buses being blocked and traffic crawling. ”All they are interested in is staying in power,” said construction worker Luis Palacios, 59, from the poor Caracas neighborhood of Petare. ”We want change, we are hungry.” After the main events had finished peacefully, a small group of youths, many covering their faces, hurled stones and petrol bombs at security forces who fired back teargas during a standoff on a highway in Caracas.  The opposition Democratic Unity coalition said the youths  were infiltrators trying to sow trouble. Fearing violence, especially given 43 deaths around   protests in 2014, many businesses in the capital had stayed closed. Dozens of indigenous people marched hundreds of miles from their home state of Amazonas. Swearing loyalty to Chavez's legacy and calling opposition leaders a wealthy elite intent on controlling Venezuela's oil, thousands of   government supporters also gathered for  . ”The opposition want to topple the president, but they won't be able to,” said lawyer and civil servant Adriana Jimenez, 44, at one such rally close to a huge inflatable puppet of Chavez in downtown Caracas. Like other ”Chavista” loyalists, she blamed Venezuela's ailing economy on an ”economic war” by businessmen hiking prices and hoarding goods.

127419,190524,Exclusive: HP Enterprise in talks to sell software unit to Thoma Bravo - sources,Reuters,Greg Roumeliotis and Liana B. Baker,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-hpe-software-thomabravo-idUSKCN1175RV  ,"The negotiations come as HPE Chief Executive Meg Whitman seeks to focus the U. S. company's strategy on networking, storage, data centers and related technology services, after its separation last year from computer and printer maker HP Inc ( ). MORE FROM REUTERS: HPE has received offers for the software unit of as much as $7. 5 billion in a sale process managed by investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( ) the sources said this week. Thoma Bravo has made the highest offer for the assets among the private equity firms that held discussions with HPE, though significant discrepancies in valuation expectations persist and no deal is certain, the people said. Other private equity firms that made offers for the software assets include Vista Equity Partners Management LLC, Carlyle Group LP ( ) and TPG Capital LP, the people said. It was still possible that HPE would turn to a buyout firm other than Thoma Bravo to pursue a deal, or that Thoma Bravo would buy only some of the assets, the people said. A sale of HPE's entire software division to a single private equity firm would be easier if the latter already owns some related companies, the people said. Thoma Bravo owns several software companies, including Dynatrace LLC and Compuware Corp, which could produce cost savings and efficiencies if combined with some of HPE's software assets, the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. HPE, Goldman Sachs, Thoma Bravo, Vista Equity, Carlyle and TPG declined to comment. HPE shares rose as much as 4 percent on the news and ended Thursday's NY trading up 3. 2 percent at $22. 16, giving the company a market capitalization of $36. 8 billion. HPE's software unit generated $3. 6 billion in net revenue in 2015, down from $3. 9 billion in 2014. The company has said revenue growth in its software unit has been challenged by a market shift toward cloud subscription offerings. HPE acquired part of its software portfolio as a result of its   $10. 3 billion acquisition of Autonomy Corp in 2011 and the $4. 5 billion acquisition of Mercury Interactive in 2006. The software assets also include Vertica, a big data analytics platform, ArcSight, a cyber security firm as well as products for IT operations management. HPE is the latest technology company looking to slim down a large portfolio of noncore software assets that are struggling to generate growth. In June, Dell Inc [DI. UL] agreed to sell its software division to buyout firm Francisco Partners and the private equity arm of activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp for more than $2 billion. In May, HPE agreed to merge its IT services and outsourcing unit with Computer Sciences Corp CSC. N to create a $9 billion company in a     transaction known as a Reverse Morris Trust.

127420,190525,Pennsylvania reinstates Uber's record $11.4 million fine,Reuters,Jonathan Stempel,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-tech-pennsylvania-idUSKCN1175ZQ  ,"By a   vote, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission rejected Uber's arguments that the penalty, six times larger than any it had imposed, was unnecessary and excessive. Uber, in a statement, said it intends to appeal to a Pennsylvania state court, and overturn what it called an ”absurd” fine imposed for ”technical violations.” The PUC, which regulates taxi services and Uber rivals such as Lyft, had sanctioned Uber for having from February to August 2014 provided 122, 998 rides in Pennsylvania without prior approval, and obstructing a state probe into its operations. It imposed the fine on April 21, reducing it from the $49. 9 million ordered by two administrative law judges. The PUC agreed in June to reconsider the payout at Uber's request, over the objection of state officials who called the fine an ”appropriate response” to Uber's ”lawless conduct.” Uber offered new evidence that its service benefited Pennsylvanians, and that any fine should be capped at $1, 000 per day, or roughly $200, 000, and not based on the number of trips. But the PUC said in its   decision that Uber ”failed to set forth any new and novel arguments that appear to have been overlooked or not addressed in our prior determination.” In its statement, Uber said the decision sends a ”troubling message that Pennsylvania is unwelcoming to technology and innovation,” and shows why the state needs ”permanent, statewide   legislation as soon as possible.” Based in San Francisco, Uber has drawn criticism from taxi companies losing market share, regulators concerned about driver and passenger safety, and riders upset over high prices. The PUC previously found that Uber had in 2014 posed a risk to public safety by offering rides without proof its drivers, vehicles and insurance provisions met state standards. It also said Uber's contention that it served only a limited customer base at the time ”rang hollow,” given its ”persistent claim” that it provide its service to meet overwhelming demand, despite two    orders.

127422,190528,U.S. Senate's Reid warns against postponing spending decisions,Reuters,Susan Cornwell,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-spending-idUSKCN1175UR  ," U. S. Senate Democrats would not agree to postponing completion of this year's spending legislation until 2017, the chamber's top Democrat said on Thursday, warning the majority Republicans against considering such an approach when Congress returns next week. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid spoke after some conservative groups outside Congress earlier this week said it would be better for lawmakers not to finish a government appropriations bills until early 2017, when there will be a new president who could work out a deal with a newly elected Congress. The lawmakers return to work next week from a lengthy recess with appropriations bills unfinished for the coming fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. By law, lawmakers must act by Sept. 30 to approve the spending bills, or the government shuts down, as it did for two weeks in 2013 when appropriations bills had not been enacted in time. In a conference call with reporters, Reid said he worried that ”we're headed straight for another unnecessary government shutdown” unless action is taken.  Congress could pass a   continuing resolution that would keep the government running at current spending levels until next year, postponing final appropriations decisions until then without shutting down the government. Reid said Democrats favored approving a shorter   bill that would let lawmakers return to Washington later this year   presumably after the Nov. 8 election   to finish spending bills. ”But we are not doing anything into next year,” he said. ”And the Republicans should be made aware of that right now.”  Reid said he had met with Obama on Wednesday, implying Obama endorsed his stance. Although Democrats are in the minority in both the Senate and House, rules requiring a supermajority for many Senate actions give Democrats significant leverage. More than two dozen conservative groups wrote to lawmakers this week saying they were worried that Congress would use what is called a ”lame duck” session immediately after the election to tack on additional spending and corporate welfare provisions to the appropriations bills. Among other things, Congress has not been able to decide how much to spend to fight the   Zika virus. The Republican leadership has not announced its plans for finishing work on spending bills. Staff members for both Republican leaders in the House and Senate said they would discuss the issue next week.

129142,193792,Callers for dollars: Inside India's scam call centers,Reuters,"Rajendra Jadhav, Euan Rocha and Rahul Bhatia",2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-fraud-usa-idUSKBN13O2XZ?il=0  ," (This November 29 story has been corrected in the penultimate paragraph to say two rupees is around three U. S. cents and not a third of a U. S. cent) By Rajendra Jadhav, Euan Rocha and Rahul Bhatia  In late September, a woman in National City, California, received a voice message on her phone saying she was in trouble with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over ”tax evasion or tax fraud”. Panicking, she rang the number and told a man who said he was from the IRS: ”I can pay $500,” half the sum demanded. ”I could do a payment plan. I just can't pay all of it at once.” ”Ma'am, you can pay $500 today itself. You can do that?” the man asked, adding that lawyers would look at her accounts and work out a monthly payment plan, but she had to pay half now. In transcripts of the conversation that investigators shared with Reuters, the man told her to keep the phone line open and drive to a nearby grocery store, where she bought $500 worth of iTunes gift cards and gave the 'agent' the redemption codes. She had just been scammed   one of at least 15, 000 people the U. S. Justice Department says lost more than $300 million in an ”enormous and complex fraud” running since 2013. The department last month brought grand jury charges against 56 people in India and the USA for ”telefraud” scams run from fake call centers in India. Investigators have arrested 20 people in the USA, and Indian authorities have made 75 arrests following October raids on three premises in the Thane suburb of Mumbai. Charges include conspiracy to commit identity theft, impersonation of an officer of the USA, wire fraud and money laundering. Indian police say they are looking for Sagar Thakkar, a man in his early 30s also known as Shaggy, who they believe masterminded the scam. Thakkar was also among those named by the U. S. Department of Justice. Reuters was unable to contact Thakkar for comment; he is not known to have a lawyer, and police believe he fled to Dubai last month. ”We are trying to complete the procedure to issue a red corner notice for Thakkar,” Parag Manere, a deputy commissioner at Thane police, told Reuters, referring to an Interpol arrest warrant. Police said Thakkar led a lavish lifestyle, frequenting   hotels and driving expensive cars with proceeds from the scam. He gave one, a 25 million rupee ($365, 000) Audi R8, to his girlfriend. ”We have seized an Audi car, and are trying to find other assets of Thakkar,” Manere said. The FBI, which is involved in the investigations, declined to comment. The Department of Justice did not respond to requests for comment for this article. At a news conference last month, Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said the U. S. would seek the extradition of suspects in India, and warned others engaged in similar schemes they could face jail terms. In interviews before the U. S. charges were filed, police, suspects and call center workers in India told Reuters how the scam was run.  Training materials and taped conversations, which investigators believe were made by call center instructors for training purposes, shed some light on an operation aimed to exploit the aged and gullible. ”TAUGHT TO BE TOUGH” ”The revenue was unpredictable. Some days were good, some were bad,” Haider Ali Ayub Mansuri, who said he managed operations at one fake call center, told Reuters as he was returned to jail in India last month after a court extended his custody. He is among the 75 arrested by Indian police. ”On a good day, we extracted as much as $20, 000 from a single U. S. citizen,” he said. In India, the sheer scale of the operation surprised many. For months, hundreds of young men and women worked nights at several call centers in Thane. Callers posed as IRS officers and threatened their victims, often   immigrants and the elderly, into paying fictitious tax penalties electronically   sometimes by buying gift cards and turning over the redemption codes, Indian investigators said. ”They used to blast out   messages to thousands of citizens who were asked to call back. When they called back, there was a center just like this,” said Manere at Thane police. Acting on a   police raided premises in early October as call center workers settled in for their shift. The buildings housed seven call centers, and over a few days more than 700 people were detained. Most have since been released, but told not to leave the city. Callers bullied their victims with the threat of arrest, jail, seized homes and confiscated passports. ”There was one instance where an old lady was crying,” because she didn't have the money to pay, said a former call center worker who spoke only on condition of anonymity. ”But we kept insisting on the money. We were taught to be tough,” he told Reuters. On a   raid in Ahmedabad, 500 kms (310 miles) north of Mumbai, police uncovered what they believe was ”a nerve center for these centers,” said Manere. ”A lot of money has been transacted. It's been going on for a few years.” The police raids found little in the way of documentation, beyond some training materials. Another former worker said this was likely because call center managers stopped employees from bringing pens and phones to work. Reuters was unable to independently confirm the accounts provided by call center workers. WEEKLY INCENTIVES Another former worker, an economics graduate, told Reuters she took a job without knowing what the center did. The 12, 000 rupee ($180) monthly salary was well below the going rate for a graduate, she said, but it was a job, and ”people aren't hiring.” She said several of her colleagues looked as though they had just left high school. Her first week was spent in training with floor managers. While callers spoke to their victims, she said dozens of trainees squeezed in around the room, and had to memorize pages of dialogue for use on calls. Another former employee said his instructors told him his work was illegal, but there was ”nothing to worry about.” Callers made ”fast money” another former caller told Reuters. In comments confirmed by investigating officer Mukund Hatote, the worker said: ”For every dollar you brought in, you were given two rupees (around three U. S. cents).” People wanted to leave rather than be involved in something they suspected was illegal, he said, but carried on because managers offered weekly incentives, such as cash or gadgets, for meeting their targets.

129146,193798,Hardline Islamists push agenda as blasphemy case ignites Indonesia,Reuters,Kanupriya Kapoor and Agustinus Beo Da Costa,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-politics-islamists-insight-idUSKBN13O2X3?il=0  ," When Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama had some of the capital's sprawling slums levelled this spring, Muslim groups including the hardline ”Islamic Defenders Front” (FPI) moved in quickly to help some of the city's poorest residents. The offer of food, shelter, clothes and money was a lifeline to the struggling families. But religious conservatives, who had long opposed Purnama because he was a Christian, did not stop there. After a video circulated in October of Purnama, also known as ”Ahok” making comments that some Muslims said insulted the Koran, the FPI went into overdrive. It called for his arrest, bombarded its social media pages with fiery messages and rallied some 150, 000 protesters to the streets of the capital earlier this month. With another mass protest slated for Dec. 2, the FPI has helped trigger a crisis that has engulfed President Joko Widodo, seen as a close ally of Purnama, and damaged the hitherto popular governor's hopes of   in a ballot in February. The FPI, which divides opinion in Indonesia, has also seized the political agenda, using the blasphemy scandal to get people on to the streets and pushing a message of intolerance in a   country where hardline posturing rarely makes waves. ”Most victims of evictions are Muslim and they're already resisting that, quite apart from the blasphemy,” Novel Chaidir Bamukmin, head of the FPI's Jakarta chapter, told Reuters. ”So on top of that, there's an insult to their religion. That just makes their spirit stronger. We had already been resisting Ahok for years. The blasphemy is the peak of the problem and our resistance.” The FPI said it wants Friday's demonstration to be peaceful, but minorities, including Christians and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community are fearful of the group. [nL4N1AQ2D9] Around 50 FPI members barged into a Jakarta apartment at the weekend to break up what they said was a gay sex party. The group has vowed to continue to target the LGBT community. [nL4N1DT27P] A worried Widodo has moved to soothe foreign investors, whose money is key to the economy. While seeing no disruption yet to business and suggesting tensions may ease after city elections, they are nonetheless wary. ”In an overwhelmingly tolerant country . .. a small group of hardliners seem to be able to push their agenda, and you have to question what direction the country is headed in,” said a foreign business leader in Jakarta who declined to be named. CANCELLED TRIP, SOOTHING WORDS Widodo postponed a visit to Australia soon after the Nov. 4 demonstrations, the largest in Jakarta in years. Throughout November he has held talks with top political, religious and military officials to quell talk of instability, and announced he would ”prevent the growth of radicalism”. Last week, helicopters dropped police leaflets over the capital warning residents they faced harsh penalties if new rallies turned violent. The Nov. 4 march was largely peaceful, but sporadic clashes broke out and police fired water cannon and tear gas to control crowds. One person died and over 100 were wounded. [nL4N1D51Y3] Widodo blamed ”political actors” for fanning the unrest. It was an apparent reference to the opposition, which has been accused of using groups like the FPI to hurt not only Purnama's election chances but also Widodo's, by casting doubt over his suitability to lead for a second term. Opposition leaders denied those accusations in local media. But the FPI could turn up pressure further now that the debate is about Islam and the Koran and not just about how Jakarta is run. ”If a member of my family was insulted, I would be angry, let alone my holy book,” said Muhammad Ridla, 31, who travelled with others from Bandung, a city three hours away, to join the   rally on Nov. 4. ”When that happens, even a person who has a shallow faith like me would be upset.” SOCIAL MEDIA ”JIHAD” Purnama has been in the Islamists' sights for years. The FPI believes a Christian, who is also ethnic Chinese, should not hold the powerful position of running the city of 10 million people. The group, which says it has about five million members, has a history of harassing minorities. In recent years, they have forced the closure of churches and mosques run by   Muslims, raided bars, and caused the cancellation of a 2012 Lady Gaga concert to ”protect Indonesians from sin”. When some Jakarta slums were razed in March and April, the FPI encouraged those evicted to form small ” ” groups to demonstrate against clearances, Bamukmin said. Some later joined the Nov. 4 protest. In September, when the case of alleged blasphemy first surfaced, FPI leaders ratcheted up their rhetoric against the governor, calling for his arrest and preaching in mosques that ”blasphemy is  ”. The group also began publishing posts hourly, as opposed to two or three times a day, on Facebook, Twitter and in newsletters to express its outrage. Their online feeds are now crammed with   traffic, as well as some against Widodo himself, and many posts are being liked,   or commented on thousands of times. By comparison, the country's biggest moderate Muslim organisation, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) barely mentions the blasphemy case on its social media pages. ”In trying to get   million people (to protest) the majority of it was based on social media,” Bamukmin explained. ”We have called it 'jihad on social media'.” As anger grew, the FPI joined an umbrella group that included other Muslim organisations like NU. It used extensive networks in towns and villages to swell numbers on Nov. 4. POLL BLOW TO PURNAMA Purnama has plenty of supporters, especially among the large middle class who liked the way he cut bureaucracy, tried to   gridlocked streets and spoke his mind. He denies blasphemy, but has apologized for comments made during a speech in September about his opponents' use of the Koran in political campaigning. An incorrectly subtitled version of the speech went viral online where Purnama appeared to be criticizing the Koran rather than his rivals. Police have opened an investigation into the allegations and questioned Purnama, while prosecutors are expected to bring a case to court in the coming weeks. Almost without exception, blasphemy cases in Indonesia end with conviction. Purnama, who is running against two Muslim candidates in February's election, has slipped to second place as his popularity ebbs, some recent polls showed. Widodo, who preceded Purnama as the capital's governor, is seen by many Indonesians as an ally and friend, and the ruling party and coalition continue to back Purnama. But the president has publicly distanced himself, saying repeatedly that he would not protect him in the investigation. MINORITIES UNEASY Widodo has faced criticism from rights activists and his own supporters for allowing hardline Islamists to strongarm the government, and many see the blasphemy probe as an attack on Indonesia's religiously and ethnically diverse society.   who officially account for just over 1 percent of the country's population, feel a sense of vulnerability reminiscent of 1998, when the fall of strongman Suharto unleashed widespread violence in the capital. Hundreds of people were killed and thousands of ethnic Chinese fled the country, as mobs rampaged through Jakarta targeting   stores and homes. Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population but recognizes six religions and is home to dozens of ethnic groups and people who adhere to traditional beliefs. Support for Purnama has been trending on social media, where some, like Twitter user @gunardi, have expressed sympathy. ”If anything, he will get a lot more sympathy as someone who has been tyrannized,” the user said. It remains to be seen if those voices are drowned out in the coming weeks. A rally in Jakarta held after Nov. 4 to ”celebrate Indonesia's diversity” drew around 2, 000 people.

129170,193842,Bolivia suspends airline as Colombian crash probe points to lack of fuel,Reuters,Daniel Ramos and Fredy Builes,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-colombia-crash-idUSKBN13P0F2?il=0  ," Bolivian authorities on Thursday suspended the license of a tiny charter airline whose plane crashed in Colombia this week after apparently running out of fuel, killing 71 people and wiping out a Brazilian soccer team on its way to a regional cup final. Monday night's disaster sent shock waves across the global soccer community and plunged Brazil, Latin America's largest nation, into mourning. The small Chapecoense team was traveling on a charter flight operated by airline LAMIA Bolivia to the biggest game in its history, the final of the Copa Sudamericana. Investigators combing the crash site on a wooded hillside outside of Medellin found no traces of fuel in the wreckage of the BAe 146 made by Britain's BAE Systems Plc, signaling that the crash may have resulted from lack of fuel.  International flight regulations require aircraft to carry enough reserve fuel to fly for 30 minutes after reaching their destination.  ”In this case, sadly, the aircraft did not have enough fuel to meet the regulations for contingency,” said Freddy Bonilla, secretary of airline security at Colombia's aviation authority.    Bolivian authorities said they were suspending LAMIA's operating license and replacing the management of its aviation authority to ensure a transparent investigation. It said that neither decision implied wrongdoing. Local media in Brazil, citing an internal document, reported an official at the Bolivian aviation agency called Celia Castedo raised concerns about LAMIA's flight plan. The official urged the airline to come up with an alternative route because the 4 hour and 22 minute journey was the same length as the plane's maximum flight range. The reports said the official, who could not be reached by Reuters for comment, did not have the power to stop the flight. A Colombian civil aviation document seen by Reuters confirmed the flight time was set to be 4 hours and 22 minutes. Medellin air traffic controllers asked the LAMIA pilot to wait while another flight made an emergency landing. Details on the length of the wait and problems with the other flight were not immediately available. Air traffic controller Yaneth Molina, who received the distress call, said in a letter written to colleagues that she had received death threats following the crash. ”I did all that was humanly possible and technically necessary to preserve the lives of the passengers, but unfortunately my efforts weren't enough,” Molina wrote in her letter, which was later released to the press. A crackling recording obtained by Colombian media of Bolivian pilot Miguel Quiroga's final words showed he told the control tower at Medellin's airport that the plane was ”in total failure, total electrical failure, without fuel.”  He requested urgent permission to land, and then the audio went silent. LAMIA Chief Executive Officer Gustavo Vargas on Wednesday said the plane had been correctly inspected before departure and should have had enough fuel for about    hours. In such situations, it is at the pilot's discretion whether to refuel, Vargas said.  Only 0. 5 percent of accidents on record were blamed on low fuel, according to the U. S.  Flight Safety Foundation. BRAZIL GRIEVES In the soccer club's small farming hometown of Chapeco in southern Brazil, workers on Thursday erected temporary structures in the stadium to shelter the coffins of 51 victims   players, staff and journalists   expected to arrive back for an   wake on Saturday. Some 100, 000 fans, about half the city's population, were expected to attend, as were Brazilian President Michel Temer and Gianni Infantino, president of world soccer governing body FIFA. On Wednesday night, when the Copa Sudamericana final had been scheduled, tens of thousands of fans assembled in tribute at Chapecoense's arena and the stadium in Medellin of rival team Atletico Nacional.  ”We Brazilians will never forget the way in which Colombians have felt as their own the pain of this terrible disaster that ended the historic dream of Chapecoense,” Foreign Minister Jose Serra told the crowds in Medellin. Fox Sports Brasil, which lost six of its journalists in the crash, broadcast 90 minutes of a black screen in the time slot of Wednesday's game. A spokesman for Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch said an inspector for the agency and Colombian officials would transport the aircraft's black boxes back to the United Kingdom, where the information will be downloaded. Only six on board the flight survived: three Chapecoense team members, a journalist and two Bolivian crew members. Some have wondered why Chapecoense used the charter company instead of a commercial airline. Club Vice President Luiz Antonio Palaoro said LAMIA had a track record of transporting soccer teams around South America, and it had used the airline before.  ”We are dealing with the humanitarian aspect of the families and the victims,” Palaoro told reporters in Chapeco. ”After that, we are going to have to think about restructuring the team and also the appropriate legal measures.” Among surviving players, goalkeeper Jackson Follmann's right leg was amputated, while defender Helio Neto was in intensive care with severe trauma to his skull, thorax and lungs. Fellow defender Alan Ruschel had spinal surgery.  Two of the Bolivian flight crew, Ximena Suarez and Erwin Tumiri, were bruised but not in critical condition, while journalist Rafael Valmorbida was treated in intensive care for multiple rib fractures that partly collapsed a lung. Tumiri may soon be released, local press reported.

129198,193886,Trump to nominate retired General Mattis for Pentagon,Reuters,Phil Stewart,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-defense-idUSKBN13Q5RU  ," U. S.   Trump said on Thursday night he would nominate retired Marine Corps General James Mattis, known as ”Mad Dog” and renowned for his tough talk and battlefield experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, to lead the Pentagon. ”We are going to appoint 'Mad Dog' Mattis as our secretary of defense,” Trump told a rally in Cincinnati. He said the formal announcement would be made on Monday. The choice of a seasoned military strategist would be another indication that Trump, a Republican, intends to steer U. S. foreign policy away from Democratic Obama's increased reliance on U. S. allies to fight Islamist militants and to help deter Russian and Chinese aggression in Europe and Asia. Mattis is a revered figure in the Marine Corps and known for his distrust of Iran. The Washington Post and CNN reported earlier that Trump had chosen Mattis, but Trump spokesman Jason Miller said earlier on Twitter that ”no decision has been made yet with regard to Secretary of Defense.” While the nomination of the    Mattis would likely be popular among U. S. forces, it would have to clear a bureaucratic hurdle.   Because he retired only in 2013, Mattis would need the U. S. Congress to waive a requirement that a defense secretary be a civilian for at least seven years before taking the top job at the Pentagon. His impressive combat record, however, may deter some Senate Democrats from trying to block his nomination. Trump has described Mattis as ”a true general's general.”  The NY real estate magnate famously asserted last year: ”I know more about ISIS than the generals do.” Mattis, whose past assignments include leading Central Command, which oversees U. S. military operations in the Middle East and South Asia, is known for his colorful expressions that unashamedly embrace the job of the U. S. armed forces: fighting wars. In one famous line in 2003 attributed to Mattis, the general told Marines in Iraq: ”Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.” TOUGH TALK In a 2016    session, Mattis appeared to be moved by a Marine's question about how far out he could inflict casualties with his knife hand, known as a ”  radius.” ”Once you get to be a   officer, the   radius is whatever your Marines make it, and by the time I got up to the senior ranks it was hundreds of miles,” he said in a video for the Marine Corps. Still, such tough talk has gotten him in hot water. He was once rebuked for saying in 2005 that ”it's fun to shoot some people.”  His talk, however, belies a more thoughtful side. Mattis once said the most important 6 inches in a combat zone was ”between your ears.” Now a fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, Mattis is also a scholar who was praised by  . S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates in 2010 as one of the country's great strategic thinkers.  Mattis reads avidly, frequently quotes history and is proud that he grew up with a large library and no television.  After meeting Mattis on Nov. 19, Trump described him as a strong, dignified man who persuasively argued against waterboarding, an interrogation tactic that involves pouring water over someone's face to simulate drowning.  Trump had promised during the campaign he would not only revive use of waterboarding, which is widely regarded as torture and was banned under Obama, but bring back ”a hell of a lot worse” if elected.  ”(Mattis) said: 'I've always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture.' And I was very impressed by that answer,” Trump told The NY Times. WARY OF IRAN       The Senate Armed Services Committee will consider Mattis' nomination. In a statement on Thursday night, its chairman, Republican John McCain, called him ”one of the finest military officers of his generation and an extraordinary leader.”  Mattis would be the first former U. S. general to become defense secretary since George C. Marshall took the job in 1950. The decision adds to Trump's national security team another Pentagon veteran who served during the Obama administration but often had a testy relationship with it. Officials who knew him before he retired in 2013 said Mattis clashed with top administration officials when he headed Central Command over his desire to better prepare for potential threats from Iran and to win more resources for Afghanistan. Trump has given the job of national security adviser to Michael Flynn, a retired   Army general who was pushed out of the top job at the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 by Obama's administration.  Flynn was fiercely critical of Obama during the 2016 campaign, adopting much of Trump's rhetoric. Along with Flynn and Trump's choice for CIA director, U. S. Representative Mike Pompeo, Mattis has been critical of the deal to curb Iran's suspected nuclear weapons program, saying the threat from Tehran should outrank more immediate concerns about ISIS or al Qaeda. ”The Iranian regime, in my mind, is the single most enduring threat to stability and peace in the Middle East,” Mattis said. Speaking about the Iranian nuclear deal, Mattis said: ”Hoping that Iran is on the cusp of becoming a responsible, modern nation is a bridge too far.” If Mattis wins Senate confirmation, he will work side by side with another Marine   General Joseph Dunford, who is chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Having two Marine generals in those top jobs would be highly unusual for a service that prides itself on being the most elite U. S. fighting force. It would also raise questions about how Mattis and Dunford might divide up tasks.  Both Dunford and Mattis share battlefield experience, including in Iraq. In 2003, Mattis led the 1st Marine Division during the U. S.  invasion of Iraq. He has said one of the toughest things he had to do was oversee the retreat of his forces from the city of Falluja in 2004, something he feared would hurt morale, but did not. ”We just don't take refuge in   or any of that kind of stuff. And so as a result, the Marine Corps remains a very feared organization in this world. As it should be,” he said.

129199,193887,Grim Hollande says he won't seek second term as French president,Reuters,Ingrid Melander,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-hollande-idUSKBN13Q5F0  ," President Francois Hollande shocked France on Thursday by announcing he would not seek a second term next year, acknowledging his deep unpopularity and making way for another leftist candidate to take on conservative Francois Fillon and   leader Marine Le Pen. The surprise announcement   effectively an admission that by running again he would hurt his Socialist party's chances   marks the first time since France's fifth Republic was created in 1958 that an incumbent president has not sought a second mandate. ”I am aware today of the risk that going down a route that would not gather sufficient support would entail, so I have decided not to be a candidate in the presidential election,” a   Hollande said in a televised address. Dogged by high unemployment, Hollande is the least popular president in French polling history, yet his closest aides had consistently said he would run. After Britain's shock vote to quit the EU and the U. S. choice of Trump as president, the election next April and May is on course to turn into another test of voters' anger with traditional elites, with Le Pen tapping into frustration with immigrants, austerity and the EU. The past two weeks have turned French politics on its head. First former president Nicolas Sarkozy was knocked out of the conservatives' primary, and then runaway favorite Alain Juppe was beaten to the party's nomination by Fillon, a reformist in the mold of Britain's Margaret Thatcher. Hollande's retreat makes it likely that his prime minister, Manuel Valls, will throw his hat in the ring to take part in the Socialist primaries in January. ”In doing this, I'm facing my responsibilities,” said Hollande.   and   he called for all people with a ”progressive” political viewpoint to unite. He also warned about the rise of populism and the far right. ”I do not want France to be exposed to risks which would cost it dear, and even threaten its unity, its cohesion, its social balance,” he said. Earlier in the day, Hollande had gone about business as usual, including congratulating Olympic medalists with a warm smile at a ceremony in the morning. He called just a few people, including Valls, in the afternoon, to tell them he would not stand for   someone close to Hollande said. DIVIDED LEFT   There has been tension in the past week between the president and the prime minister, who raised the possibility in a weekend interview that he might be a candidate in the election. All Valls said on Thursday night was that Hollande had made ”the choice of a statesman”. The Left is deeply divided as it approaches the election. Several other Socialists, including former economy minister Arnaud Montebourg, have said they will take part in the party's primaries in January.   Those primaries will now likely pit Valls' centrist, more liberal line against the more   views of the other candidates in the primaries, analysts said. ”This opens up all possible scenarios and will free up tensions and rivalries within the Left, which, a few months before the presidentials, is the scenario of maximum danger for the Left,” said Viavoice pollster Francois  . Another of Hollande's   Emmanuel Macron, and leftist firebrand   Melenchon have said they will run in the presidential election, but without taking part in the primaries.    Conservative Fillon said Hollande's mandate had ended ”in political shambles and decay”. UNPOPULAR LEADER    Hollande beat conservative incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy in an election in May 2012 after a classic leftwing campaign in which he targeted big business and pledged to raise taxes for high earners.  But his popularity soon began to decline with a perceived lack of leadership and   on key issues, particularly tax reform, which dismayed many on the left. His popularity has also been undermined by stubbornly high unemployment and anemic economic growth. Grassroots supporters were further alienated by a   switch in 2014, a wavering over security reforms, and by labor laws that brought thousands out onto the streets in protests early this year. Hollande's image was also hit by a series of communication missteps, including a very public split with his   Valerie Trierweiler and pictures of him going to visit his new partner on a scooter. The last straw for some of his closest supporters was the publication of a book by two Le Monde journalists in October. In interviews with them, Hollande criticized several of his allies and others from judges to footballers, in comments that were widely criticized as indiscreet and   a president. He also disclosed that French secret services had carried out four targeted killings on his orders.

129201,193889,"Obama, trying to protect legacy, unlikely to act on Mideast peace",Reuters,Arshad Mohammed and Matt Spetalnick,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-usa-idUSKBN13Q5MD  ," U. S. Obama, keen to preserve his legacy on domestic health care and the Iran nuclear deal, is not expected to make major moves on   peace before leaving office, U. S. officials said on Thursday. One official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the last word on the president's failed peace effort might come from StateSecretary John Kerry at an appearance on Sunday at an annual Middle East conference in Washington. Obama's aides are wary of being seen picking a fight with Trump at a time when he hopes to persuade the Republican   to preserve parts of his legacy, including the Iran nuclear deal, Obamacare and the opening to Cuba. While Obama has yet to present his final decision, several officials said he had given no sign that he intended to go against the consensus of his top advisers, who have mostly urged him not to take dramatic steps, a second official said.  ”There is no evidence that there is any muscle behind (doing) anything,” said a third official. Putting new pressure on Israel could be seen as a vindictive parting shot by Obama at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the first official said, noting they have had a testy relationship. There is concern that Trump, in response, might   in trying to demonstrate his own   credentials, for example by moving the U. S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, a step that would enrage Palestinians and create an international furor. Officials said Obama has weighed enshrining his own outline for a deal in a U. N. Security Council resolution that would live on after he gives way to Trump on Jan. 20. Another idea was to give a speech laying out such parameters. These options appear to have lost steam. Kerry, who led the last round of peace talks that collapsed in 2014, appears on Sunday at the Saban Forum conference of U. S. Israeli and Arab officials. Officials could not rule out that Obama might also talk about   diplomacy before he leaves office. The White House and the Israeli embassy declined comment. The central issues to be resolved in the conflict include borders between Israel and a future Palestinian state, the fate of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, which most nations regard as illegal, the fate of Palestinian refugees and the status of Jerusalem. Israeli officials remain concerned that Obama and his aides have not explicitly ruled out some kind of   U. S. action, either at the United Nations or in another public forum.     U. S. officials said Obama could also have his hand forced, notably if another nation like France put forward a U. N. Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlement activity as illegal or illegitimate, daring Washington to veto it as it did a similar   resolution in 2011. U. S. ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro, asked if Washington would again veto a French proposal, told Israel's Army Radio: ”We will always oppose unilateral proposals.” He added: ”If there is something more balanced, I cannot guess what the response will be.”  (Additional reporting by Jeffrey Heller in Jerusalem; Editing by Yara Bayoumy and James Dalgleish) QAMISHLI,   The head of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia said on Wednesday that Turkish military deployments near   areas of northwestern Syria amounted to a ”declaration of war” which could trigger clashes within days.

129202,193890,Johnson & Johnson hit with over $1 billion verdict on hip implants,Reuters,Erica Teichert,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-johnson-johnson-verdict-hipimplants-idUSKBN13Q5XF  ,"The jurors found that the    Pinnacle hip implants were defectively designed and that the companies failed to warn consumers about the risks. J&J, which faces more than 8, 000 lawsuits over the hip implants, said in a statement it would immediately appeal the verdict and was committed to defending itself and DePuy from further litigation over the Pinnacle devices. The six plaintiffs awarded more than $1 billion are California residents who were implanted with the hip devices and experienced tissue death, bone erosion and other injuries they attributed to design flaws. Plaintiffs claimed the companies promoted the devices as lasting longer than devices that include ceramic or plastic materials. Both companies denied any wrongdoing stemming from the development and marketing of the devices. According to plaintiff's lawyer Mark Lanier, the total verdict of $1. 041 billion included $32 million in compensatory damages. The rest were punitive damages. Verdicts of such size are often scaled back by courts. In July, the judge presiding over this case, U. S. District Judge Edward Kinkeade, reduced a $500 million verdict in an earlier Pinnacle implant case to $151 million, citing a Texas state law that limits punitive damages awards. J&J and DePuy have been hit with nearly 8, 400 lawsuits over the devices, which have been consolidated in Texas federal court. Test cases have been selected for trial, and their outcomes will help gauge the value of the remaining claims. The verdict on Thursday came in the third test case, with the second producing the earlier $500 million verdict. J&J and DePuy were cleared of liability in the first test case in 2014  Lanier said Thursday's verdict was ”a message loud and clear” that J&J has ”a really nasty part of their business they need to clean up.”  The company rejected a $1. 8 million settlement offer from the plaintiffs before trial, Lanier said. The plaintiffs in the second test case have appealed Kinkeade's decision to cut the award. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy have also appealed the jury verdict in the case. In its statement, J&J criticized the trial judge over certain rulings it claimed help the plaintiffs.  “Today's verdict provides no guidance on the merits of the overall Pinnacle litigation because the court's rulings precluded a fair presentation to the jury,” said John Beisner, J&J's attorney. He said the company will ask the appeals court to postpone any additional trials over the implant defects. DePuy ceased selling the    Pinnacle devices in 2013 after the U. S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations.  J&J and DePuy also paid $2. 5 billion that year to settle more than 7, 000 lawsuits over its ASR    hip devices. The ASR devices were recalled in 2010 due to high failure rates.  J&J shares fell 38 cents to $111 in   trading. They had closed up 8 cents during the day. U.

129203,193892,Trump takes populist message to U.S. heartland in 'thank you' tour,Reuters,Emily Stephenson,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-idUSKBN13Q5HT?il=0  ,"   Trump kicked off his   ”thank you tour” on Thursday by railing against globalization, promising the return of manufacturing jobs to American workers, and vowing to shut U. S. borders to some Middle East migrants. Speaking in an arena that was about   full, Trump rallied the crowd by repeatedly attacking the ”extremely dishonest” media and invoking the populist message that resonated with millions of voters. ”There is no global anthem, no global currency, no certificate of global citizenship. We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag,” Trump said. ”From now on it's going to be America first, okay?” Trump said as he stressed   spurred by trade deals he intends to renegotiate, including the North American Free Trade Agreement. The NY real estate magnate also announced that he would nominate Marine General James Mattis   calling him ”Mad Dog Mattis”   to be his secretary of defense. Noting an attack on the Ohio State University campus in Columbus earlier this week by a Somali immigrant, Trump said such threats against Americans were ”created by our very, very stupid politicians; refugee programs.” In order to keep the USA safe from further attacks, Trump said he will suspend immigration ”from regions where it cannot be safely processed,” including some countries in the Middle East. ”People are pouring in from regions of the Middle East. We have no idea who they are, where they come from, what they're thinking and we're going to stop that dead, cold flat,” Trump said. In the past, Trump also has said he would stop the entry of all Muslims into the USA. In a Twitter message earlier on Thursday, Trump said: ”ISIS is taking credit for the terrible stabbing attack at Ohio State University by a Somali refugee who should not have been in our country.” The Council on   Relations accused Trump of seeking to exploit the ”tragic situation in Ohio.” SAVING JOBS Trump's remarks came at the end of a day in which he also traveled to neighboring Indiana to celebrate a decision by the Carrier Corp. an air conditioner maker, to keep about 1, 000 jobs in the USA rather than move them to Mexico. That decision came after Trump, during the long presidential campaign, publicly called on the company to retain the jobs in Indianapolis and threatened to punish American companies that move operations abroad with stiff import tariffs. The company, which is owned by United Technologies (UTX. N) still intends to move 1, 300 other jobs from Indiana to Mexico. In the   to his Jan. 20 swearing in as president, Trump is expected to tour cities in swing states, like Ohio, that contributed to his shock election victory on Nov. 8. During a nearly   speech in this southwestern Ohio city, Trump promised to deliver new tax cuts to the   roll back federal regulations that he said hurt companies and build a wall along the southwestern border with Mexico. While he promised in the speech to talk about the ”action plan” that would guide the beginning of his administration, Trump did not provide new details on policies he has been pushing since announcing his White House run in 2015. In mocking detractors who did not think he could burst through the “blue wall” of states that have typically voted for Democrats, Trump proclaimed to roaring cheers, ”We didn't break it, we shattered that sucker.” Over the past few weeks, Trump has mainly been holed up in the Trump Tower in NY City, weighing who to name to top jobs in his incoming administration. He has interviewed several candidates for secretary of state, including the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, who attacked Trump throughout the 2016 campaigns but lately has spoken glowingly of the  . On Wednesday, Trump said he would nominate former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin to lead the Treasury Department. Trump named Wilbur Ross, a billionaire known for his investments in distressed industries, as his nominee for commerce secretary. In an interview with Fox News, Trump said he has whittled a list of potential Supreme Court nominees down to ”probably three or four” and that an announcement would be made soon. A seat on the   Supreme Court has been vacant since last February, when Justice Antonin Scalia died and the   Senate refused to consider Obama's choice of Merrick Garland.  Trump stirred controversy in recent days by suggesting that those who protest the USA by burning the American flag should possibly lose their citizenship or serve a jail sentence. While flag burning is protected under the U. S. Constitution, according to a Supreme Court ruling, Trump nevertheless returned to the issue again on Thursday, telling his audience in Cincinnati: ”If people burn the American flag, there should be consequences.”  (Additional reporting by Steve Holland, Doina Chiacu and David Shepardson in Washington; Writing by Richard Cowan; Editing by Peter Cooney and Simon  ) MEXICO CITY A meeting between Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and U.

129204,193896,"Starbucks CEO steps down to focus on high-end coffee, shares fall",Reuters,Lisa Baertlein and Gayathree Ganesan,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-starbucks-moves-idUSKBN13Q5S4?il=0  ,"Schultz, who will become executive chairman in April 2017, said he would focus on building   Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world as well as setting the brand's ”social impact agenda” that includes sending employees to college and recruiting veterans. Starbucks had signaled the change in July, but its shares fell 3. 6 percent to $56. 41 in extended trading on Thursday, as investors recalled the company's decline after Schultz handed over the reins in 2000. He returned in 2008. ”Having him step down as CEO raised the anxiety level,” said Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, who said that Schultz is the heart and soul of the brand, its entrepreneurial leader and its savior. ”We're in a much better position on every level,” said Schultz, who returned for his second stint as CEO in the depths of the ”Great Recession,” when Starbucks' stock was trading below $10. Late last year, it hit an   high above $60. Schultz has put Starbucks in the national spotlight, asking customers not to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race relations. Many of the campaigns have generated controversy, but analysts have not seen a hit to financial results and the efforts have raised the profile of the coffee company and cemented Schultz's status as a national figure. ”The idea that he's replaceable, I think that's erroneous,” said Bill Smead, CEO of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, which owns Starbucks shares. He compared the change to the retirement of   McDonald's Corp ( ) CEO Ray Kroc, who turned a handful of hamburger stands into the world's biggest restaurant company.  The announcement on Thursday also came as investors worry about the restaurant industry's stubborn traffic declines. Starbucks has held up better than most, but it has not been immune.   Johnson is a former technology executive who became president and chief operating officer at Starbucks in March 2015.  Johnson has been on the Starbucks board since 2009 but most of his career was in the technology industry. He was the chief executive of Juniper Networks Inc ( ) from September 2008 to January 2014 and prior to that held several senior positions at Microsoft Corp ( ). On a conference call after the announcement, analysts pressed the company on timing and whether, with Schultz stepping aside, senior management still had the ”merchant gene.” ”Not having retail experience could be a problem over time,” said Howard Penney, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management. ”I'm not leaving the company and I'm here every day,” said Schultz, whose office is connected to Johnson's. Traffic at established Starbucks cafes fell in the last quarter, which Johnson has attributed to a change in the company's loyalty program, and Starbucks forecast a    rise in 2017   sales. The company dismissed speculation that Schultz could be preparing for a new career in politics.  ”He has no plans to run for political office, as he has said many times, and will remain with the company as Starbucks executive chairman, focusing on premium coffee,” a spokeswoman said.

129210,193904,Rule breakers face bigger possible fines from CME Group,Reuters,Tom Polansek,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cme-group-crime-fines-idUSKBN13Q5ZB?il=0  ," CME Group Inc ( ) plans to strengthen efforts to deter wrongdoing in markets by raising the maximum possible fine for rule breakers, the company said on Thursday, further raising the stakes for rogue traders following the first U. S. criminal convictions for the manipulative practice known as spoofing. The owner of the Chicago Board of Trade, NY Mercantile Exchange and other markets is preparing to increase the top monetary penalty to $5 million per offense from $1 million starting on Dec. 14, according to a notice sent to clients. The CME is making that change and others to address the ”increasing complexity of disciplinary matters,” after reviewing its procedures, the notice said. The company, a   organization, fines firms and individuals and suspends them from its markets for violations ranging from failing to supervise employees to wash trading, in which traders sell contracts to themselves to make a market look more active than it is. The U. S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and National Futures Association also oversee market participants. Lawyers and traders said the rise of computerized and algorithmic trading has complicated regulatory work due to the large quantity and speed of transactions. Regulators have focused recently on spoofing, after a provision against the trading practice was implemented as part of the 2010   financial reform, lawyers said. Spoofing usually involves using algorithms to place orders with the intent to cancel them before execution. By creating an illusion of demand, spoofers can influence prices. ”Previously, traders were on the floor, trading physical products,” said Braden Perry, who was formerly a senior trial attorney for the CFTC. ”It's a whole new world now.” Raising the maximum fine helps the CME address ”the realities of the world that sometimes a $1 million penalty might not be enough to deter a certain kind of behavior,” said Perry, a partner at the law firm Kennyhertz Perry in Kansas City, Missouri. The CME notice said it wanted to make its rules ”more applicable to the types of disciplinary cases going through the enforcement process.” A company spokeswoman said the notice referred to all types of cases and that CME was changing disciplinary procedures ”to increase the deterrent effect of the penalties.” Bill Harts, chief executive of Modern Markets Initiative, which represents   traders, said algorithmic trading had not made disciplinary matters more complex. ”When trades are executed by computer, there is a robust, immutable audit trail that is simple for regulators to look at, analyze, and act on,” he said. Last month, a British trader, Navinder Sarao, became the second person convicted of spoofing U. S. futures markets. The first, Michael Coscia, is appealing his conviction.

129212,193906,"Exclusive: How Putin, Khamenei and Saudi prince got OPEC deal done",Reuters,"Rania El Gamal, Parisa Hafezi and Dmitry Zhdannikov",2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-opec-meeting-idUSKBN13Q4WG?il=0  ," Russian President Vladimir Putin played a crucial role in helping OPEC rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia set aside differences to forge the cartel's first deal with   Russia in 15 years. Interventions ahead of Wednesday's OPEC meeting came at key moments from Putin, Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani, OPEC and   sources said. Putin's role as intermediary between Riyadh and Tehran was pivotal, testament to the rising influence of Russia in the Middle East since its military intervention in the Syrian civil war just over a year ago. It started when Putin met Saudi Prince Mohammed in September on the sidelines of a G20 gathering in China. The two agreed to cooperate to help world oil markets clear a glut that had more than halved oil prices since 2014, pummeling Russian and Saudi government revenues. Oil prices are up 10 pct this week topping $53 a barrel. The financial pain made a deal possible despite the huge political differences between Russia and Saudi over the civil war in Syria. ”Putin wants the deal. Full stop. Russian companies will have to cut production,” said a Russian energy source briefed on the discussions. In September, OPEC agreed in principle at a meeting in Algiers to reduce output for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis. But the individual country commitments required to finalize a deal at Wednesday's Vienna meeting still required much diplomacy. Recent OPEC meetings have failed because of arguments between de facto leader Saudi Arabia and   producer Iran. Tehran has long argued OPEC should not prevent it restoring output lost during years of Western sanctions. Proxy wars in Syria and Yemen have exacerbated decades of tensions between the Saudi Sunni kingdom and the Iranian Shi'ite Islamic republic. BRINKMANSHIP Heading into the meeting, the signs were not good. Oil markets went into reverse. Saudi Prince Mohammed had repeatedly demanded Iran participate in supply cuts. Saudi and Iranian OPEC negotiators had argued in circles in the   to the meeting. And, then, just a few days beforehand, Riyadh appeared back away from a deal, threatening to boost production if Iran failed to contribute cuts. But Putin established that the Saudis would shoulder the lion's share of cuts, as long as Riyadh wasn't seen to be making too large a concession to Iran. A deal was possible if Iran didn't celebrate victory over the Saudis. A phone call between Putin and Iranian President Rouhani smoothed the way. After the call, Rouhani and oil minister Bijan Zanganeh went to their supreme leader for approval, a source close to the Ayatollah said. ”During the meeting, the leader Khamenei underlined the importance of sticking to Iran's red line, which was not yielding to political pressures and not to accept any cut in Vienna,” the source said.    ”Zanganeh thoroughly explained his strategy . .. and got the leader's approval. Also it was agreed that political lobbying was important, especially with Mr. Putin, and again the Leader approved it,” said the source. On Wednesday, the Saudis agreed to cut production heavily, taking ”a big hit” in the words of energy minister Khalid     while Iran was allowed to slightly boost output. Iran's Zanganeh kept a low profile during the meeting, OPEC delegates said. Zanganeh had already agreed the deal the night before, with Algeria helping mediate, and he was careful not to make a fuss about it. After the meeting, the usually combative Zanganeh avoided any comment that might be read as claiming victory over Riyadh. ”We were firm,” he told state television. ”The call between Rouhani and Putin played a major role . .. After the call, Russia backed the cut.”   IRAQ   HITCH But OPEC would not be OPEC without a   quarrel threatening to derail the deal. Iraq became a problem. As ministerial talks got underway, OPEC's   producer insisted it could not afford to cut output, given the cost of its war against ISIS. But, facing pressure from the rest of OPEC to contribute a cut, Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar Ali   picked up the phone in front of his peers to call his prime minister, Haider  . ”Abadi said: 'Get the deal done'. And that was it,” one OPEC source said.

129214,193908,Indiana agrees $7 million tax break to keep Carrier jobs in state: company,Reuters,David Shepardson,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-utc-idUSKBN13Q55W?il=0  ," Indiana state officials have agreed to give United Technologies Corp ( ) $7 million worth of tax breaks to encourage the company to keep at least 1, 069 jobs at its Carrier unit in Indianapolis, Carrier and the state said on Thursday.   Trump has claimed credit for keeping   manufacturing jobs in the country, but the deal is less than a complete victory for the Republican who campaigned on ”putting America first.” In the election campaign, Trump vowed to impose hefty tariffs if Carrier did not reverse course on shifting jobs to Mexico. The deal means Carrier will still send an estimated 1, 300 jobs there. United Technologies chief executive Gregory Hayes said at an event that the company will invest more than $16 million over two years to keep its Indianapolis plant in the state. The Indiana Economic Development Corp said it has offered Carrier $5 million in conditional tax credits based on a plan to retain 1, 069 jobs with an average wage of $30. 91 per hour, spokeswoman Abby Gras said. She declined to say how many of those jobs are at the plant or at the company's headquarters, but the Wall Street Journal reported the deal would save about 800 of the 1, 400 jobs at the plant and about 300 at the headquarters. Indiana is also offering $1 million in training grants to support workforce development and $1 million in tax credits, Gras said. The agreement has not been finalized yet. Some other details of the deal in Vice   and Indiana Gov Pence's state were unclear but it has already been criticized on the left and right. Trump and Pence celebrated the 1, 000 jobs deal at an event in Indianapolis on Thursday, but employers elsewhere in Indiana are laying off five times as many workers because of foreign competition. Trump ”did just what he said he would do,” Pence said, recounting his push to convince Carrier to remain in Indiana. ”He made the case for America.” Neither Trump nor Pence made any reference to United Technologies' planned job cuts in Indiana. Leftist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who lost the  Democratic presidential primary to Clinton, wrote in a Washington Post   that ”it is not good enough to save some of these jobs. Trump made a promise that he would save all of these jobs, and we cannot rest until an ironclad contract is signed to ensure that all of these workers are able to continue working in Indiana.” Republican Representative Justin Amish of Michigan tweeted: ”Not the president( elect)'s job. We live in a constitutional republic, not an autocracy.   meddling shouldn't be normalized.”  Reuters reported earlier this week that United Technologies would still would proceed with plans to close its Huntington, Indiana United Technologies Electronic Controls plant that employs 700. Trump also faces pressure to prevent other job cuts. There are several other factories in Indiana that closing and Senator Joe Donnelly, a Indiana Democrat, urged him to take action to prevent other job losses. The USA has shed about 5 million manufacturing jobs since 2000. Indiana alone has lost about 150, 000 factory jobs since 2000 to about 500, 000.

129215,193909,Trump's Carrier deal worthy of 'banana' republic: Mexico official,Reuters,Alexandra Alper,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-utc-mexico-idUSKBN13Q5WX?il=0  ," U. S.   Trump's intervention to stop jobs at a plant in Indiana going to Mexico is typical of what happens in countries that Americans call ”banana” republics, a senior Mexican state official said on Thursday. Carrier, a unit of United Technologies Corp ( ) said on Thursday that state officials had pledged $7 million in tax breaks to encourage the firm to keep around 1, 100 jobs in Indianapolis after Trump stepped in to protect U. S. workers. A heating and   company, Carrier said in February it would cut some 2, 100 jobs in closing two Indiana plants and move production near to the city of Monterrey in Nuevo Leon, a state bordering Texas in northern Mexico. On the campaign trail, Trump criticized Carrier and other U. S. companies investing in Mexico as unpatriotic and threatened to impose tariffs on   goods as part of his pledge to put ”America first.” Trump's deal with Carrier created an ”uncomfortable” situation for the company, and went beyond politicians' remit, Fernando Turner, economy minister for Nuevo Leon, said in an interview. ”It's not our job. It's up to companies to take their own decisions, not politicians; that's what's done in Latin American countries that they call banana (republics) in the USA,” he said, laughing.  ”It's not something that was done up until now in the USA. But anyway, things change.” Trump has threatened to abandon the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the USA, Canada and Mexico if he cannot renegotiate better terms for the U. S.  arguing the agreement has hollowed out U. S. manufacturing to Mexico's benefit. But Turner said that Mexico had not been a winner from NAFTA. The trade deal had both failed to lift Mexican economic growth and had cost the country millions of jobs, he argued. Mexican economic growth averaged 2. 6 percent in the 22 years since NAFTA took effect in 1994, compared with 2. 5 percent for the far wealthier USA, according to World Bank data.   ”(Trump) is sending a message to (U. S.) workers, to unions that they don't need to change, that everything is fine, that Mexico is the problem. But the problem is not Mexico,” Turner added. ”They're barking up the wrong tree.” Still, Turner said Trump was ”intelligent” and his ambition to grow the U. S. economy would benefit Mexico if it came off. ”Trade between Mexico and the USA did not begin with NAFTA,” he said.  (Additional reporting by Christine Murray; Editing by Dave Graham) U.

129217,193911,Commentary: The terrifying lessons of the Philippines' vigilante president,Reuters,Peter Apps,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-duterte-philippines-commentary-idUSKBN13Q4RD  ,"Every morning in the Philippines, a handful of bodies are found littering the streets. Their faces are often covered in black plastic tape. Sometimes there are signs of torture. Usually, they have been shot in the head. Few bother police  —   they are usually suspected of being responsible. No one, frankly, should be surprised that it is happening. The country's democratically elected leader, after all, was elected promising to do just this, cracking down on what he has described as a “ ” in the country. If one world leader exemplifies some of the more alarming trends taking place in politics this decade, it is Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte. His election  —   and the policies he has pursued since entering office  —   represent a comprehensive rejection of decades, if not centuries, of   moves toward respect for human rights and the rule of law. Such legal niceties, Duterte and those around him argue, have simply given criminals and others too much space. It's the sort of sentiment that has sometimes also found its place in Trump's campaign  —   the U. S.   talked, after all, of getting “really nasty” against ISIS. In the Philippines, however, the death toll is already believed to have  . Of these, 2000 were shot in armed confrontations with the police  —   with 3000 more suffering extrajudicial executions. “The number [of drug addicts] is quite staggering and scary,” Duterte said in his inaugural State of the Nation Address. “I have to slaughter these idiots for destroying my country. ” The Filipino leader has been in power barely six months. He has another five and a half years until he next faces the poll. That his rhetoric can gain traction among voters should not itself be a surprise  —   the idea of vigilante justice clearly still has an appeal, if only evidenced by the way in which it remains such a common Hollywood theme. As mayor of Davao City for more than two decades, the Filipino president reveled in such imagery  —   he was often referred to as “The Punisher” or “Duderte Harry” the latter a reference to the cinematic vigilante “Dirty Harry” played by Clint Eastwood. As mayor, Duterte was repeatedly accused of involvement in death squads targeting both criminals and political enemies. Earlier this year, a man claiming to be a former associate accused the president of taking part in some killings and ordering others, including having a man fed to a crocodile in 2007  Nothing was ever proven, however  —   and in those days, Duterte denied direct involvement. An official inquiry published at the beginning of this year  —   and, unsurprisingly, heavily criticized  —   said it found no evidence of the reported death squad killings or Duterte's own direct involvement. Since Duterte took the presidency in June, however, he has been much more outspoken  —   as well as willing to take responsibility for what some estimate could be several thousand deaths. This week, he openly threatened to target human rights activists whom he accused of getting in the way of the purge. Such tactics appear to have cost the Philippines its   alliance with the USA  —   at least under the presidency of Obama. (The Filipino leader has said he hopes to have a rather better relationship with Trump.) Duterte has talked openly of seeking alliances with Russia and China instead; both countries are seen as more likely to let the Philippines do whatever it wishes when it comes to internal matters. Duterte is clearly an outlier. For now, however, his approach is serving him relatively well when it comes to Filipino domestic politics  —   according to one survey, he remains one of the most trusted leaders in Southeast Asia. But he is also part of a wider trend  —   one that may well be accelerating. There have always, of course, been leaders who have made a virtue of “doing what it takes” to restore order and have been relatively happy to get a reputation for sometimes brutal tactics, even if they publicly deny them. Rwandan President Paul Kagame, for example, has always said his country needs to sometimes take a tough line with those who try to destabilize it if Rwanda is to avoid a repeat of the 1994 genocide. Sri Lanka's   used sometimes brutal measures to end the civil war with Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009. After the chaos of the 1990s, Russian President Vladimir Putin has ruthlessly traded off his reputation for toughness, particularly in the   insurgency in Chechnya, where Moscow's forces have long been accused of unrestricted use of force and widespread rights abuses. Most of those leaders, however, have always sought to deny outright responsibility  —   or at least maintain a degree of deniability  —   when it comes to unquestioned acts of extrajudicial murder. By being willing to make it so explicitly a tool of government policy, Duterte has significantly moved the goalposts of what might be deemed to be acceptable in international affairs. Where he has been criticized, he has been outspoken in his response, even threatening to leave the United Nations and join a new group  —   perhaps Russian and    —   that would also include African governments keen to push back on some international human rights demands.  Earlier this year, South Africa and Burundi   quit the International Criminal Court, set up in response to the genocides of the 1990s, but which critics say has been selective in which conflicts it chooses to investigate. These trends are also, in some respects at least, clearly evident in the West. Trump talked openly of waterboarding and targeting the families of suspected militants during his campaign, although it remains uncertain whether he will pursue such policies in office. Far right European political parties and columnists have periodically called for a much tougher approach to migration, suggesting this might sometimes include the use of live ammunition to maintain potentially overwhelmed borders. What this represents is an unraveling of the   system  —   and in many respects the essential concept of basic human rights  —   enshrined in the United Nations charter signed by most progressive nations after World War Two. That commitment was always imperfect  —   and frequently desperately hypocritically imposed. Still, it has rarely been as pushed back against as it is in the Philippines today. Next year may well see the forces of Syrian President Bashar   reassert control in Syria and the unraveling of the unsuccessful U. S.  policy of supporting ineffectual opposition fighters. The USA and Europe will likely see a considerable political reaction against what had been seen as relatively fundamental rights, particularly when it comes to asylum and freedom of movement. None of those things are unnecessarily unreasonable. What the Philippines reminds us, though, is just how short a journey it might be to really tear up some of the most basic rules which had been seen as underpinning a civilized society. Worse still, it can even be popular.   The views expressed in this article are not those of Reuters News. Iraqi officials have declared that ISIS's caliphate is finished. On June 29, after months of urban warfare and U. S. air strikes, Iraqi forces say they are on the verge of expelling the militants from their last holdouts in Mosul. “Their fictitious state has fallen,” an Iraqi general told state TV after troops captured a symbolically important mosque in Mosul's old city. In Syria, U. S.  rebels are moving quickly through the eastern city of Raqqa, another capital of the   Trump and his South Korean counterpart Moon   must face North Korea's nuclear reality: Pyongyang's bomb is here to stay. When the two presidents hold their first summit on Friday, they need to drop quixotic efforts to stop Kim Jong Un from building a nuclear arsenal and instead focus on preventing its use. "
129224,193926,Russian cargo ship destroyed after launch for Space Station,Reuters,Irene Klotz,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-station-progress-idUSKBN13Q57K  ," An unmanned Russian cargo ship loaded with more than    tons of food and supplies for the International Space Station broke apart about six minutes after liftoff on Thursday, Russia's space agency Roscosmos said in a statement. A Soyuz rocket carrying the Progress capsule blasted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan as planned at 9:51 a. m. EST, a NASA TV broadcast showed. But ground control teams then lost radio contact with the rocket and most of the spacecraft fragments burned in the dense atmosphere, Roscosmos said in a statement. It added that the capsule was last confirmed flying at an altitude of about 190 km (118 miles) over the remote and unpopulated area of the Republic of Tyva. The cause of the accident is under investigation. The   crew aboard the International Space Station is not in any danger and has enough supplies for several months, NASA said. Thursday's launch was the fourth failed cargo run to the station in the past two years, including one previous Progress failure. The accident comes at a critical time because SpaceX, one of two U. S. companies flying supplies to the station for NASA, has not yet returned to flight following a Sept. 1 launch pad accident. SpaceX is awaiting approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees U. S. commercial space transportation, to fly as early as Dec. 16 with 10 satellites owned by Iridium Communications Inc. SpaceX's next cargo flight for NASA is targeted for January. Orbital ATK and Japan's space agency also fly supplies to the station, a $100 billion laboratory that flies about 250 miles (418 km) above Earth.

129225,193928,British fighters to overfly South China Sea; carriers in Pacific after 2020: envoy,Reuters,David Brunnstrom,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-southchinasea-fighters-idUSKBN13R00D  ," British fighter planes visiting Japan will fly over the South China Sea and Britain will sail aircraft carriers in the Pacific once they are operational in 2020, given concerns about freedom of navigation there, Britain's ambassador to the USA said on Thursday. The envoy, Kim Darroch, told a Washington think tank that British Typhoon aircraft currently deployed on a visit to Japan would fly across disputed parts of the South China Sea to assert international overflight rights, but gave no time frame. Speaking at an event also attended by Japan's ambassador to Washington, Darroch said that most future British defense capacity would have to be directed toward the Middle East, but added: ”Certainly, as we bring our two new aircraft carriers onstream in 2020, and as we renew and update our defense forces, they will be seen in the Pacific.  ”And we absolutely share the objective of this U. S. administration, and the next one, to protect freedom of navigation and to keep sea routes and air routes open.” In spite of Britain's preoccupations in the Middle East, ”we will try to play our part” in the Pacific, he said. Four British fighter planes arrived in Japan in October to  take part in exercises with Japanese forces at a time of rising tensions over China's pursuit of disputed territory in East Asia, including the South and East China Seas. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said all countries had freedom of navigation and overflight in  the South China Sea, in accordance with international law, and there was no dispute about that. ”We hope the relevant party can earnestly respect regional countries' efforts to safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea,” he told a daily news briefing.  A commentary on the official Chinese news agency Xinhua took a stronger tone, saying   ties could be hurt. ”Such remarks create the impression that London may soon deviate from a largely aloof attitude over the South China Sea issue and start playing a meddling role there like the USA and Japan,” it said. ”Should a British warplane embark on a   ”freedom of navigation” mission in the South China Sea, it would only serve to further complicate the issue and weigh on thriving   ties.” Japan's ambassador, Kenichiro Sasae, said the USA, Japan and Britain discussed greater naval cooperation at a meeting at the Pentagon in October and Tokyo welcomed greater British involvement in Asian security. Darroch said British Prime Minister Theresa May and U. S.   Trump discussed the importance of all NATO members meeting their defense spending commitments in a telephone call this week, their second since Trump's Nov. 8 election. Darroch said all NATO states had committed to spending at least 2 percent of GDP on defense, yet only five, including the USA and Britain, were doing so. ”I think the criticism . .. during this election campaign that a number of NATO countries aren't doing everything they can . .. is entirely fair and we will see how the incoming administration wants to take that forward,” he said. Trump has criticized European NATO members for not meeting their spending commitments and has also called on U. S. Asian allies Japan and South Korea to pay more for their defense or risk the alliances. Trump has said he plans to build up the U. S. military, and advisers have said he will pursue a policy of ”peace through strength” in the Pacific in the face of China's growing assertiveness. The advisers say Trump can also be expected to take a more  ”robust” approach to naval operations to assert navigation rights in the South China Sea, a vital global trade route.

129229,193934,Trump considering Senator Heitkamp of North Dakota for Cabinet: source,Reuters,Ernest Scheyder,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-heitkamp-idUSKBN13Q5O0  ,"   Trump is considering Democratic U. S. Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota for either the interior or energy secretary positions in his Cabinet, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. Trump is also considering Joe Manchin, another conservative Democratic senator who represents the coal state of West Virginia, and Gary Cohn, president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc, for energy secretary, U. S. media reported on Thursday. Reuters previously reported that Trump planned to meet with Heitkamp on Friday, according to his transition team. Trump requested the meeting with Heitkamp, the source said.  In a statement, Heitkamp said she appreciated ”the   inviting me for a meeting,” adding she hoped to ”work with the   and all of my colleagues in Congress on both sides of the aisle to best support my state.”  The statement did not address whether a Cabinet position was being discussed, but Heitkamp's spokeswoman, Abbie McDonough, said the senator ”has a long record of working with both Republicans and Democrats.” Heitkamp, along with Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, negotiated a deal in Congress last December to lift the   ban on crude oil exports in exchange for a    extension of tax credits for wind and solar energy. Heitkamp has been a supporter of domestic energy development, both in fossil fuels and renewable resources.      North Dakota is a major source of crude oil, coal and wind power. Heitkamp is popular in her home state, though not all North Dakota state politicians voiced full support for the senator potentially joining the Trump administration. ”I don't see (Heitkamp) being in any Cabinet position,” Wayne Stenehjem, a Republican and North Dakota's attorney general, told Reuters.  She was elected to the Senate in 2012 in a close race, putting her up for   in two years. Should she join the Cabinet, her Senate seat would be filled by an appointment by North Dakota's Republican governor. Republicans expect to hold 52 seats in the   chamber when the new Congress meets in January. 'SERIOUS ABOUT COAL' Politico, citing unnamed sources, said Manchin was being considered for energy secretary. It quoted one of the sources as saying Manchin ”is being considered to show the coal people how serious Trump is about coal.” Politico said Manchin told the website that he and his staff had not been contacted by Trump's transition team, adding: ”If I can do anything that would help my state of West Virginia, and my country, I would be happy to talk to anybody.” Manchin's office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Manchin is up for   in 2018 in West Virginia, an increasingly Republican state where coal jobs have been threatened by cheaper natural gas prices. His 2012 election campaign stressed his opposition to climate change legislation that would have brought federal incentives for the USA to transition to   energy sources and away from fossil fuels such as coal. Reuters had reported on Wednesday that Goldman's Cohn was being considered to head the White House budget office or another post in the Trump administration. Citing unnamed sources, Fox Business Network reported on Thursday that Trump was also considering nominating Cohn to head the Energy Department. Cohn met with Trump in NY on Tuesday. Cohn, a former Goldman commodities trader who joined the firm in 1990, has been widely considered to be the heir apparent to Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein. Another reported contender for the Energy and Interior positions, Oklahoma oil magnate Harold Hamm, said on Thursday he would recommend that Trump nominate Republican U. S. Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, one of the  's energy advisers, for energy secretary.  ”I've put his name forward,” Hamm said on CNBC's ”Squawk on the Street” program. ”He'd sort of do a better job in that post than me.”  (Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Additional reporting by Valerie Volcovici and Richard Cowan in Washington; Editing by Jonathan Oatis, Peter Cooney and Bill Rigby) MEXICO CITY A meeting between Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and U.

For Mattis to be confirmed, the Senate and the House of Representatives both must pass a waiver exempting him from a law written when the Department of Defense was created to ensure that the military is under civilian command. Legislators have granted such a waiver only once, in 1950, when Congress passed an act that allowed General George Marshall, who had retired in 1945, to serve as Pentagon chief.   The    Mattis, who is revered by fellow Marines, retired    years ago. The 1947 National Security Act requires a   gap between active duty military service and the Cabinet position, leaving the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff as the Pentagon's top uniformed military position. Another Marine general, Joseph Dunford, is the current chairman, serving a   term that ends in  . Mattis was once Dunford's commander. Lawrence Korb, who was an assistant secretary of defense under Republican President Ronald Reagan, said having a military officer as secretary of defense would rob the Pentagon of needed perspective. He noted, for example, that social change in the military   from ending segregation to allowing women in combat   has always been pushed by civilians. ”I don't think it's a good idea to have a military person as secretary of defense,” he said Friday in a telephone interview. Trump takes office on Jan. 20. After Trump announced his selection on Thursday, Democrats joined many Republicans, who control majorities in both houses of Congress, to heap praise on Mattis.  DEMOCRATS' CONCERNS But a few also raised concerns about having too many generals in the top tiers of the government. Trump's choice for national security adviser is Michael Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. The   is also said to be considering David Petraeus, another retired Army general, as secretary of state, and retired Marine General John Kelly to head the Department of Homeland Security.  Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of NY, a Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said on Thursday she would not back a waiver for Mattis.  Chris Murphy, another Senate Democrat, said on Friday he was ”deeply fearful” that the precedent of civilian control of the military could wither, although he would talk to Mattis and spoke highly of the military leader. ”It would be a really dangerous precedent to break here,” he told a news conference in Connecticut, his home state. Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, had high praise for Mattis but said the House should perform a full review, including committee hearings, if it were to consider overriding the prohibition on recent military officers leading the Pentagon. ”Civil control of the military is not something to be casually cast aside,” Smith said in a statement.

Earlier on Friday, CNBC reported that Pandora is now open to selling itself and willing to engage with Sirius XM.

Pandora faces stiff competition from services such as Sweden's Spotify, Apple Inc's Apple Music, Google's Play Music and Amazon. com Inc's Amazon Music Unlimited, which dominate the   music service market. An acquisition by Sirius XM would help give Pandora a bigger foothold in cars and also allow Sirius XM to expand its Internet and mobile presence.

S. business of German semiconductor equipment maker Aixtron ( ) because the deal posed a risk to American national security, the Treasury Department said on Friday. Obama's executive order barring China's Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund (FGC) from completing the acquisition of a German company with American assets was one of few such instances in which a U. S. president has blocked a transaction due to national security concerns.  His action appeared to be based on concerns about China gaining access to the secrets of producing a material called gallium nitride used in military equipment. In 2012, Obama ordered Ralls Corp, owned by China's Sany Group, to sell its interest in wind farms near sensitive U. S. naval installations in Oregon. An Aixtron spokesman said the FGC deal would be called off if Obama took such action. Aixtron has said scrapping the proposed deal would mean it would have to take action to balance income and costs, including potential job cuts. The Treasury Department said Obama was blocking the deal following an assessment by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the USA (CFIUS) an   task force that the department leads.  ”The national security risk posed by the transaction relates, among other things, to the military applications of the overall technical body of knowledge and experience of Aixtron, a producer and innovator of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and technology,” the department said. Gallium nitride, a powdery yellow compound used in   diodes (LED) radar, antennas and lasers, is grown using   technology, which has in the past been sold to U. S. military equipment maker Northrop Grumman ( ). The Treasury Department, in announcing the order, noted that Aixtron makes equipment for the semiconductor industry, including   Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) systems used to grow crystalline layers for semiconductors, especially those based on gallium nitride. Gallium nitride technology can boost the power and sensitivity of weapons systems while cutting their cost because it needs less electricity. The technology is being used to upgrade the radars of both American and   Patriot missile defense systems. CFIUS never gives reasons for its decisions. But sources have previously told Reuters it blocked the $3. 3 billion sale of Philips' ( ) lighting business, Lumileds, to a consortium of Chinese investors last January over gallium nitride concerns. AIXTRON'S FUTURE Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters at a regular briefing on Friday that the deal was ”normal commercial activity” and that China hoped the world would not interfere politically. The German Economy Ministry withdrew its approval for the deal in October and is now doing its own review of the transaction. It said the German process was independent of the U. S. scrutiny. Analysts have said Aixtron has a bleak future as a   company as it struggles with market overcapacity. Aixtron had 713 employees at the end of the third quarter, 5 percent less than a year ago. A fall in Aixtron's shares took them below Grand Chip Investment's offer price of 6. 00 euros per share. The stock is hovering around a   low. Bigger chipmakers such as Germany's Infineon ( ) and   STMicroelectronics ( ) were also slightly lower, shrugging off fears of an M&A slowdown following two years of consolidation of the global semiconductor industry.

129241,193952,Options Clearing Corp shakes up senior management,Reuters,Tom Polansek,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-occ-management-shakeup-idUSKBN13R2P7?il=0  ," The primary clearinghouse for U. S. options trades named new finance and compliance chiefs on Friday in the latest     aimed at improving oversight. The Options Clearing Corp, known as OCC, also said it had hired a former CME Group Inc ( ) executive to fill a newly created treasurer's position. The changes are part of an overhaul in leadership as OCC works to bolster the way it manages finances and risk after its regulator, the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission, raised concerns in recent years. The Financial Stability Oversight Council in 2012 designated the company as a systemically important Financial Market Utility under the   financial reform. The designation requires compliance with risk management standards and heightened oversight by regulators. OCC's latest hires boost ”the breadth and depth of experience we believe is necessary to strengthen OCC's financial management and risk governance culture,” Chief Executive Officer Craig Donohue said in a statement. Donohue, a former CME chief, became OCC's CEO in September after joining the company as executive chairman in January 2014. In September, OCC also named a new chief risk officer and chief audit executive, and filled the newly created jobs of chief administrative officer and chief commercial officer. OCC had separated the chairman and CEO roles when Donohue joined the company, and a company director said in a news release at the time that the move was ”proof of OCC's ongoing commitment to adopt best practices for corporate governance.” When asked whether OCC's board had changed its feelings on the matter, given Donohue's new position in both roles, OCC spokesman David Prosperi said, ”It's a different board and different time.” Donohue started at OCC following reports in 2013 that the SEC had criticized regulatory compliance, governance and risk management at the company.              OCC is working to ”increase our resiliency by being more proactive to address these issues before they become major challenges,” Prosperi said by telephone. The company has ”already addressed a great majority of the remediation issues that were brought forth” by the SEC in recent years, he said. Chief Financial Officer Kimberly McGarry will leave OCC after two years and be replaced on Monday by Amy Shelly, a former CFO for trading firm Optiver U. S. the company said. Deputy general counsel Joe Adamczyk will become chief compliance officer, replacing Richard Wallace, a   veteran. James Pribel, formerly CME's treasurer, will fill the new position of first vice president of Treasury.  (Reporting by Tom Polansek; Editing by Sandra Maler and Leslie Adler) U.

The settlement must be approved by a federal judge. Sally Welborn, a senior vice president at Bentonville,     said in a statement that diversity and inclusion were among the company's core values. ”We will continue to not distinguish between same and opposite sex spouses when it comes to the benefits we offer under our health insurance plan,” she said.    the largest private U. S. employer, began offering health insurance benefits to   spouses in 2014, a year after the U. S. Supreme Court struck down a provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that denied benefits to married gay couples. Cote, who has worked at   stores in Maine and Massachusetts since 1999, said in the lawsuit that her wife, Diana Smithson, developed cancer in 2012 and  's denial of insurance coverage led to more than $150, 000 in medical debt.

129245,193958,DoubleLine Total Return posts 3rd largest outflow since 2013 in Nov,Reuters,Jennifer Ablan,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-funds-doubleline-outflow-idUSKBN13R2GY?il=0  ," The DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund had net outflows of $1. 4 billion in November, the   cash withdrawals since the ” ” months of 2013, while flows increased into DoubleLine's low duration and unconstrained bond funds, the firm said Friday. The $59. 2 billion DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund, an     bond fund that invests primarily in   securities, is run by Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive officer, and Philip Barach, its president. It is the largest fund in the firm by total assets. The DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund's largest and   net outflows for a month,  $2. 2 billion and  $2. 0 billion, were posted respectively during the   months of December and September 2013.      In May 2013, after a mere suggestion of an imminent reduction or ”taper” of bond purchases by   Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, yields skyrocketed in a span of four months.  Throughout 2016, Gundlach has warned that rising rates would translate into negative returns, which could spark a logical rotation out of   bond funds. ”I predicted this would happen,” Gundlach said about the cash withdrawals.  But unlike during the taper tantrum of the second half of 2013, DoubleLine enters the next   period with multiple strategies and track records of three years or longer  designed for investors fearing still higher rates. Investors have moved money into DoubleLine's low duration, unconstrained bond and equity portfolios. DoubleLine's largest equities portfolio, the $1. 7 billion DoubleLine Shiller Enhanced CAPE fund  had a net inflow of $172 million in November, the largest net monthly inflow since the Oct. 31, 2013 inception of the fund. The fund had a    net inflow of $844 million.  The $360. 2 million DoubleLine Flexible Income Fund  which is an unconstrained bond fund, had a net inflow of $36 million in November, its second largest net monthly inflow since inception and up from a $17. 9 million net inflow in the previous month.

The $3. 4 billion DoubleLine Low Duration Bond Fund ( ) had a net inflow of $154. 4 million in November, its largest net monthly inflow for the year so far and up from $61. 5 million in October.

129246,193959,Trump supporters try to block vote recounts in three states,Reuters,David Ingram and Susan Heavey,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-recount-idUSKBN13R1SV?il=0  ," Supporters of   Trump moved on Friday to halt the Green Party's requests for   recounts of the presidential votes in three states where Trump, a Republican, won with narrow victories. Lawsuits were pending in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, three ”Rust Belt” states which bucked their history of supporting Democrats and gave Trump thin wins in the Nov. 8 election. The Green Party has said its requests for recounts in those states are focused on ensuring the integrity of the U. S. voting system and not on changing the result of the election. Even if the recounts take place, they are extremely unlikely to change the overall outcome of the election, in which Trump beat Democrat Clinton. Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who garnered only about 1 percent of the vote, has said the recount campaign is not targeted at Trump or Clinton. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, a Republican, filed a lawsuit on Friday to halt the requested recount in his state, where Trump won with a margin of roughly 10, 700 votes over Clinton.  Recounting all of the state's votes ”threatens to silence all Michigan votes for president” because of an impending federal deadline to finalize results, Schuette said in a statement.  In Wisconsin, where the recount is already underway, a federal judge on Friday rejected a request for an emergency stay by the   political action committee Great America PAC. U. S. District Judge James Peterson scheduled a hearing for Dec. 9 to consider whether to halt the recount at that time. The lawsuit filed by the PAC cited as legal precedent the U. S. Supreme Court's Bush v. Gore decision that ended the 2000 election and Florida recount. The presidential race is decided by the Electoral College, or a tally of wins from the    contests, rather than by the popular national vote. Federal law requires states to resolve disputes over the appointment of electors by Dec. 13.  Trump surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed to win, with 306 electoral votes, and the recount would have to flip the result to Clinton in all three states to change the overall result. In the popular vote, Clinton had a margin of more than 2. 5 million votes over Trump, the Cook Political Report said. Schuette also criticized Stein for the potential expense of a recount, although Stein said last week that she had raised $3. 5 million to cover some costs. A Schuette spokeswoman said on Friday that Stein had contributed $787, 500, but the recount would cost some $5 million. Stein has scheduled a news conference for Monday at Trump Tower in NY City. ”We won't stand down as Trump and his allies seek to frivolously obstruct the legal processes set up to ensure the accuracy, security and fairness of our elections,” Stein said in a statement on Friday.  Michigan's recount is expected to begin on Wednesday, barring court action, after the state's board of canvassers deadlocked   on Friday on a motion objecting to the recount, the Michigan StateSecretary's Office said. The board of canvassers is required to respond in writing to Schuette's lawsuit by midday on Tuesday. The Trump campaign's own attorneys have also moved to block recount efforts in Pennsylvania and Michigan.  A Pennsylvania court has scheduled a hearing for Monday morning in Harrisburg, the state capital. In an order on Friday, the court told lawyers for both sides to be prepared to talk about whether enough evidence of wrongdoing exists to keep the case going.  According to Stein's website on Friday, the Green Party had raised $6. 8 million so far for the recount and has a goal of $9. 5 million. Lawyers for Clinton have said they would take part in the Wisconsin recount effort to ensure her campaign is legally represented, and that they would do the same if necessary in Michigan and Pennsylvania. Trump won Wisconsin with a margin of roughly 22, 000 votes over Clinton, and in Pennsylvania he won with a margin of about 49, 500 votes.

S. antitrust litigation by traders and other investors who accused the German bank of conspiring to manipulate gold prices at their expense. The preliminary settlement was filed on Friday with the U. S. District Court in Manhattan, and requires a judge's approval. Deutsche Bank denied wrongdoing. The bank in October agreed to pay $38 million to settle similar litigation over alleged silver price manipulation. Amanda Williams, a spokeswoman for the bank, declined to comment. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case is one of many in the Manhattan court in which investors accused banks of conspiring to rig rates and prices in financial and commodities markets. Investors sued Deutsche Bank, Barclays Plc, Bank of Nova Scotia, HSBC Holdings Plc and Societe Generale in 2014, claiming that they conspired to fix gold prices from 2004 to 2013. While the investors did not estimate the size of the banks' gold portfolios, they said the gold derivatives market alone reached $650 billion during the class period. Deutsche Bank had agreed to settle its part of the case in April, but the terms were not disclosed until now. In an Oct. 3 decision, U. S.

S. unemployment rate fell to a   low of 4. 6 percent in November, as employers added another 178, 000 jobs,  making it almost certain that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later this month. The unemployment rate hit its lowest level since August 2007 because more people found work but also because the labor force shrank as more people retired, lowering the number of   people in the labor force to 62. 7 percent.  U. S. nonfarm payrolls increased by 178, 000 jobs last month after increasing by 142, 000 in October, the Labor Department said on Friday. Economists had forecast payrolls rising by 175, 000 last month and the unemployment rate remaining unchanged at 4. 9 percent. ”The decline in the unemployment rate and the unambiguous decrease in labor market slack are likely to place further upward pressure on inflation. This report easily clears the bar for a December rate hike,” said Michael Gapen, chief economist at Barclays in NY. Wages slipped for the first time in nearly a year though after two straight months of increases. Economists partially blamed the drop in average hourly earnings on a calendar quirk, which they expect Fed officials will overlook at their Dec.   policy meeting.  Average hourly earnings fell three cents, or 0. 1 percent, after rising 0. 4 percent in October and gaining 0. 3 percent in September. Average hourly earnings fell for workers in mining, manufacturing and utilities in November.  Last month's drop in wages lowered the    gain to 2. 5 percent in November from October's 2. 8 percent increase, which was the largest rise in nearly    years. ”This is likely to be a temporary setback, as further tightening in labor market conditions should increase competition for skilled labor and support stronger wage growth,” said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. A broad measure of unemployment, that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working   because they cannot find   employment, fell   of a percentage point to 9. 3 percent, the lowest level since April 2008. After a rally of about 6. 0 percent in the past three weeks, U. S. stocks ended little changed in the wake of the jobs data on Friday. U. S. Treasury bond yields on Friday eased from   highs after the worst   in debt markets in nearly eight years following the election of Trump as U. S. president in early November. Trump's plan to increase infrastructure spending and cut taxes could encourage companies to boost hiring and spur an even faster pace of economic growth over the coming years, analysts said.  BROAD GAINS Job gains have slowed from an average of 229, 000 per month in 2015 to an average of 180, 000 this year as the labor market nears full employment. Still, the monthly increases are more than enough to absorb new entrants into the labor market.  Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create just under 100, 000 jobs a month to keep up with growth in the   population. ”It is not that firms aren't trying to hire, they just cannot find qualified workers at the wages they want to pay,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.   The jobs report added to data on consumer spending, the housing market and manufacturing in suggesting the economy continued to gain momentum in the fourth quarter after output rose at its fastest pace in two years in the third quarter. About 226, 000 people dropped out of the labor force last month. As a result, the labor participation rate, or the share of   Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell 0. 1 percentage point to 62. 7 percent.  The participation rate is near   lows, partly reflecting demographic change. Economists believe that the low participation rate is hindering faster wage growth. Job gains last month were broad, though manufacturing shed another 4, 000 jobs. Manufacturing payrolls have now dropped for four straight months. Construction employment increased by 19, 000 jobs last month after rising by 14, 000 in October.  The retail sector shed 8, 300 jobs in November, which could reflect a shift toward online shopping that has forced department stores such as Macy's Inc ( ) to close several stores. Retail jobs have declined for two straight months. Professional and business services payrolls increased by 63, 000 last month. Healthcare and social assistance employment increased by 34, 700.   jobs, a harbinger for future hiring, rose by 14, 300.  Government employment gained 22, 000 jobs.

S.   body said it would investigate New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc ( ) in the wake of a Reuters report that detailed allegations of academic fraud at the company. The American International Recruitment Council, which certifies agencies that recruit foreign students on behalf of U. S. colleges, will investigate the company in response to the report, said Jeet Joshee, AIRC's  .  “It's concerning, highly concerning,” he said of the allegations in the report. The article can be read here:  Shares of New Oriental plunged after Reuters reported the council's plan to open a probe. The drop in the stock, as much as 24 percent at one point on Friday afternoon, erased more than $1. 8 billion from the company's stock market value at its lowest point. It closed the day down 14 percent at $42. 00. AIRC is a   membership organization comprised of 289 colleges and universities and 78 agencies that refer foreign students to U. S. schools often for a commission. It establishes best practices for international student recruitment and certifies agencies in a process that includes inspections. Joshee said AIRC certified New Oriental's counseling division   —   Beijing New Oriental Vision Overseas Consultancy Co    about three or four years ago. He said AIRC could revoke the certification if the fraud accusations are confirmed. Reuters reported today that eight former and current New Oriental employees had told the news agency that the   company had helped to write college application essays and teacher recommendations, and had falsified a high school transcript.  A New Oriental student contract reviewed by Reuters stated that its services included “writing or polishing” parts of applications. The contract also said New Oriental would set up an email account on behalf of the client for communicating with colleges, keeping sole control of the password. Several former employees said some students never even saw their applications. “It's most concerning that they would actually handle the whole application for a student,” said Joshee, who chairs AIRC's certification body. Joshee also serves as associate vice president for international education at California State University, Long Beach. New Oriental denies condoning or wittingly engaging in application fraud. The publicly listed company, with annual revenue of $1. 5 billion, is China's largest provider of private education services. In addition to offering college counseling services to thousands of Chinese students seeking to study in the USA, New Oriental has contracts with colleges including Arizona State University, the University of Cincinnati and Temple University. Those colleges pay New Oriental commissions when it refers students who enroll. Two New Oriental employees at AIRC's annual convention in Miami told Reuters the company had “relationships” with about 100 U. S. colleges and universities. They declined to say how many of those schools pay commissions to New Oriental. Joshee said his school   California State, Long Beach    signed a contract this year with New Oriental, although it has not provided any students to date. He said the university normally pays agents $1, 500 to $2, 000 for each student who enrolls. The university would await the results of AIRC's probe before taking any action, he said.

Deutsche Bank will immediately cease debt sales services to some financial institutions and hedge funds as well as equity sales activities, the execution of equities trading orders and  equity structuring activities for some clients, a spokesman said, citing an internal memo. Germany's biggest bank is looking to shed clients that cost more to service than they bring in in returns as part of efforts to turn around its business and boost its capital. Deutsche Bank Chief Executive John Cryan is stepping up the restructuring process as the bank finalises talks with U. S. justice authorities over a   dollar fine related to U. S. mortgages. In October 2015, Cryan had said at a strategy presentation that Deutsche Bank would reduce the number of clients in its Global Markets and Corporate & Investment Banking divisions by about 50 percent. ”We expect to   about half of the current list of clients as the economic returns in these relationships are inadequate to us,” he said at the time. He also said that 80 percent of the investment bank's income came from 30 percent of clients.

129256,193973,I could have won more if I'd got serious: Bolt,Reuters,Mitch Phillips,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-athletics-iaaf-awards-bolt-idUSKBN13R25M  ," Looking back at his astonishing career on the night he was named Athlete of the Year for the sixth time, Usain Bolt said his only real regret was not taking his sport more seriously at an earlier age. ”Maybe I would have been at four Olympics,” the superstar Jamaican sprinter told reporters on Friday before being crowned  IAAF male Athlete of the Year again on the back of his amazing Rio Games sprint   in August. ”The award is definitely a big deal, it proves all the hard work has paid off,” he said after Olympic 10, 000 meters champion and world record holder Almaz Ayana of Ethiopia took the women's equivalent. ”The fans helped vote for this and it's for the fans I keep doing it.” With nine Olympic golds in the drawer, Bolt plans to hang up his spikes next year after a farewell tour of his favorite venues. He will run the 100 meters only before competing at the world championships in London where he will be gunning for his 12th and 13th world titles if he goes in the relay.  ”When I look back the only real thing I think I would change was to have got more serious more quickly,” said Bolt. ”I was relying more on my talent. If I'd got more serious I think I would have done a lot more in my career. It's shocking but it's true. Maybe if I'd started younger I'd have had four Olympics.” Despite his multiple titles and world records, Bolt said the race that would always have a particular place in his heart was the world junior championships in his home country when he won the 200 as a   . ”That was special,” he said. ”That was the beginning. Jamaica 2002, where it all began. That was the biggest step.” However, it was a defeat five years later that made the biggest impact. Bolt took the 200 silver behind American Tyson Gay at the 2007 Osaka world championships and it was a real   call. ”After I lost I remember going to my coach saying, 'I really tried my best but what can I do to win because I really need to win? ',” Bolt explained. ”He said: 'You're slacking off in the gym. If you want to win you have to get stronger.' So I was like ‘alright'. I knew what I needed to do and from then I took the step and just worked and worked.” SPECTACULAR STYLE Within nine months Bolt was the 100 world record holder and weeks later blasted himself into worldwide consciousness by winning the 100 and 200 and 4x100 relay at the Beijing Olympics in spectacular style. Having found a way to win he was in no mood to stop, repeating the feat at London 2012 and, despite early season injuries, doing it again in Rio. Now 30 and with his speediest days behind him, Bolt is trimming his workrate to enjoy one last season, running a series of 100 races only. ”Next year is mainly for the fans,” said Bolt who always gives up a huge amount of time to sign autographs and pose for photos every time he races. ”It's a last opportunity for some people to see me run and a chance for me to say goodbye. I'd like to go back to some of my favorite places to run, Ostrava, Lausanne, maybe Paris.” And then that will be it. The man who has carried his troubled sport, sometimes   for a decade will step aside for the next generation. There will be no Michael   comeback at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics either. ”Oh no,” he said. ”My coach said, 'Do not retire and come back, don't ever do that'. ”It's a bit different for swimming but for most track and field athletes it never goes well. ”I'm still talking to people about what I will do afterwards and I definitely want to stay involved in the sport but at the moment I am just looking forward to doing nothing,” said Bolt.

129257,193974,Trump's dilemma: slower job growth or rising rates and inflation?,Reuters,Howard Schneider,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-jobs-idUSKBN13R2A2  ," A drop in the U. S. unemployment rate last month to a   low signals the risk of a collision between   Trump's plans to goose the economy and the Federal Reserve's efforts to tap the brakes with higher interest rates. Since Trump's election, officials at the U. S. central bank have cautiously introduced the possibility that his spending and tax cut plans could prompt a faster pace of rate increases than the two hikes currently foreseen in 2017. An increase is already expected when the Fed meets in two weeks. Fresh economic projections, the first since the election, will also be issued and Fed Chair Janet Yellen will hold a news conference when the meeting concludes on Dec. 14. With November's decline, the jobless rate is now already below the most optimistic projections from Fed policymakers for where it would stand at year end. If it keeps moving lower, Trump's spending and tax cut plans may be adding fuel to a tank that's already brimming. Possible new trade or immigration restrictions could make markets even tighter, and switch the Fed from worrying about the risk of deflation to fighting price rises before they get out of hand. ”There is much more than the Trump election driving the . .. rally that started the day after the election,” Bank of the West chief economist Scott Anderson wrote. ”We are seeing signs of a synchronized rebound in the global economy.” When Fed policymakers issued their last projections in September, the lowest level predicted for the unemployment rate at the end of the year was 4. 7 percent. In November, it fell   of a percentage point to 4. 6 percent. The decline was partly due to a drop in the labor force participation rate, which officials have expected to begin falling again because of an aging population with more retirees. In general, the lower the unemployment rate, the slower the pace of job growth the economy can sustain without pushing up wages and prices too quickly. Policymakers insist they still have time to move rates higher to keep price increases under control. Several officials feel it may even help fix some of the damage from the   recession if inflation moved above the Fed's 2 percent target for a while. That might, for example, allow steady wage increases to restore some of the ground lost by workers. However, in recent months even ostensibly dovish officials, like Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, have cautioned that steady rate hikes might be needed to avoid the need for even faster increases that could trigger a recession.  ”I view a small step up in interest rates as appropriate, not because I want to curtail the expansion, but because I believe it will help prolong the expansion,” Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester said on Wednesday.. Trump's victory gives that debate more urgency. His plans for a big infrastructure spending package, tax cuts and tighter controls on immigration could test the limits of what the economy can absorb before overheating.   For a year now, Fed officials have said they expect job growth to slow as the economy nears full employment. It hasn't happened, meaning Trump will take office at what may be a tough point of inflection: either job creation slows or inflation jumps. Jed Kolko, chief economist at the Indeed job site, said the current pace of job growth and low unemployment rate ”sets a baseline for the Trump administration.” ”Recent wage gains and unemployment declines make this a tough economy to improve on,” he said.

129258,193977,Oil rallies to best week in years after OPEC output deal,Reuters,Devika  Krishna Kumar,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-idUSKBN13R02L  ," Oil prices rallied for their best week in at least five years on Friday, steadying above $51 a barrel, following OPEC's decision to cut crude output to rein in a global glut that has weighed on prices for more than two years. After the deal was announced on Wednesday, the market focused on the implementation and impact of OPEC's first output cuts since 2008, to be joined by Russia and possibly other   producers. Crude prices were pressured by data showing oil output in Russia rose in November to a   high and Moscow's plan to use its record November oil production as its baseline when it cuts output. With cuts being implemented next year only against   levels, analysts said there was still a possibility that oversupply, which has halved oil prices since 2014, remains a factor next year. ”Global, and especially U. S. crude oil inventories are currently at extremely high levels after two years of massive oversupply,” Societe Generale analysts said. ”While the OPEC agreement is very significant and will result in some moderate global stockdraws next year, it is likely to take more than one year for crude inventory levels to return to more normal levels.”   Brent crude futures LCOc1 ended the session up at $54. 46 a barrel, up 52 cents, 0. 96 percent. The contract rose more than 15 percent for the week, its biggest gain since early 2009. U. S. crude CLc1 settled at $51. 68 per barrel, up 62 cents or 1. 21 percent and notched its biggest weekly gain since early 2011, with a rise of 12 percent.   Oil drew support from a weak dollar, which slipped against a basket of currencies . DXY. Still, traders said   ahead of the weekend limited crude's price gains. ”The petroleum markets have settled into quieter mixed flows as the waves created by Wednesday's OPEC announcement gradually dissipate, with some light profit taking emerging in crude oil,” said Tim Evans, energy futures specialist at Citigroup. ”A weaker U. S. dollar is typically supportive for commodity prices and may have helped steady crude oil from the lows in today's trade.” Prices rose to session highs after the White House said it expects U. S. Obama to sign U. S. legislation extending sanctions against Iran for 10 years into law.  Iran is also seen as a wild card in the execution of the OPEC deal.  U. S.   Trump's transition team is examining proposals for new   sanctions on Iran, the Financial Times reported on Friday.  Iran had threatened on Friday to retaliate against the U. S. Senate's vote to extend the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) for 10 years, saying it violated last year's deal with six major powers that curbed its nuclear program.  The sanctions were first adopted in 1996 to punish investments in Iran's energy industry and deter its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, U. S. energy companies extended their recovery in oil drilling into a seventh month this week, data from energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc BHI. N showed on Friday.

129260,193980,"On final trip, Carter looks to reassure Asia allies",Reuters,Idrees Ali,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-asia-military-idUSKBN13R2HY  ," U. S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter makes his last scheduled trip to Asia next week, and he will try to sooth anxieties caused by Trump's election, U. S. officials said. The Obama administration made Asia and U. S. alliances there a priority. While details of Trump's approach to the region remain scant, his calls for allies to pay more to sustain U. S. forces or face their possible withdrawal have alarmed Japan and South Korea.  In Tokyo, Carter will emphasize the importance of the U. S.  alliance and the presence of some 50, 000 U. S. troops there, given China's rise and the increasing threat from   North Korea, a U. S. defense official said. But the soothing effect of anything Carter has to say will be limited because he is a ” ” and does not represent Trump's   policies. A source who has advised the incoming president's transition team downplayed concerns about a dramatic break with the past or  possibly allowing Japan and South Korea to develop nuclear weapons rather than relying on the U. S. nuclear umbrella. Trump wants the allies to shoulder a greater share of defense costs, but this would be a matter for negotiation, the source said. ”It's not an ultimatum; it's not saying 'Let's crush the alliance,'” he said. ”It will be a negotiation like we always have,” the source said. Trump caused alarm during his campaign by suggesting that Japan and South Korea could acquire nuclear weapons to defend themselves, although he has not repeated those remarks since his election.  ”As   there has never been any question other than supporting the existing (nuclear) umbrella and the existing   regime,” he said. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was the first foreign leader to meet Trump after the election, and said afterwards that alliances must be based on trust and that he saw the future president as a ”trustworthy leader.” However, Trump plans to quit the   trade pact that was the economic pillar of Obama's ”pivot” to Asia, which had Japan as its main partner.  ”Regardless of what (Carter) conveys, the reverberations caused by Trump's election have made many countries envisage a future where a robust U. S. presence may not be a certainty,” said Reed Foster, a defense analyst for IHS Jane's. Carter will also visit India. Trump pledged in his campaign that the USA and India would be ”best friends” and would boost   against Islamist militants. In August, the two countries reached a deal on using each other's military bases for repairs, and they have been cooperating on an Indian aircraft carrier project. A senior U. S. defense official said two pacts that would allow secure communications and the exchange of nautical and other data would not be sealed before Obama leaves office.

129261,193981,Russia not serious in talks with Syrian rebels: opposition official,Reuters,Angus McDowall  and Tom Perry,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-idUSKBN13R22E  ," A senior Syrian opposition official accused Russia on Friday of procrastinating in talks with rebels over Aleppo, signaling no progress in diplomacy which rebels hoped would ease dire conditions in the city where they are in danger of defeat. Buoyed by its rapid capture of several whole neighborhoods, the government on Friday took journalists on an escorted tour of the ruined northeast Aleppo districts which fell on Sunday and Monday, and which the army is sweeping for mines.  The rebels' talks with Russia, the most powerful ally of President Bashar   in Ankara point to the bad set of options they face. The government assault aims to take Aleppo by the time U. S.   Trump takes office.  ”There is severe procrastination by the Russians,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the secret nature of the talks. ”There is absolutely no seriousness,” he added. However, analysts have said rebels may have to agree to withdraw, depending on the terms.     Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, speaking at a news conference in Rome, acknowledged contacts with the Syrian opposition and added that ”a military solution to the Syria conflict does not exist”.  The talks have been going for about two weeks and are the first between Russia and rebel groups who say they have been abandoned by the West.  Moscow's warplanes have played a critical role in helping to turn around Assad's fortunes from summer 2015, supporting the offensive against Aleppo by the Syrian army and its allies   Iran's Revolutionary Guards and Shi'ite militias from Lebanon and Iraq.  Some rebel groups are supported by the USA, Turkey and Gulf monarchies, but Syria's insurgents also include jihadist militants such as the former al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat Fateh   previously known as the Nusra Front. The front lines around the   sector of Aleppo have mostly held steady since Monday, when insurgents were forced from more than a third of the area they have controlled for several years in an assault by the Syrian army and its allies.      However, one Syria expert said that although the smaller area they occupied should make defending it easier for rebels, the cumulative impact of intense bombardment could force them to make a deal to withdraw, depending on the terms offered.  ”The opposition's ability to defend itself under this offensive is very much in question, and it's easy to imagine that an eventual withdrawal seems increasingly likely,” said Noah Bonsey of the International Crisis Group.  ARMY ADVANCES The army's advances have allowed it to reopen the northern section of the city's ring road, state TV reported, a move that may improve its transit and communications options near the new front line on another stretch of that highway near the airport.  A Syrian army officer escorting journalists on a tour of Aleppo's recaptured northeast said the army had to evict militants from all parts of the city. ”This will happen soon,” the officer told Reuters TV during the tour.  He said militants who had already given up their arms  would benefit from an amnesty, but those who continued to fight ”will have another fate”.  Recently captured districts of Aleppo bore the marks of the recent fighting. Buildings in several districts had partly collapsed or been damaged by the bombardment.   cars and buses had been used as a barricade. Soldiers in dark green and brown camouflage uniforms carried their weapons as they walked, or rode on the back of trucks through the area. In one place, a vehicle loaded with missiles stood by the roadside. In the south of their sector, rebels retook some positions from the army and its allies in the Sheikh Saeed district where fighting in past days has been concentrated, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a   war monitor, said.  The rebels now control about 70 percent of Sheikh Saeed, located at the southern tip of the   area, the Observatory added. A Syrian military source had said on Wednesday that the army had fully recaptured Sheikh Saeed.    Rebel shelling of   areas in western Aleppo also killed several people on Friday, state television reported.    Aleppo has endured the fiercest fighting in Syria for months as Assad and the rebels trying to oust him struggle for control of a city that was the country's most populous before the war. Its fate is seen on both sides as pivotal to the wider course of the conflict.      FIGHTING The fighting has added to a humanitarian crisis in Aleppo, where the   eastern districts have been besieged since the summer under heavy bombardment, with hundreds dying from air strikes and shortages of food, medicine and fuel.  The United Nations said on Thursday it was very worried about the lack of adequate shelter for the tens of thousands displaced within the city by fighting as winter draws on.  Save the Children, an international charity, said some children had died after becoming separated from their parents in the chaos of the flight from front lines and then killed as they ventured into the open under bombardment or air strikes.  Turkey, a main supporter of the rebellion against Assad, on Friday accused him of being responsible for the deaths of 600, 000 people in the conflict, which has raged since 2011, and called for an immediate cessation of hostilities.

129262,193982,"Europe must brace for new, varied IS attacks: security chief",Reuters,Alastair Macdonald,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-security-idUSKBN13R29K  ," ISIS will attack Europe again, security chiefs warned on Friday, and may add car bombs, cyber and chemical warfare to its local arsenal as European militants drift home after reverses in Syria and Iraq. Gilles de Kerchove, the EU's   Coordinator, said it was impossible to know for sure how many militants were already in Europe plotting. A report on Friday by the EU's Europol policy agency referred to dozens.  Some 2, 500 Europeans may still be fighting in the Middle East, de Kerchove estimated in an interview with Reuters. But as they face setbacks in Mosul, Aleppo and elsewhere, Europe must track them if it is to contain a diaspora of trained militants like that which followed the 1989 Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. ”We have to be prepared because some of them will come to Europe,” said de Kerchove, a veteran EU official whose Brussels office is packed with books and souvenirs from nine years of intensive travel and talking with Europe's troubled neighbors. ”They may try to come back home and we don't want to repeat the mistake we made in the late 80s when the Russians left Afghanistan and we left these mujahideen . .. in the wild.” Many of those fought in Algeria's bloody 1990s and went on to operate in conflicts from Chechnya and Kosovo to Yemen. Some Europeans, among them also wives and children of fighters, may choose to stay in the Middle East even if IS loses its territorial grip. Others may go further afield, with lawless Libya already looking like a new base for European militants and the movement likely to go on recruiting over the Internet. ”The physical caliphate . .. is collapsing but we still have the virtual caliphate and this allows the organization to direct attacks,” de Kerchove said. In his post since 2007, the Belgian lawyer said the past two years have seen an ”impressive” leap forward in intelligence cooperation among EU states and a tightening of law and practice on Europe's borders in response to the variety of IS attacks that have included mass killings in Paris, Brussels and Nice. ”We have nearly fixed most of the loopholes,” he said of what Europe could do internally to combat the Islamist militants who pose by far the bulk of violent threats.  NEW THREATS The tougher part is now, de Kerchove said, to address root grievances for militants, whether among alienated people at home or angry Sunni Muslims in Iraq and Syria. ”The way the fight is developing in Aleppo will have an impact,” he said. ”The way we will try to address the grievances of the Sunni population both in Iraq and in Syria will have an impact.” Inside Europe, he said, ”we are doing a lot better”.     Europol identified immediate threats as similar to recent attacks: groups using automatic rifles and suicide vests packed with   TATP explosive, or loners with knives or trucks. IS was also infiltrating Syrian refugee communities in Europe in a bid to inflame hostility to immigrants in places like Germany. De Kerchove stressed also a new risk of IS bringing car bomb tactics, common in Syria and Iraq, into Europe. Agencies were, he said, also preparing to counter more complex tactics in years to come, such as cyber attacks and biological weapons. For now, he said, the Internet was a weapon mainly of recruitment and radicalization of individuals    something the EU was working on countering in alliance with network companies.  ”So far the terrorist organizations have not used the Internet as a weapon, to mount an attack through the Internet,” he said, citing the risk of disrupting nuclear power stations, dams, electricity grids or even air traffic control systems. ”It has not happened so far . .. but I don't exclude that before five years we will be confronted by this,” de Kerchove said, noting IS had the funds to hire seasoned criminal hackers. The EU was, he said, ”actively working” to counter chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats but did not see an ”acute risk” despite evidence of militants dabbling with germs or using poison gas in Syria. ”We need to be prepared,” he said. International cooperation is a priority and de Kerchove spends much of his time building relationships with Arab countries, Turkey and other neighbors.  Ties with the USA had become very close under Obama and de Kerchove voiced a hope they would remain so under Trump. Working with Britain, a leader in   in Europe, should not be greatly affected by its decision this year to leave the EU. Noting Britain's decision to opt in to closer ties with Europol, he said: ”Intelligence sharing is developing outside the EU framework so . .. Brexit will not have any impact.”  (Editing by Mark Trevelyan) QAMISHLI,   The head of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia said on Wednesday that Turkish military deployments near   areas of northwestern Syria amounted to a ”declaration of war” which could trigger clashes within days.

129263,193984,U.S. regulator clears way for online lenders to have national charter,Reuters,Patrick Rucker and Anna Irrera,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-fintech-idUSKBN13R1TQ  ," Online credit companies and paperless lenders would be able to get federal charters to do business nationwide under a plan outlined on Friday by a U. S. banking regulator. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) the main regulator for federal banks, said it hoped offering a charter for ”fintech” companies would spur banking sector innovation.  ”  products and services are the future of banking and the economy,” OCC director Thomas Curry said, outlining the proposal in a speech at the Georgetown University Law Center. The move might change the regulatory landscape for online lenders such as On Deck, Kabbage Inc and Quicken Loans that now operate under a variety of state licenses. The OCC will allow fintech companies to operate nationally through a   charter. Curry said his agency is open to discussing specific terms of what a charter would entail. Because they do not accept customer deposits, fintech companies are not subject to many federal banking laws.  On Friday, Curry said the   charters for fintech companies would help those lenders reach underserved communities and uphold consumer protections. Ken Rees, chief executive of subprime online lender Elevate, said his firm supported the OCC's efforts. ”Given that so much fintech innovation has gone to help give credit to people who already have it, it's important that the needs of the truly underserved are taken into account,” he said.  Curry said companies obtaining a fintech charter would be ”examined regularly and held to the high standards the OCC has established for all federally chartered institutions.”  He said worldwide investment in the fintech industry has grown in the past five years from $1. 8 billion to $24 billion. Online lenders and other fintech companies have encroached on traditional banking services in recent years with lower overhead and less paperwork. Banks and other established institutions have complained that lack of federal oversight gave online lenders undue competitive advantages. The American Bankers Association welcomed the OCC's pledge to hold fintech companies to high standards. “Maintaining high standards is the best way to ensure customers have access to the best financial products and services,” said Rob Nichols, the trade group's president and chief executive. The Independent Community Bankers of America said fintech regulations ”should be no less stringent than that which applies to insured depository institutions”. NY State Department of Financial Services Superintendent Maria T. Vullo said in a statement her agency opposed ”any effort to federalize what states have been doing  —   and doing well  —   for over a century.” Vullo said any federal fintech regulatory framework would ”be irresponsible if it were to ignore the states' historical role and longstanding expertise in this arena”.    Regulators around the world have ramped up initiatives aimed at better understanding and supporting innovation in the nascent industry. Britain's Financial Conduct Authority is widely seen as among the most active financial watchdogs, launching a special unit more than two years ago to assist young companies in the fintech sector.  “Federal fintech charters would bring the USA in line with other progressive fintech countries like Australia, the U.

129265,193988,Trump creates business advisory council stacked with CEOs,Reuters,Ginger Gibson and Roberta Rampton,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-ceos-idUSKBN13R2D4  ,"   Trump announced the formation of a council to advise him on job creation, a group comprised of the leaders of a variety of major U. S. corporations including GE, GM, Boeing, Disney and IBM.  Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive officer of major investment firm Blackstone Group LP, will chair the council.  “My administration is committed to drawing on private sector expertise and cutting the government red tape that is holding back our businesses from hiring, innovating, and expanding right here in America,” Trump said in a statement announcing the formation of the council.  Trump called Schwarzman earlier this week to ask for his help in chairing the council, according to a source familiar with the discussions who was not authorized to speak publicly on the arrangements. The two men, who are not friends and have not done business together before, drafted a list of CEOs to ask to participate in the forum, and then Schwarzman asked each individual to participate. The forum could meet as frequently as monthly, the source said.  Trump has said that his top priorities will include cutting regulations that affect business and lowering the corporate tax rate, positions business leaders have cheered.  Presidents often convene councils of business leaders. Obama frequently met with the CEOs of large companies and often spoke before the Business Roundtable, comprised of CEOs of big corporations. In 2011, Obama convened a jobs council that was led by General Electric Co CEO Jeff Immelt and an export council headed by Xerox Corp CEO Ursula Burns.     Obama and business leaders worked on trade, technology and immigration efforts. Some members of Trump's council also served in advisory roles with Obama, including Bob Iger, the CEO of Walt Disney Co; Jim McNerney, former CEO of Boeing Co ; and Ginni Rometty, CEO of International Business Machines Corp. All three served on Obama's export council and will continuing advising the next administration. Noticeably absent from the council are heads of leading U. S. technology companies such as Google's parent Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Facebook Inc. Trump's transition team has been slow to establish a group to address cyber security and other technology issues. The council could still add leaders from technology companies, a source familiar with the formation of the group said. The members of Trump's council include:  (Additional reporting by Gui Qing Koh and Gregory Roumeliotis; Editing by David Gregorio and Jonathan Oatis) MEXICO CITY A meeting between Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and U.

129266,193990,Exclusive: Trump financier Ladder Capital explores sale - sources,Reuters,Carl O'Donnell,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-laddercapital-m-a-exclusive-idUSKBN13R276  ,"The move comes as Ladder grapples with new regulations making selling on mortgages more difficult. Founded in 2008, it has been one of the key lenders that Trump has turned to after his relations with major Wall Street banks soured following some of his business bankruptcies in the 1990s.  Ladder is working with investment bank Citigroup Inc ( ) on a sale process, sources said, cautioning there is no certainty of a deal. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Ladder did not immediately respond to requests for comment and Citigroup declined to comment. Ladder shares jumped up 6. 1 percent at $15. 13 in afternoon trading on the news, giving the company a market capitalization of around $1. 7 billion. New   Ladder had about $6. 2 billion of assets on its balance sheet as of September, $2. 4 billion of which were commercial real estate loans and $2. 7 billion of which were commercial real   securities.  It has helped finance many of Trump's famous Manhattan properties, including Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue and the Trump Building on Wall Street.  Starting this month, lenders such as Ladder that repackage and sell their loans as   securities are required to keep a portion of them on their books. Many of them are scrambling to meet these new capital requirements. Ladder is seen well positioned to handle a potential interest rate rise because it has $1. 4 billion of   securities and $1. 2 billion of interest rate hedges on its balance sheet, according to a note by independent real estate investment trust analyst Brad Thomas.    real estate investment trusts have mushroomed since the 2008 financial crisis, as stricter regulations on traditional financial institutions opened up opportunities for new types of lenders to enter the market. Ladder Capital went public in 2014, and converted to a real estate investment trust in 2015.

129267,193991,Actelion's silence has hedge funds betting big on J&J deal,Reuters,Maiya Keidan and John Miller,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-actelion-m-a-hedgefunds-idUSKBN13R22F  ," Actelion's silence speaks volumes to the dozens of   hedge funds piling into the Swiss biotech firm, betting that Johnson & Johnson's (J&J) ( ) approach will result in an outright takeover and handsome returns.  A source familiar with the matter has told Reuters the two companies are discussing a bid of close to $27 billion, or 250 Swiss francs ($248) per share, which is 25 percent above Actelion's current share price.  Both companies have confirmed that U. S. diversified healthcare group J&J   maker of Pizbuin sun screen, surgical tools and arthritis drug Remicade   has approached Actelion about a potential takeover, but kept mum on details.    and Chief Executive   Clozel and fellow shareholder Rudolf Maag have in the past been outspoken defenders of an independent Actelion, which has built a $2 billion business by focusing on a debilitating lung disease.  But they have made no public comment since the companies confirmed the talks a week ago, and Clozel would have some explaining to do if he rejected an offer with such a big premium, fund managers with a more conventional investment approach told Reuters. ”This time it's different. It has not been outright rejected. That's an indication that you can go a little bit bigger,” said Michael Wegener, managing partner at Hong     hedge fund Case Equity Partners. He has staked 1 percent of his fund's net assets under management on Actelion, but did not disclose the size of his assets, and is prepared to stock up if J&J tables a more detailed takeover proposal. ”We don't think Clozel is going to fight,” said another hedge fund manager, who asked not to be named.  Clozel holds about 5 percent in the biotech firm, according to its annual report, while his wife Martine Clozel,   and chief scientific officer, also owns an undisclosed stake. No detailed data is available on share purchases by   funds   who typically go after deal targets available for a discount to a mooted takeover offer   but Reuters journalists have been in contact with scores of fund managers who have discussed their tactics. Daily turnover in Actelion shares has on average jumped more than fourfold since media reports of a J&J approach emerged on Nov. 24, from their   average.  The shares were trading at 200 francs as of 1603 GMT on Friday, up 27 percent since Nov. 24.    OFFER Many investors are counting on J&J to structure a deal that would grant shareholders a cash payout and award Clozel a   departure that honors the value of the firm's development pipeline of experimental drugs.  Some analysts argue J&J, or any rival suitor, will pay up for Actelion's launched products   two new drugs alone are seen generating combined peak sales of well above $4 billion   but have little appreciation for its drug development projects.  Analysts at brokerage Brian Garnier on Friday suggested Clozel could be offered to keep control of the experimental drugs portfolio and cash in on the rest.   ”A   Actelion going forward would therefore consist of a pipeline company with limited or no revenues.”  Rudolf Maag, another linchpin investor, who according to Thomson Reuters data holds 5. 1 percent, has previous ties to J&J: he made much of his near $2 billion fortune when he sold his stake in medical device maker   to J&J four years ago. Maag declined to comment this week, a departure from five years ago when he and Clozel defended Actelion against an attempt by U. S.  hedge fund Elliott Advisors to get the biotech firm to put itself up for auction. Hedge funds see Maag playing a critical role in a J&J deal, potentially persuading Clozel the offer is too good for shareholders to pass up. ”We are monitoring the situation very actively,” said one hedge fund manager, speaking on condition of anonymity.  ”I would strongly assume pretty much every other   fund in the world is doing the same. I have heard of   funds who already have several $100 million worth of stock.”  (Additional reporting by Paul Arnold; Writing by Ludwig Burger; Editing by Susan Fenton) Biopharmaceutical company Celgene Corp will buy a stake in BeiGene Ltd and help develop and commercialize BeiGene's investigational treatment for tumor cancers, the companies said on Wednesday.

143533,214874,"Allegiant Air, with ultra-low fares, draws FAA's attention over safety concerns",Washington Post,Steven Mufson,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160902000145/https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/allegiant-air-with-ultra-low-fares-draws-faas-attention-over-safety-concerns/2016/09/01/08c0f202-28f5-11e6-ae4a-3cdd5fe74204_story.html
","      Just over a year ago, Allegiant Air pilot Jason Kinzer was sitting in the cockpit of a    McDonnell Douglas   aircraft bound for Hagerstown, Md. having just taken off from St. Petersburg, Fla. As the plane climbed through 2, 500 feet, a cabin attendant alerted Kinzer to a strong burning smell. Alarmed, Kinzer turned Allegiant Air Flight 864 back toward the airport. Fire and rescue crews met the plane on the runway as smoke wafted from an engine. Kinzer told the 144 passengers to disembark. He then helped a flight attendant carry a paraplegic passenger to the exit. It seemed to be model behavior. But Allegiant Air did not praise Kinzer. It fired him. In a dismissal letter, the airline called the evacuation of the plane “unwarranted” and faulted Kinzer as not “striving to preserve the Company's assets, aircraft, ground equipment, fuel and the personal time of our employees and customers. ” Later, the company's attorneys would call Kinzer's account an “inaccurate and   recitation of events. ” Kinzer's saga, now the subject of a court case in Nevada, involves one of dozens of incidents that have prompted scrutiny of the safety and maintenance practices at Allegiant Air, a   carrier that has found a profitable niche in serving airports in    cities.   In an industry that has habitually struggled to make money, Allegiant's soaring earnings stand out. Last year, its profits jumped 154 percent, to $220. 4 million, as the carrier  —   relying heavily on cheaper, previously used planes  —   flew more than 300 routes. In June, Allegiant announced a dozen new routes and three new cities, for the first time competing with major carriers at airports in Newark and Denver.  [Flights are about to become cheaper]  But observers with various interests and viewpoints are asking whether Allegiant has pursued fast growth and financial success at the expense of other considerations. Unwanted attention has come from federal regulators worried about safety, investors betting against the stock, a pilots union concerned about maintenance, and corporate governance experts who fault the airline's cozy board of directors as not doing more to head off problems. About 300 pages of Federal Aviation Administration records for Allegiant show a pattern of safety problems that triggered a relatively large number of aborted takeoffs, emergency descents and emergency landings from Jan. 1, 2015, through this March. The Allegiant records were obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Robert MacArthur, owner of Alternative Research Services, a consultancy that caters to short sellers  —   investors who benefit when company share prices drop. Allegiant had about nine times as many serious incidents over that period as Delta Air Lines had with similar types of planes of similar vintage  —   even though Delta was flying about three times as many such planes, according to a Washington Post analysis of FAA documents relating to both companies. “I don't think there's a safety problem,” Allegiant's chief operating officer, Jude Bricker, said in an interview. “Our unscheduled landings in particular are a result primarily of an abundance of caution, and our pilots are entitled to put their planes into landing anytime they feel unsafe. ” But leading experts said Allegiant needs to pay closer attention to its aging aircraft. “They just have a lot of problems with leaks, doors not closing properly, things not working properly,” said Mary F. Schiavo, an aviation lawyer who served as inspector general for the Department of Transportation from 1990 to 1996. “They have electrical smells every day, which means they've got old wiring. It's just kind of a poorly maintained fleet. ” Allegiant said that its “safety protocols emphasize putting the safety of passengers foremost. ” And in July, the company said it had agreed to depart from customary practice and buy 12 new Airbus A320s for delivery by 2018.    The fortunes of chief executive Maurice J. Gallagher Jr. are tied to Allegiant Air's performance. Higher maintenance spending could cut into profits  —   and hurt the company's stock price. Gallagher, who does not take a base salary, owns about 20 percent of the company and received more than $4 million in dividends last year. On March 9, he sold shares of Allegiant worth $47. 8 million. (Andrew   News)  A swift ascent The chief executive of Allegiant Air is Maurice “Maury” J. Gallagher Jr. who ran ValuJet until one of its planes plunged into the Florida Everglades in 1996, killing all 110 people aboard. In 1999, after ValuJet was merged into AirTran, Gallagher started building a new carrier, Allegiant Air, which now has about 80 planes serving about 113 airports. The Las   company became the darling of Wall Street. It was the subject of a glowing article in Fast Company. It made Fortune's list of   companies. Aviation Week in 2013 named it the   small carrier in the world. Although the stock has lost nearly half its value since its peak of $234 a share last year, it has increased more than fivefold in the past decade. Analysts hailed Gallagher's strategy of buying older   often for a tenth of the $40 million to $50 million its competitors were paying for new aircraft. The average age of Allegiant's   fleet is 26. 49 years; recently added Airbus planes also are used, with an average age of 14. 2 years. But Allegiant Air has run into trouble. Allegiant aircraft this year made unscheduled landings on Feb. 28; on March 2, 3 and 14; and twice on March 13, according to FAA documents. On March 5, a crew aborted a takeoff after a loud bang, warning signs from the right engine and smoke in the cabin. One flight attendant was treated by emergency medical technicians for smoke inhalation. All airlines must file reports about safety and maintenance incidents with the FAA. After Allegiant's spate of midair incidents, the agency moved up a periodic evaluation of the airline that had been scheduled for 2018. “The purpose of these reviews is to verify a company is complying with the applicable regulations; determine whether it is operating at the highest possible degree of safety; and identify and address any   issues,” the FAA said, although it would not comment on Allegiant. Later, in a July 18 letter to Allegiant, the FAA said it had “identified several element design and element performance deficiencies”  —   such as software that did not meet FAA specifications and a failure to notice fractures in a   pylon  —   and ordered the airline to come up with a “mitigation plan” by Sept. 30. The FAA said two findings “revealed possible regulatory issues” but did not describe them. Schiavo  —   author of “Flying Blind, Flying Safe,” a book critical of the FAA  —   said the agency needs to take a tougher stance.  “I think that the FAA bears some responsibility for this horrible track record,” said Schiavo, who works at the law firm Motley Rice, which specializes in   lawsuits but has not been involved in any cases involving Allegiant. “The FAA sees its job as promoting the airlines and keeping them flying. They really try to keep just about any hunk of junk” flying. The FAA documents suggest that the agency had expressed concerns before. When Allegiant Air sought FAA approval of a new safety chief, the agency in a Feb. 1, 2016, report described qualifications for the position  —   “the education” and “vast experience” needed to “help lead the airline in providing the public with the safest means of commercial travel”  —   and then said it approved the appointment “with concern and trepidation. ” An Allegiant spokesman, Hilarie Grey, referred The Post to the FAA for comment. The FAA did not elaborate. Gallagher said the findings of this year's FAA inspection were “minor or less than minor. ” “So when you send 30 people around for 90 days in any organization, they're going to find stuff, as well they should. And we'll respond and adjust it,” Gallagher said in a July 29 conference call with securities analysts. But he said “there's nothing that operationally we're going to do substantially different. ” The FAA said it “will closely monitor” the carrier's efforts.    Allegiant told the FAA that for the 15 months ending in March, its 50 McDonnell Douglas planes  —   including   and    —   had 50 unscheduled landings, five emergency descents and eight aborted takeoffs. (Michael  )  Operational incidents The FAA's Service Difficulty Reports cover issues ranging from a   light bulb on a cabin exit sign to an engine failure. The Post examined FAA reports from Allegiant for 15 months ending in March and focused on the three types of operational incidents that aviation experts deem most significant: emergency descents, unscheduled landings and aborted takeoffs. The Post then compared Allegiant's record with Delta's by obtaining and reviewing reports filed by Delta for the same aircraft models for the same period. Delta flies more than twice as many   and   and more than four times as many of the Airbus models, but Allegiant had many more serious incidents. Allegiant told the FAA that its 50 McDonnell Douglas planes  —   including   and    —   had 50 unscheduled landings, five emergency descents and eight aborted takeoffs. From Jan. 1, 2015, through the end of March 2016, Delta reported that its 117   aircraft had six unscheduled landings, one emergency descent and no aborted takeoffs. For its 30 Airbus jetliners, Allegiant reported five unscheduled landings, two aborted takeoffs and one emergency descent. Delta reported that its 126 Airbus planes had one unscheduled landing, no aborted takeoffs and no emergency descents. Allegiant's Bricker said that “the reporting criteria [to the FAA] is open to interpretation and therefore is vastly different from fleet to fleet. ” In less than a year, a single Allegiant   had almost as many incidents as the entire Delta fleet of   FAA records show. In August 2015, that plane took off from Memphis and was at 16, 000 feet, climbing to cruising altitude, when one of its two engines shut down. The crew declared an emergency and landed the plane. In November, the same plane made an unscheduled landing after flight attendants said the air in the cabin had grown hazy and they smelled something burning. Three weeks later, the plane's pilot made another unscheduled landing after a gray haze filled the cabin. During a flight 12 days after that, the plane had reached cruising altitude when the cockpit crew noticed the “odor of evaporating oil,” which led to the replacement of the left engine before the plane was flown again. Repeated problems with other Allegiant   were common. One aircraft made three unscheduled landings. Another was met by firetrucks this year after an engine failed in flight. Six months earlier, the same plane made an emergency descent and an unscheduled landing after its instrument panel started to smoke. That incident occurred 10 days after the same plane made an unscheduled landing when the tail compartment next to the plane's engines overheated. “I just don't like the look, feel or smell of their track record,” Schiavo said.  [‘I have people's blood on my feet': Severe turbulence on Allegiant Air flight lands passengers in hospital]  A caller to the FAA's hotline said that an Allegiant    suffered engine failures twice, on July 31 and Aug. 3, 2015, both times en route to Richmond from St. Petersburg. On one of those flights, the crew reported the smell of burning rubber and a grinding noise followed by the failure of an engine. A maintenance crew later found a compressor “severely damaged,” and the engine was replaced, the FAA said. Bricker said that Allegiant takes “older airplanes to isolated areas, where we don't have our own mechanics” and therefore they are more likely to turn back if there's trouble.    Allegiant says it will spend more on maintenance this year. (Michael  )  Clashes with union Allegiant says the controversy about its safety record is due in large part to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. The airline's pilots voted to join the Teamsters in 2012 and, after prolonged negotiations, reached an agreement with the company on June 21. A company spokesman said the union had made a “significant effort” to create “negative media coverage” of Allegiant. The company said that “one of those tactics” was to issue safety reports about the fleet. “There's never been any denial or doubt or rebuttal by the company to refute the number of engine failures, aborted takeoffs or near crashes,” said Daniel C. Wells, president of Teamsters Local 1224. “No one ever said those were false reports. ” The union has issued safety reports on Allegiant for the past three years that are based on what its members have reported. Wells said the contract would “not lessen our concern about getting the safety issues fixed with Allegiant, first for our members and, of course, the flying public. ” The company said in a statement: “Allegiant is a very safe airline. We have robust internal and external auditing programs and are investing heavily in new training programs and technologies that are industry leading. ” Allegiant says it will spend more on maintenance this year. According to the MIT Airline Data Project, Allegiant's maintenance spending hit $72. 7 million in 2011, then fell to $33. 6 million and $38. 7 million the next two years, less than in any other year since 2008, when it was a much smaller company. Maintenance spending climbed again, to $62. 3 million, in 2014. Allegiant spokeswoman Wheeler said the fluctuations were “largely driven by scheduled maintenance events. ” She said that in 2011, the airline “underwent a   engine overhaul project. ” The company said that it is in regular contact with the FAA and that its maintenance programs are “in accordance with all standards of the airline industry. ” On Aug. 5, it cut the ribbon on a new training center in Florida for pilots, flight attendants and mechanics. Higher maintenance spending could cut into profits  —   and the company's stock price. The fortunes of chief executive Gallagher are tied to that performance. Although he does not take a base salary, he owns about 20 percent of the company and received more than $4 million in dividends last year. On March 9, he sold shares of Allegiant worth $47. 8 million. Despite the string of safety incidents in 2015, the company's board also gave him a nearly $3 million bonus, putting his total compensation for that year at the same level as his counterpart's at   rival JetBlue, which is about four times larger. Waiting for a resolution Kinzer isn't flying these days. Broke and unable to get a job in aviation, he is trying to start a photography business and is waiting for the court case to begin. Bricker and Wheeler declined to comment on the litigation. Allegiant's attorneys in Nevada moved in federal court to have the case dismissed. A judge rejected the motion and sent the case back to state court. On July 18, Kinzer's attorneys filed depositions, including one by Capt. Cameron Graff, a witness for Allegiant, who in reply to a question said: “It's my opinion that Capt. Kinzer was terminated to quell the pilot group, to silence the pilot group, to in a way ‘take one out' to keep the pilots from reporting safety events, emergencies, those types of events. ”  Steven Rich contributed to this report.

143534,214875,Trump's latest plan would target at least 5 million undocumented immigrants for deportation,Washington Post,Jose A. DelReal,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160902000145/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-latest-plan-would-target-at-least-5-million-undocumented-immigrants-for-deportation/2016/09/01/d6f05498-7052-11e6-9705-23e51a2f424d_story.html
","  PHOENIX  —   Trump's latest immigration proposals would require a dramatic and costly expansion of the U. S.   system  —   targeting millions more people for immediate removal while also making it much harder for millions of others to enter the country legally. The deportation priorities outlined by the Republican presidential nominee during a policy address here late Wednesday would target at least 5 million and as many as 6. 5 million undocumented immigrants for swift removal, or about half of the 11 million estimated to be living in the USA. And he left open the possibility that he would seek to deport many more as well. “Anyone who has entered the USA illegally is subject to deportation,” Trump said.  Trump delivered a series of similarly sweeping statements and proposals during the   speech, following a tortuous   period in which he had signaled that he might soften his tone on the issue instead. He not only called for removing all undocumented immigrants who had committed crimes, but also said he would prioritize the deportation of those who have overstayed their visas.  To accomplish that goal, he said he would triple the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and create a “new special deportation task force” to track the most serious security threats.        “We will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. We will break the cycle. There will be no amnesty,” he said. “Our message to the world will be this: You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the USA by illegally entering our country. Can't do it. ”  [  Trump's immigration speech]  That speech, which followed a quick visit to Mexico earlier Wednesday to meet with President Enrique Peña Nieto, effectively shut down speculation that he would move toward the center on immigration issues before Election Day. Many Republican strategists hoped that such a move would help him court moderate voters and regain ground against his Democratic rival, Clinton. His speech also prompted resignations on Thursday by several members of his Hispanic Advisory Council, who said they felt misled by earlier overtures. There has been widespread confusion about Trump's position in recent weeks, in part because he has repeatedly contradicted himself in public statements about mass deportation. He said in Phoenix that what becomes of the 11 million undocumented immigrants “will never be a central issue” even as he vowed that he would begin removing millions on “day one, as soon as I take office. ” And although he rejected any possible path to legal status  —   or “amnesty”  —   during that speech, he suggested Thursday during an interview with conservative radio host Laura Ingraham that he would revisit legalization after his border security policies were enacted. Despite the confusion, what is clear is that Trump's specific deportation prescriptions would require an expansive effort.  An estimated 690, 000 undocumented immigrants have committed significant crimes that would make them security priorities  —   felonies or serious misdemeanors  —   according to a study by the Migration Policy Institute. That number is closer to 2 million according to some, including Jessica Vaughan of the   Center for Immigration Studies, whom the Trump campaign has consulted on the issue. If visa overstays are included in the immediate priorities, as Trump said he would order during his speech, the number would grow by about 4. 5 million people, according to estimates that place overstays at about 40 percent of the total undocumented population.             Caption   Politicians, comedians, artists and developers hit back at Trump's inflammatory speech.   Oct. 3, 2015 Mexican comedians put on a play called “Los Hijos de Trump,” or “Sons of Trump.” In this play, Trump and his   carbon copies steal from the blind and bribe the police. The play was adapted from another play, a satire on big spenders, ”Brokers.” Henry    "

","   John Rakolta Jr. was skeptical as he headed to a private meeting with Trump in July at Chicago's Trump International Hotel. The Michigan construction executive, a longtime ally of 2012 Republicans nominee Mitt Romney and a top fundraiser for Sen. Marco Rubio, was not yet sold on raising funds for Trump. But the Trump who Rakolta encountered in a suite on the 27th floor was nothing like the provocateur he expected. “He is extremely ” Rakolta said. “None of the stuff that I imagined. ” The two had a   discussion about why auto companies build plants in countries such as Mexico instead of the USA. Rakolta left with newfound enthusiasm. Trump left with a new talking point. “I have a friend who builds plants, and he's a great builder of plants, and I was with him the other day  —   great guy,” the candidate told reporters a few weeks later. “And I said, ‘How's it going?' He said, ‘Unbelievable. . . The plants I'm building in Mexico, I've never seen anything  —   it's the eighth wonder of the world.' And he's not happy. He's an American guy. He'd rather build them here. ” The NY billionaire, who has cast himself as free from the influence of the party's donor class, has spent this summer forging bonds with wealthy Republicans financiers  —   seeking their input on how to run his campaign and recast his policies for the general election, according to more than a dozen people who have participated in the conversations. Private meetings with top contributors turn into strategy brainstorming sessions.   dinner fundraisers are transformed into impromptu focus groups. During a July lunch at a Southampton, N. Y. estate, he spent at least an hour asking the 60 heavyweight contributors in attendance to each share their pick of who he should tap as his running mate. At a photo line with donors in Minneapolis in August, he polled whether he should continue using a teleprompter at public events. At a mountainside chateau in Aspen last week, he quizzed locals about how the campaign could better compete in Colorado. And in a pistachio orchard outside a supporter's home in Tulare, Calif. this week, he queried farmers about how to create a “permit” system for undocumented workers. The episodes illustrate how Trump, who has a tiny circle of intimates, is turning to the wealthy business leaders he encounters on the fundraising circuit to serve as an ad hoc kitchen cabinet. He appointed many of his biggest financial backers to his economic advisory council, including Wisconsin billionaire Diane Hendricks, investor Tom Barrack and oil executive Harold Hamm. And there are already signs of how Trump is incorporating ideas from donors into his campaign.  [Trump is finally raising money. So why isn't he spending it?]  The most dramatic example came in August during a fundraiser in East Hampton, N. Y. when conservative benefactor Rebekah Mercer touted the merits of Breitbart News chief Stephen K. Bannon in a conversation with Trump about his campaign leadership. Days later, Trump sidelined campaign chairman Paul Manafort and effectively replaced him with Bannon. Several days later, casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson privately urged Trump to show more humility and treat people with more respect, as the NY Times first reported. The next day, the candidate issued a rare apology for causing “personal pain. ” In a statement, Trump told The Washington Post that he has “met some really wonderful people while raising money for the RNC. They do also like that I am personally investing many millions in my own campaign. Some of the people I've met I'm sure will be lifelong friends. ” When asked about the perception that donors have input on his   spokeswoman Hope Hicks responded that Trump “is an excellent listener and welcomes the advice of people he respects. ” “It is a great leadership quality and reflective of his creative, bold thinking that proved to be so successful throughout his career,” she added. In private, supporters see a side of Trump that sharply contrasts with his persona on stage at his raucous rallies. Solicitous and restrained, he disarms those expecting a  . “I had heard he was a different person than you see in the media, but you don't know until you experience it,” said Janet Beihoffer, a national committeewoman for the Minnesota Republicans, who was struck by how engaged the candidate was during the photo line in Minneapolis several weeks ago. “I was floored. ” Over and over, donors said they were impressed by Trump's attentiveness  —   he leans in close, moves his chair over, focuses only on what they are saying  —   as well as his intense efforts to glean new information. “I had no idea what to expect, and I was very pleasantly surprised by how well he listened to what I had to say,” said Andrew Sabin, the owner of a New     refining business, who met privately with the candidate earlier this summer in the Hamptons to assess whether he wanted to contribute to his campaign. “No arrogance, you know, ‘I'm Trump, the king of the world.' He sat back and wanted to know what your opinion was. ” The two men discussed immigration, among other topics, and Sabin said he made the case that it was impractical to deport the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the USA, as the candidate had insisted in the primaries that he would do through a “deportation force. ” Several weeks after their meeting, Trump set off a storm of confusion by suggesting that he was still assessing whether all undocumented immigrants would be subject to immediate deportation. Sabin was heartened. “I think he liked what he heard,” he said.  [Trump risks alienating voting blocs with wavering on immigration]  Peter Leidel, a   energy investor, was impressed with how the candidate solicited ideas from a dozen donors at a breakfast fundraiser at Trump Tower in NY in early August. “To every person who said something, he would ask questions and say, ‘Let me get this straight,' ” Leidel recalled. “He would jot things down. ” When it was Leidel's turn, the investor told Trump that he should do more to highlight Clinton's “bad judgment” for supporting the war in Iraq and Obama's   overhaul. Trump scribbled “judgment” in his notebook as Leidel spoke, a word he had used as a cudgel against his Democratic rival in the past. The very next morning, Trump took up the attack again, tweeting: “Clinton has bad judgment and is unfit to serve as President. ” “I don't know if it was me or not,” Leidel said of Trump's tweet. “But I think listening is a very important skill. I think a lot of people pretend they are listening, and they don't even care what you're saying. ” Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, who hosted Trump at his Southampton estate in July, described the candidate as “very relaxed, very   and very, very good at including everybody in the conversation. ” “It's a different persona from the one you see at the big rallies,” Ross said, “and much more like his persona when he is hosting parties at    or at one of his golf courses. ” Andy Puzder, chief executive of CKE Restaurants, said Trump's style behind closed doors reminds him of how he himself conducts business meetings. “He says to the guys and gals, ‘So what do you think of this?' ” Puzder said. “Whatever he is working on, he tries to get input on. That's what I do. ” In one case, the restaurant chain executive recalled that Trump walked into a small group of donors gathered at Trump Tower in June and said, “Who do you guys think I should pick for vice president?” Indiana Gov Pence, his eventual selection, was among those discussed. While Trump has reportedly little appetite for fundraising, he has kept up a busy pace of pricey events in August, headlining more than 20 receptions and dinner s, including some that cost up to $100, 000 a couple, according to a tally of invitations by The Post. (Unlike Clinton, who was on her own fundraising spree in August, Trump does not disclose when he is attending fundraisers, who is hosting them or the minimum donation required.)  [Inside the exclusive events helping to fund Clinton and the Democrats]  Each gathering serves as another sounding board. At an August dinner in Canton, Ohio, he quizzed about 30 donors at a local country club for their thoughts on local business issues. “He would say, ‘How would you solve that? What would you do?' ” recalled Doug Sibila, the chief executive of a warehouse and transportation company, who weighed in on what he views as onerous Department of Labor regulations. “As he shared some of his ideas and opinions, you can see they were in process, that he was willing to adapt based on what made sense. ” Their biggest regret, many donors said, is that more Americans do not get to see the private Trump. People view him as “off the cuff, but I think he is actually very thoughtful and measured,” Leidel said. “He is not going to make a decision without listening to advisers. ” At the breakfast fundraiser at Trump Tower in early August, where he went into details about his approach to issues such as the war in Syria, attendees urged Trump to share more policy specifics in public. “At the rallies, if I give much more than a   sentence, I lose the audience,” Trump responded, according to Leidel. “I want to keep their attention. ”  Sean Sullivan contributed to this report.

","      Bald but beaming,    Eden Oyelola yanked the long rope to ring the “victory bell” at Children's National Medical Center last September. She was finally done with her treatment for brain cancer  —   surgery followed by months of radiation and chemotherapy that made her terribly ill. At a “bell party” at her home in Upper Marlboro, Md. later that week, she gobbled down ice cream with friends and rode a pony around the back yard. Her parents exhaled in relief. “We thought she was in the clear,” her father said. The relief was  . In January, the little girl who loved gymnastics started having seizures and losing control of her left side. She frequently stumbled. “What's wrong with my legs?” she asked. A second surgery followed after an MRI showed that the tumor had returned, forcing her doctors at Children's to ask whether there was anything else that would give Eden a chance to survive.  The team ultimately turned to the hottest field in medicine and a new class of drugs that has had stunning success in some adults, including former president Jimmy Carter, with even    malignancies. Growing ranks of pediatric oncologists are considering immunotherapy and “checkpoint inhibitors” to try to save desperately ill children.  But young patients with cancer present a special challenge. Research can seem more dangerous because of their age, and drugs that work in adults may fail for the same reason. No one can yet say with certainty whether  —   or to what degree  —   these treatments hold equal promise for children. That allows for hope as well as, in Eden's case, devastating disappointment. “It's a new horizon that we need to explore and see if it can help these kids,” said Brian Rood, Eden's  . “But we're still learning how to use it. ”   [Immunotherapy shows promise in a growing list of cancers]   Immunotherapy, which one specialist calls “the fourth pillar of cancer treatment” after surgery, radiation and chemo, marshals the body's immune system to fight a malignancy. As part of that approach, checkpoint inhibitors disrupt a cloaking device tumors wield to evade and suppress T cells, the foot soldiers of the immune system. Once T cells can see the cancer, they attack it just as they would other foreign intruders such as bacteria.    Four checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for adults, but they are only now undergoing broader testing in children. The lag reflects the many significant hurdles of conducting clinical trials with this age group. Eden's doctors set their hopes on a     clinical trial led by Children's, a study testing a checkpoint inhibitor treatment in children who have aggressive brain tumors. The complex strategy has its own set of risks; the treatment often causes inflammation and swelling, a dangerous combination in the contained space of the brain. In describing the trial to Eden's parents, Rood was cautious. Their daughter would need yet another surgery to reduce the size of her tumor, and there was no guarantee she would be eligible for the trial after that, or that the treatment would work. “About the best we can say,” Rood acknowledged, “is that we don't know that it doesn't work. ” “Eden will be a guinea pig,” thought Eden's mother, Sara Amare. But like her husband, Toks Oyelola, she was eager to press ahead. Both knew that the study medication, Keytruda, also called pembrolizumab, was the same one that Carter received after advanced melanoma spread to his liver and brain. Last December, following surgery, radiation and the immunotherapy, the former president announced that his cancer had disappeared. “He was 91,” Amare said. “I thought, ‘Surely, this will work in a   .' ”    As a child with cancer, Eden belongs to a relatively small group. An estimated 16, 000 children up to age 19 will be diagnosed with the disease in the USA this year, and it will kill fewer than 2, 000. By contrast, about 1. 6 million adults are expected to get a diagnosis, and more than 590, 000 will die of the disease. Pediatric oncologists complain that medicines for children are too few and too toxic, largely because drug companies focus their efforts on the adult market. Only one immunotherapy drug has been specifically approved for pediatric cancer. “Over the last 30 years, we have had very, very few new drugs in our clinics, and we still rely on radiation and chemo,” said Michael Jensen, director of the Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research at Seattle Children's. “When a drug is developed for prostate cancer or breast cancer or colon cancer, they will say, ‘Here, try this for kids with brain tumors.' It really doesn't help these underserved kids. ”       Eden likes drawing, ponies, and the toy babies and pets called Twozies. (Michael S.   Washington Post)  Researchers have long known that children are not simply miniature adults; they are biologically different. They tend to get different cancers than adults  —   leukemia rather than lung cancer, for example  —   and even the same cancer can play out differently in their bodies. So, perhaps, may immunotherapy. Many adult tumors have mutations caused by cigarette smoke, sunlight and other environmental insults. Once unmasked by a checkpoint inhibitor, such mutations can be seen by the immune system as “foreign” and deserving of attack. Children's cancers, however, generally have far fewer mutations and thus may offer fewer targets, according to one theory.   [Checkpoint inhibitor helps melanoma patients survive longer ]   Another kind of immunotherapy, called   cell therapy, is being widely tested in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common and once universally fatal childhood cancer. It has shown extraordinary effectiveness in treating recurrent disease.  By contrast, checkpoint inhibitors in children “may not be the home run they are in adults,” said Crystal Mackall, head of the cancer immunology and immunotherapy program at the Stanford University School of Medicine. “But it's too early to know. ”  The Oyelola family lives in a comfortable house in a gated community in Prince George's County, with a back yard big enough to accommodate pony rides on special occasions. Eden, who is obsessed with unicorns, has a    sister, Sade, and an    brother, Tobi. “He chases me, then I chase him,” Eden said on a recent afternoon as the children raced around. Dressed in a shirt decorated with lions, tigers and zebras, she showed little sign of being sick, other than a little puffiness in her face and slightly shorter hair where she had surgery.     Eden and her sister, Sade, 7, look at a picture book of animals and insects as they play in their home in Upper Marlboro, Md. (Michael S.   Washington Post)  Eden's father is a consultant for Ernst & Young whose parents came from Nigeria decades ago. Her mother is a native of Ethi o pia who moved to the USA as a little girl. A wall of photographs in the family room shows a handsome and happy family. On Halloween 2014, Oyelola remembers, “a new normal” took hold. Amare was driving their daughters home from a school parade  —   Eden had been dressed up as the country of Russia. Suddenly, Sade cried from the back seat: “Mommy, Eden is shaking!” Saliva foamed on her lips. Doctors at Children's diagnosed a febrile seizure, a   event in childhood. But several weeks later, another seizure followed. This time, Children's did a scan. “We see a mass,” the doctors told Amare. Brain surgery was scheduled for Christmas Eve. Eden's family decorated her   room with lights, wreaths and a tree. When she woke up on Christmas, she was amazed by the presents, sneaked in by nurses, and by a visit from Santa Claus himself. Those would be the only bright spots of the holiday. The ultimate diagnosis was that Eden had a “primitive, very rare, very unusual tumor,” Rood said, with many of the characteristics of glioblastoma. This deadly type of cancer arises from glia cells, which support brain function. Months of radiation and chemo followed, ending with the bell party in September 2015. Late last year, the    Foundation arranged for the family to go on an   scavenger hunt that culminated in a ride on a “unicorn” at Verizon Center. “Yes, it's a real unicorn!” Eden declared, caressing the big white horse.  The tumor's return in January was a crushing blow. Eden quickly had surgery and eventually entered a clinical study involving pomalidomide, a thalidomide derivative that is thought to interfere with tumor growth. She began getting violent headaches. “She could wake up in the morning and be hysterical for two hours,” her father said. And she was having three to four seizures an hour.    Eden's father, Toks Oyelola, wears a variety of inspirational wristbands. As her tumor grew, he pushed her doctors hard for treatment alternatives. (Michael S.   Washington Post)   The doctors took her off the medicine and talked to her parents about the immunotherapy trial and another operation. “It was ” Rood said. Yet they had no other options. In late May, Eden had her third surgery, which succeeded in sharply reducing the tumor and the swelling, and in easing her pain. A few days later, she celebrated her sixth birthday.  Not long after, she got a spot in the Children's trial.  Brain and    tumors are the    type of childhood cancers, after leukemia. A patient's prognosis depends on the type of malignancy, whether cancer cells remain after surgery and whether the tumor recurs.  Given the success seen with checkpoint inhibitors for some adult cancers, there is intense interest in trying them in brain tumors in patients of all ages. The hope is that the immune system will be effective at attacking the tumor and breaching the   barrier, a kind of security system that protects the brain yet also prevents many treatments from getting through. Several pediatric trials are underway or in development, including one trying a combination of checkpoint inhibitors that NY's Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has set for next year.   [How cancer gets around the new immunotherapy drugs]   The    trial at Children's and other institutions is   by the National Cancer Institute and the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, a network of children's hospitals and academic medical centers that conducts   studies of novel treatments. Up to 70 patients will be enrolled, ages 1 to 21, with participants given infusions of Keytruda for 30 minutes every three weeks. The treatments are slated to extend over two years.    Sara Amare has relied on her faith during the nearly two years since her daughter Eden was diagnosed with cancer. (Michael S.   Washington Post)  Eugene Hwang, a pediatric   at Children's, and the other investigators are proceeding carefully because of the risks, frequently “pausing” the study to examine results and decide whether changes are needed. One of the toughest challenges in using checkpoint inhibitors or any immunotherapy for brain tumors, Hwang said, is figuring out how to produce the right level of immune response. Too weak and it won't affect the tumor. But too strong and the swarm of T cells could trigger lethal swelling.  “I have desperation in my back yard, where kids are dying, and there's hope the next yard over, where adults who have failed trial after trial are surviving,” said Hwang, the study chairman. “There is nothing that is going to dissuade me from trying something that has really revolutionized care for many adults. ”  Eden got her first dose of Keytruda on June 22, and everything seemed fine for the first two weeks. But shortly before her planned second dose, she again began having headaches, and numbness in her left arm. An MRI showed that the mass in her head had doubled in size in barely a month. That raised a critical issue for her physicians: Did the larger mass mean the drug had triggered the robust immune response they wanted? Or was the treatment failing and the cancer's growth accelerating? Or some combination of both? It was impossible to tell from the scan. Yet the answer would determine whether Eden could continue in the trial. The doctors delayed the second dose and gave her steroids to reduce the brain swelling. That effectively negated the effects of the immunotherapy, but it was the only way to figure out what was happening as they chose how to proceed. Her family tried to carry on with life. They all took a vacation to the beach, making sure they visited Assateague Island to see the wild ponies. Eden seemed to be doing well, and her parents were increasingly sure she would soon get her second Keytruda dose. But on July 28, she awoke in intense pain and was rushed the 20 miles to Children's. The tumor had gotten significantly bigger in just a few weeks and was starting to push the brain from the right side of her head toward the left. Blood and fluid also appeared to be leaking into the space between the brain and the skull. Doctors treated Eden with high levels of painkillers and higher levels of steroids. And they sat down with her parents. Rood told them that the tumor's fast growth was making it impossible for Eden to stay on the trial. Take her home, Rood suggested, and make her as comfortable as possible. “I can't accept that,” Amare said later, even as she talked about going “the God route. ” At her request, pastors from her Ethio pian Orthodox church have come to pray for her daughter.  Her husband is similarly torn. The doctors, he said, “don't expect a miracle to happen. But I do. ” Eden still romps through the house and plays with her dogs, Winter and Summer. On a recent afternoon, bored for the moment, she climbed onto her father's lap and whispered in his ear to take her to Target. She wanted to get more Twozies to add to her already sizable collection of the toy babies and pets. “Okay,” Oyelola said with a smile. “Let's go. ” "
143537,214878,A hurricane hasn't made Florida landfall in over 10 years. Hermine is set to end that streak.,Washington Post,Brian McNoldy,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160902000145/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/09/01/a-hurricane-hasnt-made-florida-landfall-in-over-10-years-hermine-may-end-that-streak/
","    Florida is about to experience its first landfalling hurricane in more than a decade. The National Hurricane Center announced on Thursday afternoon that Hermine, previously a tropical storm, attained hurricane intensity at 2:55 p. m. Eastern Thursday. At the same time, radar imagery revealed an eye emerging at the center of the storm, a telltale indicator that a hurricane was developing. Intense bands of wind and rain were already lashing Florida's Gulf Coast from Tampa to Panama City. Florida has not experienced hurricane conditions since 2005 during Hurricane Wilma. In fact, the entire Gulf of Mexico hasn't had a hurricane since Ingrid in 2013. A hurricane warning is in effect for Florida from the Suwannee River to Mexico Beach. The center of Hermine could make landfall anywhere between those locations. A dangerous storm surge is possible as the storm rolls ashore on Thursday night  —   particularly on the south side of the storm  —   and flooding will be exacerbated by heavy rain. A storm surge warning is in effect from Franklin County through Hernando County. The highest surges are expected in coastal Wakulla, Jefferson and Taylor counties, and could reach 6 to 7 feet in the most vulnerable locations.      The timing of the tides will determine which locations get the worst impacts from storm surge. Unlike Sandy in 2012, which arrived precisely at one of the highest astronomical tides of the year, Hermine should make landfall near low tide in Apalachicola, Fla. which reduces the net water level by about 1. 2 feet. But in Cedar Key, roughly 150 miles farther down the coast, the storm is expected to make landfall closer to high tide when the water level is about 3. 2 feet higher than at low tide. Some of Apalachicola's worst storm surge events include Hurricane Dennis in 2005 and Hurricane Elena in 1985, and Hermine's surge could rival the surge produced by Category 3 Hurricane Dennis, which hit near Pensacola.      People on Florida's Gulf Coast boarded up windows and nailed plywood across shop fronts on Sept. 1 as they braced for Hurricane Hermine to make landfall on Thursday evening. (AP)   Another major threat facing north Florida and the Southeast USA in the coming hours and days is inland flooding caused by excessive rainfall. Through Sunday morning, a vast swath of the Big Bend and panhandle will get over six inches of rain. Some isolated areas could see more than 10 inches, especially where heavy rain bands form. After passing over Florida, Hermine will track along the East Coast, bringing heavy rain to Georgia and the Carolinas. How far inland the storm tracks is still a question mark until the center passes through Florida and back over water in the Atlantic.     rainfall forecast, valid from Thursday morning through Sunday morning. (NOAA)  All landfalling tropical cyclones bring with them the risk of tornadoes. Hermine is no exception, and there is an elevated threat of tornadoes from the central Florida peninsula up into southeastern Georgia Thursday and Thursday night, including much of the Florida Panhandle. Tropical   tornadoes are generally not on the high end of the scale, but even   and   tornadoes are capable of causing damage to homes and trees. Florida has not experienced hurricane conditions since Oct. 24, 2005, when Wilma hit near Naples as a Category 3 storm. As of Thursday, that is 3, 965 days (10. 9 years) a span that is nearly 1, 800 days (4. 9 years) longer than the previous “hurricane drought. ” Note that the   average return period is just 507 days (1. 4 years) or roughly five every seven years.

","         “Last week, you could tell, there was the real possibility of a pivot. I think there was a big fight within the campaign, and I think the restrictionist forces won. ” Those words come from Alfonso Aguilar, a leading Latino conservative. Until yesterday, Aguilar was a prominent surrogate for Trump. But Trump delivered a hardline speech on immigration last night, and now top Latino supporters like Aguilar are bolting. Aguilar, who has been in regular touch with members of the National Hispanic Advisory Committee for Trump, a group formed by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, tells me that he expects as many as a half a dozen members of the Committee to step down or otherwise withdraw their support. The speech and fallout, said Aguilar, the head of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, are “a debacle for the Trump campaign. ” Latino conservatives thought there was a real chance that Trump might genuinely moderate on the issue, Aguilar said, perhaps by declaring himself open to some form of expedited path to legal status for those undocumented immigrants who leave the country and return. But in his speech last night, Trump flatly ruled out any such expedited pathway. To Latino conservatives, there is no doubt about the true intentions of Trump's speech, even though there are still a few observers here and there who continue to suggest that he somehow softened his approach yesterday. Trump stopped using the words “deportation force,” but he nonetheless made it absolutely clear that maximum deportations and stepped up enforcement are his guiding priorities, and also left no doubt that there simply isn't any meaningful path to assimilation in Trump's vision. “He means, We're gonna start detaining people, left and right,” Aguilar said, adding that Trump's vision was akin to “putting ICE on steroids” and creating “a deportation regime with close collaboration with state and local police. ” Aguilar added, however, that he would not be supporting Clinton. Massey Villarreal, a   businessman who was also a member of the Trump advisory committee, has pulled his support, too. “He will not be supporting Trump, and he will not be supporting Clinton,” Villarreal's assistant told me. He told NBC Latino that Trump's speech was “awful. ” Still another member of the Trump advisory committee, Jacob Monty, a   lawyer, longtime Republican, and   Mexican American, told my Post colleagues Aaron Blake and Jenna Johnson that he had attended a meeting with Trump at which he seemed reasonable on immigration. But after Trump's speech, he feels that he was misled, and has now decided he's done: “The speech was just an utter disappointment,” Monty said in an interview on Thursday  …    . “We were out there defending him. And then to be just lied to like that  —   it doesn't feel good. It's not okay. ” Politico reports that another member of Trump's advisory council, Ramiro Pena, a pastor, has also pulled out: “I am so sorry but I believe Mr. Trump lost the election tonight,” said Pena, a pastor at Waco's Christ the King Church. “The ‘National Hispanic Advisory Council' seems to be simply for optics and I do not have the time or energy for a scam. ”  In his interview with me, Aguilar suggested that this really is the stuff of nightmares for the Republican National Committee. As you'll recall, the RNC put out that autopsy after the 2012 election, concluding that the party must broaden its appeal by supporting immigration reform and taking genuine steps to be more welcoming to Latino immigrants. Surrogates such as these are central to these types of outreach efforts, because they embody the case that the conservative agenda holds promise for Latinos. RNC chair Reince Priebus had gamely defended Trump as his campaign worked through what its immigration agenda would look like, promising that Trump would soon outline that agenda's specifics. Earlier this week, however, Priebus appeared not to know for sure what those specifics would look like, though he did promise that Trump's plan would be “humane. ” Aguilar told me he had been in touch with the Trump campaign in recent days, and came away believing that there had been an internal struggle over the issue, and that the restrictionists won. Now, Aguilar said, other Latino conservative leaders, including people the RNC has traditionally relied on to reach Latino voters, would soon be having a “conversation” to “figure out what to do. ” “Reince Priebus right now is probably in despair,” Aguilar said.

","     Trump's outreach to African Americans is as phony as anything he has said or done in this campaign (including the promise to make Mexico pay for the border wall). Until a couple of weeks ago, he showed little interest in African American voters, declining to give any speeches to predominantly black audiences. He comically refers to these Americans as “the blacks” (as in “The blacks love me! ”) and insists their lives are a “disaster. ” He imagines they all live in poverty and have “no jobs. ” He offers nothing of substance to address any issue of concern, from school reform to criminal justice reform. To the contrary, he shows disbelief or outright contempt for complaints from African American communities across the country about unequal treatment by the police. He did, however, promise to stop talking about African Americans to predominantly white audiences. His campaign chief Kellyanne Conway announced he would do outreach events to African American audiences, including black churches. Well, scratch the last part. On Wednesday, the Detroit Free Press reported that “Trump won't be speaking to the black congregation at Great Faith Ministries International  during the 11 a. m. service. And his Saturday interview with [Bishop Wayne T.] Jackson on the church's Impact Network  —   which will not be open to the public or the news media  —   won't air for at least a week after the event. ”      Speaking at a rally in Dimondale, Mich. Aug. 19, Republican presidential candidate Trump accused Democrat Clinton of exploiting African American voters. ”America must reject the bigotry of Clinton,” Trump said. (The Washington Post)   There is no explanation for this other than pure cowardice. He is showing up; he just won't meet in public with the congregants. (“Trump's first foray as a presidential candidate into a church of African Americans  was initially billed as a speech to the congregation to lay out his policies that impact minorities, followed by the interview with Jackson. ”) He was rightly blasted by Michigan state Sen. Coleman Young (D) and Detroit's mayor. Denise Horn, Clinton's director of African American media, told Right Turn via email, “Today we learned that Trump will bypass yet another opportunity to speak directly to the Black community. This comes as a surprise to no one. In every way imaginable Trump has bucked the tradition of presidential candidates, including his Republican predecessors. ” She recounted, “He declined the opportunity to speak at the NAACP convention, the National Urban League, and the National Association of Black Journalists, yet he still has the nerve to ask African Americans ‘what we have to lose' under his agenda. ” She added, “Trump continues to show us who he really is: an attention seeking opportunist with no real regard for the   of Black people. ” According to the Clinton campaign, Clinton has held 100 African   events, including conferences for the National Urban League and NAACP and the Congressional Black Caucus gala. It certainly would have been better for Trump not to have promised an appearance, indeed not to go with his      promise to go into neighborhoods Republicans do not campaign in. It was not going to help him with those voters anyway. Now, he has done something rare  —   shown a lack of confidence and fear of a media event that could spin out of control. The implicit message could not be any clearer. He loves, loves, loves speaking to huge audiences of whites. He talks off the top of his head. He needs no notes. He'll go to Washington state to talk to them. However, he cannot bring himself to make a single public appearance  —   even with a script in the teleprompter  —   to reassure African Americans that he cares about them. “If his sermon turned out to be anything like his tweets it could set race relations back a generation,” joked Rick Wilson, a Trump critic who is assisting independent conservative Evan McMullin. Well, he does have a point. The entire exercise is insincere, and his team is so lacking in diversity that what is meant to be outreach comes across as stereotyping and condescension. Trump's real problem  —   aside from the number of groups he has offended and his lack of money or campaign infrastructure  —   is that he is not only doing worse than Mitt Romney did with minorities but he is doing worse with white women and   whites. He's trying to convince white voters he's losing that he really isn't a bigot. This sure isn't going to help."

","   No, we shouldn't have blurred the “Trump 2016″   of a man who rescued an infant from a car in a New Jersey parking lot. That's what cable channel HLN is saying today. “We blurred the logo and shouldn't have; it was done in error,” reads a   statement from the network. Not just an error, a towering error. Steven Eckel, 53, a retired New Jersey police officer, used a sledgehammer on Monday to break the glass on a sweltering car parked at a shopping center in Howell, after    Sara Mazzone spotted the child. The two then pulled the infant girl from the car and attended to her. She “started to look better,” according to the NY Daily News. Like any good   outlet, HLN wanted to hear from Eckel himself. Host Christi Paul went through the whole event with Eckel, who was dressed in a blue   beaming “Trump 2016. ” “We were like, ‘Oh my God,' the baby was sweating, her hair was all wet,” said Eckel in the interview. So far, so good. Until HLN ran a subsequent piece on this act of heroism, that is. This time, the segment used footage from Paul's interview with Eckel, with one very important edit. To fully appreciate the difference  —   reported yesterday by the Daily Caller  —   here's a screenshot from the original:      And here's a screenshot from the subsequent report:    (Screenshot from HLN via YouTube)  See that? Someone at HLN made the effort to rub out the “Trump 2016″ from the   of an outstanding Samaritan who rescued an infant from a sweltering automobile!

","         Georgetown University plans to offer an apology for its participation in the institution of slavery, officials said, following the release of a report Thursday that scrutinized the sale of hundreds of   slaves in the early 19th century for the benefit of the Catholic school. In addition, the highly selective university in the nation's capital plans to give the descendants of slaves owned by Maryland Jesuits a boost in admissions, treating applicants from that community the same as it would those who are children of faculty, staff and alumni. And it will name a university residence hall after one of the slaves, a man named Isaac. He was 65 years old in 1838 when he and 271 other slaves were sold and shipped to a Louisiana plantation. Those are among several steps Georgetown is taking in response to a report from a panel of faculty, staff, students and alumni that examined the university's ties to slavery, including the 1838 sale. That transaction helped pay off debt at the Jesuit school then known as Georgetown College.   [Maryland Jesuits grateful for Georgetown slavery report]   Two Jesuit priests who took turns as president of Georgetown in those years, the Rev. Thomas Mulledy and the Rev. William McSherry, orchestrated the 1838 sale, for a price of $115, 000, or $3. 3 million today. The sale, which stirred debate at the time within the Society of Jesus, led to the shipment of slaves to Louisiana plantations, separating families. The episode has been known to scholars for decades. But it has drawn new attention in the past year amid an intensive dialogue about race relations on college campuses across the country. The panel, which Georgetown President John J. DeGioia convened a year ago, studied the sale and other issues connected to Georgetown and slavery. It said in its report to DeGioia that “a formal, spoken apology” would be appropriate “because its absence rings so loudly. ” “The University, despite the many ways that it has invested resources over the past half century to heal the wounds of racial injustice, has not made such an apology,” the report continued. “While there can be empty apologies, words of apology, genuinely expressed, make a difference in the quest for reconciliation. ” The report and the university's response drew emotional reactions from people who trace their lineage to those sold in 1838. Jessica Tilson, 34, a student at Southern University in Louisiana, said she was especially moved by the university's decision to dedicate one of its buildings to the memory of Isaac. Tilson said she is descended from him. Tilson was driving her mother to work Thursday when she got an email from Georgetown with news of the report. She said she burst into tears, pulled into a gas station parking lot and told her mother. They cried together, and talked about how they would tell Tilson's    grandfather. “I love the idea  —   all of it,” Tilson said. “Especially the name of the buildings. Isaac is my sixth great grandfather   …     When people name buildings after people, it shows how much you value them and respect them  …    . That means millions of children that come to that school for an education will learn about him. That is  —   I'm speechless. There are no feelings in the world that can describe how that feels. ” With the report, Georgetown joins a growing number of prominent colleges and universities that are giving new scrutiny to their various connections to the institution of slavery in America from colonial times through the Civil War. Brown University acknowledged its close ties to the   transatlantic slave trade in a groundbreaking 2006 report. The University of Virginia's governing board voted in 2007 to express regret for the use of slaves at the school Thomas Jefferson founded in 1819, a decade after the   Founding Father ended his second term as president. Georgetown, founded in 1789, is now revisiting its own deep entanglement with slavery, a story broader than the infamous 1838 sale. DeGioia, president of Georgetown since 2001,  in recent months has reached out personally to descendants of slaves the Jesuits sold in a quest to make amends for the actions of his predecessors. He met in June with descendants in Spokane, Wash. and in New Orleans, BatonRouge and elsewhere in Louisiana  —   40 to 50 in all, he said.

DeGioia, president of Georgetown University, in Spokane, Wash. in June.   is a descendant of slaves who were sold by Georgetown in 1838. (Jerry Johnson)  “We want to embrace them as members of our family,” DeGioia said in an interview Wednesday. DeGioia said he encountered “kindness and hospitality” as he expressed “a sincere desire on the part of the university to engage with them in a spirit of seeking reconciliation. ” Asked whether he had apologized to the descendants he met, DeGioia said that had not been his objective in the meetings. Instead, he said he wanted to introduce himself and begin a dialogue, even as he conveyed a sense of contrition for the university's actions. He also sought to place the issue in a wider context. As a nation, DeGioia said, “we're still coping with our failure to address the original evil of slavery. ” University officials indicated through a written statement Thursday that an apology is planned, one that will be “informed through the Catholic tradition,” including a Mass of Reconciliation to be held with the Archdiocese of Washington and the Society of Jesus in the USA. Read the panel's report here: Report presented to the president of Georgetown University  The Rev. David J. Collins, an associate professor of history who chaired the panel, said the members were clear that a full and formal apology was necessary. “Of course we want to say it,” Collins said in an interview. “What do you say to people, you know? You say, ‘I am sorry.' ” Over the past year, Georgetown has kept the Jesuits apprised of the panel's work. “As we have stated on other occasions, we deeply regret that part of our history,” a representative of the Jesuits, the Rev. James J. Miracky, said Thursday, speaking about the order's involvement with slavery. Miracky is the higher education liaison for the Maryland and Northeast provinces of the Jesuits. “It's important to embrace our past, to come to understand it and to be sorry for it,” he said. Miracky said the Jesuits, like Georgetown, are seeking to engage with the slave descendant community. Georgetown is one of a small group of schools that pledge to be “ ” in making admission decisions and meet the full need of all who enroll. It does not offer merit scholarships or other financial aid that is not based on need. Any aid program targeting the descendants of slaves would have to fit within those guidelines. The report is a milestone for the school of 18, 500 students that ranks among the nation's elite. Georgetown, like many prominent colleges, was long an   bastion. Its first African American students were enrolled in the university's law school in 1948, and its first African American undergraduate matriculated in 1950. Today about 6 percent of Georgetown's 7, 500 undergraduates are African American. Eight percent are Latino, 10 percent are Asian American and 4 percent are multiracial. The release culminated nearly a year of work by the   panel named the Working Group on Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation. At a little more than 100 pages, the report summarizes the close relationship between Maryland Jesuits, slavery and the college. The Jesuits, through colonial land grants, established plantations and began using slave labor on them around 1700. Those plantations became an enduring source of financial support for Georgetown, founded in 1789 as the first Catholic college in the newly independent nation. The college's founder, the Rev. John Carroll, who was the first bishop in the USA, owned at least one slave, whom he freed in his will. William Gaston, the college's first student, owned perhaps as many as 40 slaves but also supported the abolition of slavery on a number of occasions in public venues. The report notes that the “general attitude of Jesuit faculty and students favored slavery as at least a necessary evil” and that through the Civil War “the mood at the College was   and ultimately  . ” Most Georgetown alumni who fought in the war were in the rebel armies. Preliminary research suggests that there were more slaves on Georgetown's campus than previously thought, the report said. Some were brought by students. Some were rented from slave owners in the port of Georgetown, a hub of commerce for the slave society of Washington. The best estimate of the share of people on campus who were enslaved in the early 19th century is about 10 percent. All of that provides context for the sale of   slaves in 1838 and on other occasions. According to the report, Mulledy and McSherry organized the sale of 272 slaves to Louisiana businessmen while the former was college president and the latter held the title of superior of the Maryland Province of the Jesuits. The two priests swapped roles by the time the sale occurred. The slaves were taken from Maryland to various plantations in the Pointe Coupee, Iberville and Ascension parishes of Louisiana. Many were then sold and resold. The tragedy that befell those slaves is hardly unique. But the sale was one of the   of its kind in American history because the Jesuits kept meticulous records, many of them now at Georgetown's Lauinger Library. Exactly how much money from the sale came to Georgetown, and when, is uncertain. “We need to hammer this down a little bit more,” Collins said. “They certainly didn't get it all at once. ” But it is clear that $17, 000 from a down payment was used to pay down a Georgetown building debt, which translates to about $500, 000 today. What is also clear is that there was controversy over the sale within the Jesuit community at the time. Jesuit authorities in Rome were initially inclined to support emancipation, the report said, and they imposed several conditions on any sale, including a mandate that slave families should not be divided. That condition and others were not honored. In the aftermath, Mulledy was forced to resign as head of Jesuits in the USA and travel to Rome to avoid being dismissed from the order. Eventually he returned to become the first president of the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts, and he later served another term as president of Georgetown. Until last year, Mulledy and McSherry were honored at Georgetown through the usual way on a college campus: Two buildings were named for them. But as the university began to revisit the slave sale, a movement emerged last fall to improve the racial climate on college campuses around the country. Students at Georgetown held a   outside DeGioia's office in November to protest the Mulledy and McSherry building names and other issues.    About 30 students occupied a hallway in front of the office of John J. DeGioia, president of Georgetown, on Nov. 13. Demonstrators expressed solidarity with other student protests against racial discrimination and demanded that Mulledy Hall on campus be renamed. (Astrid Riecken for The Washington Post)  Soon afterward, the university removed plaques bearing the names and gave the buildings temporary names: Freedom Hall and Remembrance Hall.   [Georgetown to rename two buildings connected to slavery]   The panel's report recommended two permanent names for the buildings. The building once known as Mulledy Hall, now called Freedom Hall, should be renamed Isaac Hall, the report said, to honor the first of the 272 slaves listed in the articles of agreement for the 1838 sale. The other, once known as McSherry Hall and now called Remembrance Hall, should be renamed Anne Marie Becraft Hall, the report said, to honor a free woman of color of that name, “a trailblazing educator” who had roots in the Georgetown neighborhood in the 19th century. DeGioia said Georgetown's governing board approved the renaming of the two halls in July, and the school expects to move quickly to put that into motion. Among the panel's other recommendations:  Engage with the community of Maryland Jesuit slave descendants. Possible measures would be to support genealogical research, commission an oral history project, hold public events to tell the story of Jesuit slave holding and solicit input from descendants on a memorial for the people sold in 1838. Develop a public memorial to slaves and their families outside the two renamed halls, with names of the 272 preserved either as part of the memorial or inside the halls. Create an Institute for the Study of Slavery and its Legacies at Georgetown. Take other steps to publicize the school's history, including a historical walking tour of black Georgetown. Invest in diversity at Georgetown. One possible measure could be intensified recruiting of African American students, especially from Maryland, D. C. and Louisiana.  DeGioia said he is adamant that the panel's report should not be interpreted as a step toward closure of the issues. “Quite the contrary,” he said. “What we've been able to do is develop a road map to open up Georgetown to be a university in new kinds of ways. ”"

","    MIDWAY ATOLL  —   On Thursday, Obama touched down here, a sliver of land in the North Pacific so removed from other human development that it feels like the edge of the universe. For more than two years, he had been hoping to visit a place like this, even though his   counselor John D. Podesta told him America's most pristine marine reserves are “the middle of nowhere. ” But here, surrounded by the ocean and a population of seabirds so vast that it dictates when planes can fly certain times of the year, Obama celebrated his most dramatic action yet to safeguard the planet against climate change.  The president used the Midway visit to tout his decision last week to expand the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument to more than half a million square miles, making it the largest ecological preserve on Earth. After touching down, he gawked at a handful of threatened green sea turtles basking in the sun as small white terns glided nearby. He zipped along in a   motorcade on an island 1, 300 miles north of Hono lulu that used to serve as a critical U. S. military outpost.  Teeming with life  —   from the more than 1 million albatrosses that flock there every year to the endangered Hawaiian monk seals that haul themselves on land to pup  —   the monument area contains some of the world's most undisturbed habitats. Obama said that preserving it would allow us to “research and understand our oceans better than we ever have before,” in an era where they are under pressure from climate change.

143546,214887,These charts clearly show how some Olympic swimmers may have gotten an unfair advantage,Washington Post,Jeff Guo,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160902000145/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/01/these-charts-clearly-show-how-some-olympic-swimmers-may-have-gotten-an-unfair-advantage/
","     A few years ago, researchers from Indiana University discovered a disturbing pattern at the 2013 Swimming World Championships in Barcelona. According to the   data, athletes assigned to the outer lanes of the pool were consistently swimming faster in one direction than the other. A mysterious force seemed to be interfering with the competition. But before the researchers could investigate in person, the pool  —   a temporary facility constructed just for that event  —   was torn down. The same strange problem cropped up at the Rio Olympics, and nobody can explain why. Two independent statistical analyses show discrepancies large enough to cast doubt on the results of some races. The problem may have even cost swimmers medals.   [Why bronze medalists are happier than silver medalists, and other things the Olympics teaches us about human emotions]   The following chart  —   from Eastern Michigan University professor Andrew Cornett, and Indiana University's Christopher Brammer and Joel Stager  —   illustrates the lap time discrepancies in the Rio pool using data from the   races. Since competitors in those events make several laps back and forth along the    pool, the researchers could compare swimmers against themselves. Each dot represents a swimmer in one of the   and   races. The vertical position of the dot shows whether the athlete swam faster in one direction or the other.     In a perfectly fair pool, all of the dots should be near the zero line. In Rio, athletes in the middle lanes were relatively unaffected. But on the   side of the pool, competitors were about 0. 4 seconds faster swimming away from the starting blocks. The   side of the pool suffered from the opposite problem. Swimmers were about 0. 2 seconds slower in their outgoing laps compared to their return laps. (In all of this, the researchers ignored the first and last laps because those are strategic parts of the race.) To understand the pattern of lane bias, consider the example of Norwegian swimmer Henrik Christiansen, who is marked on the chart in pink. In his preliminary heat for the   race, Christiansen was assigned to Lane 2. In that race, his outgoing laps were 0. 28 seconds faster than his incoming laps, on average. When Christiansen made it through to the final, he was assigned to the other side of the pool. In Lane 8, Christiansen swam a completely different race. His outgoing laps were slower than his incoming laps.     Could this have cost someone the gold? Because most Olympic events require athletes to swim an even number of laps, the effects of any currents in the water should have somewhat canceled out. Those who got a boost swimming in one direction would have to fight the same force when they turned around. The one exception is the   freestyle, which only covers a single length of the pool. Barry Revzin, a data analyst based in Chicago who used to swim competitively at MIT, found compelling evidence of the lane effect by comparing swimmers' times as they rose through the heats and  . He took advantage of the fact that athletes were typically assigned different lanes as they progressed through the competition. On average, Revzin found that swimmers raced faster when they moved to   lanes, and slower when they moved to   lanes. By Revzin's estimates, shifting two lanes to the right in the Rio pool would have given a swimmer a boost of about 1 centimeter per second. In a   freestyle race at Olympic pace, that translates to a difference of about   of a second.     As Revzin notes, this is a significant difference. In both the men's and the women's   freestyle, the top three finishers were separated by less than   of second. We'll never know for sure, but the evidence raises questions about what would have happened if people had gotten different lane assignments. For instance, the women's bronze medalist, Belarus's Aliaksandra Herasimenia clocked 24. 11 seconds. She beat out defending gold medalist Ranomi Kromowidjojo of the Netherlands, who clocked a 24. 19. But Herasimenia swam in Lane 8, which the data suggest was the fastest lane. Kromowidjojo swam in Lane 3. The Indiana University researchers' data led them to a similar finding: The   lanes in Rio, they determined, may have given the   swimmers a boost of up to 1 percent relative to the middle lanes. The   lanes may have slowed them down by up to 1 percent. Revzin, who calls himself a ”huge swimming fan,” said he was deeply disappointed when he noticed the discrepancies. ”Sadness was the main emotion,” he said. ”This is not the kind of thing you want to see in the biggest competition in your sport,” he said.      University of Virginia physics professor Lou Bloomfield explains some of the fundamental forces at work in Olympic freestyle swimming, and how swimmers can use science to get ahead. (Thomas Johnson, Julio Negron, Danielle Kunitz, Osman Malik, Dani   Washington Post)   This is not an isolated event Because swimming races can be won by fractions of a second, pools must meet fairly exacting standards. The International Swimming Federation, known as FINA, writes the rules. On matter of currents in the water, though, FINA is a little vague. The official regulations say that “in order to observe health regulations in force in most countries, inflow and outflow is permissible as long as no appreciable current or turbulence is created. ” Both the pools in Rio and Barcelona were constructed by Myrtha Pools, an Italian company with extensive experience. According to a statement from FINA, Myrtha Pools told the officials that “no current was detected in the Olympic Aquatics Stadium pool, at any stage of the competitions. ”   [Why China's Olympic win might not be a cause for celebration]   The company did not respond to a request for comment, but two weeks ago, President Trevor Tiffany provided the swimming website SwimSwam with videos showing test objects floating motionlessly on the surface of the Rio pool. “All I can say is we tested the pool both before the event and after Day     Caption   From body parts washing up near the beach volleyball venue to insensitive commentary about gymnast Simone Biles, here's a look at moments that have roiled the Games.    Amidst a string of robberies of attendees, Ryan Lochte and three other swimmers also claimed they were robbed after a dance party at an Olympic venue. However, discrepancies have emerged in their accounts. Lochte said they were accosted by one robber, while another swimmer said there were several. Read more here.    Michael    "

"," The Romanian hacker who first revealed that Clinton used a private email address while she was secretary of state was sentenced to more than four years in federal prison Thursday by a U. S. district judge in Alexandria, Va. Marcel Lehel Lazar, 44, known online as “Guccifer,” was extradited in 2014 to the USA and pleaded guilty in May to one count each of aggravated identity theft and unauthorized access to a protected computer. Lazar admitted to victimizing about 100 Americans from his home overseas over 14 months. They included celebrities, business executives and political figures such as Sidney Blumenthal, an adviser with whom Clinton corresponded using her personal email account; confidantes of former president George W. Bush; and former secretary of state Colin L. Powell. U. S. District Judge James C. Cacheris imposed a   sentence, saying a tough penalty was needed to deter future hacking. He cited reports of escalating cyber attacks against Americans in recent years, including this week's FBI warnings of intrusions into state election systems. “This epidemic must stop,” Cacheris said.     The State Department released 52, 000 pages of Clinton's emails as part of a   process. Here's what else we learned from the publicly released emails. (Monica   Washington Post)    [Hacker who revealed Clinton email address admits to other intrusions]  Hacking passwords and employing   tactics including fraud, identity theft and harassment, Lazar stored megabytes of victims' stolen private documents and turned them over to media outlets. He also leaked pictures of Bush's paintings. “The extent of the harm caused by defendant's conduct is incalculable,” federal prosecutors wrote in seeking a maximum penalty of   years under U. S. sentencing guidelines. A maximum punishment “would also help address any false perception that unauthorized access of a computer is ever justified or rationalized as the cost of living in a wired society  —   or even worse, a crime to be celebrated,” Assistant U. S. Attorney Maya D. Song wrote.  [Cyber researchers confirm Russian government hack of DNC]  Prosecutors said a stern sentence could deter other violators. They cited the case of Guccifer 2. 0, an individual or group of hackers who U. S. officials say is tied to Russian intelligence services and who claimed credit for hacking the Democratic National Committee this year. The online publication of DNC emails by WikiLeaks led to the resignation of the committee's chair, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.) in July. Guccifer 2. 0 was branded “in homage to” Lazar, Song wrote. Contrary to Lazar's claims, authorities say he never obtained access to Clinton's email account.  [‘Guccifer 2. 0' claims credit for DNC hack]  In court documents, Lazar's public defense counsel asked for a sentence of three years, calling his hacking expeditions “an addiction of sorts. ” Despite his “admittedly brash   personality,” public defender Shannon S. Quill wrote, Lazar is actually a devoted father and husband who was frustrated by his inability to find work in the computer sector. “We need him because life is very hard in Romania,” his wife, Gabriela Violeta Lazar, wrote in a letter to the court. He was also motivated, Quill wrote, “to expose what he saw as hypocrisy, especially in those connected to the defense and intelligence sectors. ” A high school graduate, Lazar had no formal training or computer expertise. He told the NY Times that he obtained access to the email and   accounts of   people by reading their Wikipedia pages and guessing passwords based on their personal information. Once he had access to one person's account, he sometimes impersonated them to gain more passwords and personal information. Although he told the FBI that he was interested in politics and “a better world for our children,” he targeted a seemingly random mix of politicians and celebrities. Along with Bush and Powell, he exposed the personal information of magazine editor Tina Brown, author Candace Bushnell and actor Jeffrey Tambor. In his 2014 interview, Lazar told FBI agents that he trawled more or less randomly through the online accounts of “important people,” looking for weak spots. He succeeded only about 8 to 10 percent of the time, he estimated.  Prosecutors argued that although Lazar confessed, he showed no remorse and probably will return to hacking. He was on probation for a hacking offense in Romania when he began targeting American celebrities in 2012 and has been sentenced to seven years in prison there. If he could go back in time and talk to his 2012 self, prosecutors say that he told one FBI agent, “I'd say, ‘All right, you have done a good job.' ” Cacheris said Romania's Justice Ministry requested that Lazar be immediately released to his home country to serve his time there and indicated that he would be conditionally released in 2018 and returned to the USA to serve his prison term here.

","     Trump paid the IRS a $2, 500 penalty this year, an official at Trump's company said, after it was revealed that Trump's charitable foundation had violated tax laws by giving a political contribution to a campaign group connected to Florida's attorney general. The improper donation, a $25, 000 gift from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, was made in 2013. At the time, Attorney General Pam Bondi was considering whether to investigate fraud allegations against Trump University. She decided not to pursue the case. Earlier this year, The Washington Post and a liberal watchdog group raised new questions about the    gift. The watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, filed a complaint with the IRS  —   noting that, as a registered nonprofit, the Trump Foundation was not allowed to make political donations. The Post reported another error, which had the effect of obscuring the political gift from the IRS. In that year's tax filings, The Post reported, the Trump Foundation did not notify the IRS of this political donation. Instead, Trump's foundation listed a donation  —   also for $25, 000  —   to a Kansas charity with a name similar to that of Bondi's political group. In fact, Trump's foundation had not given the Kansas group any money. The prohibited gift was, in effect, replaced with an   but nonexistent donation. Trump's business said it was unaware of any of these mistakes until March, when it heard from the watchdog group and The Post. On Thursday, Jeffrey McConney  —   senior vice president and controller at the Trump Organization  —   said that after being notified, Trump filed paperwork informing the IRS of the political gift and paid an excise tax equal to 10 percent of its value. McConney said that Trump had also personally reimbursed the Trump Foundation for $25, 000, covering the full value of the improper gift. McConney blamed a series of mistakes, all of them unintentional. McConney said there had been no attempt to deceive. ”It was just an honest mistake,” McConney said. He added: ”It wasn't done intentionally to hide a political donation, it was just an error.” McConney said that he believed Trump had now done everything necessary to rectify the error. ”We've done what [we] were instructed to do,” he said.   [Inside The Post's search for evidence that Trump gives his own money to charity]   Trump started the Donald J. Trump Foundation in the late 1980s, to give away proceeds from his book, ”The Art of the Deal.” He remains the foundation's president, but  —   in recent years  —   Trump has stopped putting his own money into its coffers. Tax records show no gifts from Trump himself to the foundation since 1988; it has instead received donations from a smattering of Trump's friends and business associates.      Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi praised Republican presidential nominee Trump at the Republican National Convention. Bondi said foe Clinton's security clearance deserved to be taken away. (The Washington Post)   The Trump Foundation has no paid staff and relatively little money for a superwealthy man's personal charity: At the end of 2014, it had $1. 3 million in the bank. The foundation's giving is small and scattershot, with its gifts often sent to people whom Trump knows, or charities that hold their galas at his properties in NY and Florida. In this case, Trump staffers said that a series of unusual  —   and unrelated  —   errors by people working for Trump had led to both the improper donation and to the omission of that donation from the foundation's tax filings. The sequence began when Bondi herself solicited a donation from Trump. That solicitation was reported this year by the Associated Press. That request came as Bondi was considering allegations that Trump University  —   a real estate seminar business  —   had defrauded customers in Florida. Trump decided to give to the group connected to Bondi, called ”And Justice for All.” Then, a request for a check was sent to an   clerk at Trump's headquarters. This clerk was empowered to cut checks from both Trump's personal account and from the Trump Foundation. In most cases, political contributions were paid out of Trump's own account. But, in this case, that didn't happen. In March, Trump's chief financial officer told The Post that a mistake occurred when an accounting clerk  —   following office protocol  —   looked in a book that contained a list of all official charities. The clerk's standing order from Trump was that, if the payee was listed in this book of charities, the check should be paid from the Trump Foundation, not from Trump's own account. The clerk found a group called ”And Justice for All” listed in the book. The clerk cut the check from the Trump Foundation. But that was wrong. Trump's chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, told The Post that the charity in the book was actually from Utah, and unconnected to Bondi. If the clerk had known that the check was meant for a political group, Weisselberg said, “we would have taken it out of [Trump's] own personal account. ” After that, a check from the foundation went out. It did not go to Utah but to Bondi's group in Florida, and was deposited. Then, when the Trump Foundation sent in its tax filings that year, it compounded the original error by leaving out any mention of a political gift. When the IRS form asked if the Trump Foundation had spent money for political purposes that year, the foundation wrote ”No.”    A section of the Trump Foundation's 2013 tax filing, in which the foundation said it had not engaged in political activity. In fact, it had sent a check to a political group in Florida, in violation of IRS rules.  Then, the Trump Foundation told the IRS about a gift that did not exist. The foundation told the IRS that it had given $25, 000 to a third group, a charity in Kansas with a similar name, ”Justice for All.” In fact, the Trump Foundation had not actually sent the Kansas group any money. This new, incorrect listing had the effect of camouflaging the prohibited gift. Trump's CFO said that the listing of the Kansas group was another mistake, made by the foundation's accountants.    An excerpt from the 2013 tax filings of the Donald J. Trump Foundation. The $25, 000 gift to ”Justice for All” did not exist. It took the place of a real $25, 000 gift that had violated IRS rules, because it went to a campaign group in Florida. The name of the group that got the prohibited gift: ”And Justice for All.”  The Post asked McConney, the Trump Organization controller, for a copy of the IRS form that Trump had filed along with his $2, 500 penalty tax. McConney said he would check to see if it could be released. The IRS declined to comment about the situation. But on Thursday, the liberal watchdog group said that the Trump Foundation needs to do more that it has. Under IRS rules, it appears that the Trump Foundation must seek to get the money back from the political group. Although Trump has apparently reimbursed the foundation, ”that's not the same,” said Jordan Libowitz, of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. ”It's about getting the money back from the organization that wasn't allowed to have it in the first place.” So far, that hasn't happened. In fact, the treasurer of Bondi's political group said that she had actually tried to send the money back, without success. ”I wrote a check, sent it via FedEx. I received a call from the Trump Foundation, saying that they had declined to accept the refund,” said Nancy Watkins in an interview with The Post. She said this had happened in the spring, after she learned that the Trump Foundation was not allowed to make political gifts. Watkins said she was told, ”Mr. Trump had reimbursed the foundation with a personal check. And that was the end of it.”"
143549,214891,Hispanic supporters flee Trump's campaign after fiery immigration speech,Washington Post,Aaron Blake,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160902000145/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/01/hispanic-supporters-flee-donald-trumps-campaign-after-fiery-immigration-speech/
","         Trump's meeting with his Hispanic advisory council a couple of weeks ago left its members so excited that some even told reporters that Trump was about to significantly soften his approach to illegal immigration and maybe even embrace a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants. Those advisers got a reality check Wednesday night, when Trump gave arguably his toughest speech on illegal immigration yet  —   promising a   crackdown and saying that every undocumented immigrant is subject to deportation. Now some of these Trump advisers, along with leading Hispanic Republicans who had been giving Trump a second look over the last two weeks, are renouncing him  —   and there are signs many more may follow.   [More than 6 million immigrants could be deported under latest Trump plan]   Jacob Monty, a   immigration attorney who is a third generation Mexican American and a longtime Republican, has now resigned from Trump's advisory council and withdrawn his support for Trump. In June, as Trump became the presumptive nominee, Monty wrote a column in the Houston Chronicle headlined: “A Latino's case for Trump. ” Monty said that he backed Trump  —   and started to help raise money for him  —   before he had fully firmed up his immigration stances. But Monty believed that a businessman would approach immigration from a business standpoint. Monty attended the Aug. 20 meeting at Trump Tower and said he was impressed that Trump talked about what to do with undocumented immigrants who have contributed to American society for years or decades. “He asked all of the right questions. He said all of the right things,” Monty said. “He brought it up.   …     By bringing it up, it told me that he was prepared to talk about it. That was music to my ears, for sure. ” Monty also thought Trump's remarks during a visit with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto on Wednesday afternoon struck just the right tone. Monty agreed to go onto cable news shows and defend Trump, believing that the candidate had truly pivoted on this key issue. Then Trump took the stage in Phoenix. “The speech was just an utter disappointment,” Monty said in an interview on Thursday. He added in a Facebook post: “Tonight he was not a Republican but a populist, modern day Father [Charles] Coughlin who demonized immigrants. ” “I don't want to be a prop like the Mexican president,” Monty said in the interview. “We were out there defending him. And then to be just lied to like that  —   it doesn't feel good. It's not okay. ” Monty wasn't the only member of the advisory council to bolt. According to Politico, Texas pastor Ramiro Peña sent the Trump campaign an email saying the council basically amounted to a ”scam.” ”I am so sorry but I believe Mr. Trump lost the election tonight,” Peña said. ”The 'National Hispanic Advisory Council' seems to be simply for optics and I do not have the time or energy for a scam.” Another member, Massey Villarreal, told NBC Latino he was done, too. “As a compassionate conservative, I am disappointed with the immigration speech,” Villarreal said. “I'm going to flip, but not flop. I am no longer supporting Trump for president, but cannot with any conscience support Hillary [Clinton]. ” One Hispanic data analyst who has worked closely with Republicans, Leslie Sanchez, said she expects half the council to quit.   Hispanic leader who advises Trump camp telling me half of Trump's Hispanic advisory board is ready to resign today (15 of 30)  —   Leslie Sanchez (@LeslieSanchez) September 1, 2016   Other Hispanics who have gone to bat for Trump were disheartened. Alfonso Aguilar, the head of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles who has alternately been against Trump and then promoted his campaign as a surrogate, said he was finished with the Republicans nominee. ”I thought that we could work with him and the campaign to move him to the center on immigration, and the initial response was very good,” Aguilar said Thursday morning on CNN. ”And then we heard yesterday, and I was totally disappointed  —   not surprised, but disappointed  —   and slightly misled, because he gave the impression and the campaign gave the impression, till yesterday morning, that he was going to deal with the undocumented in a compassionate way.” Aguilar said Trump's speech was a new low. ”In that speech, he's basically saying: We'll deport you or we   you,” he said. ”It's even worse than what he initially proposed.” And some Hispanics who had been keeping an open mind about Trump as he appeared to soften his rhetoric in recent weeks recoiled after the speech. Bettina Inclán, a former director of Hispanic outreach at the Republican National Committee, went from ”hopeful” after Trump's Mexico visit to disenchanted after his speech.   I think this was a great move by #Trump, good speech. Strong step in the right direction. Now, how will he follow up? #TrumpInMexico  —   Bettina Inclán (@BettinaInclan) August 31, 2016     ughhh. ... I was so hopeful after the #TrumpInMexico trip. Please tell me this speech gets a bit better, give me something to work with Trump  —   Bettina Inclán (@BettinaInclan) September 1, 2016   Artemio Muniz, the chairman of the Texas Federation of Hispanic Republicans who has been a Trump skeptic but was willing to give him a chance on immigration, said Trump is doubling down on a bad strategy. ”I was not sure and I was going to leave my slate blank, but at this point, with what I heard last night, I can't support Trump,” Muniz said on CNN. ”I can't sell the product that he's trying to give to the Hispanic community.” Certainly, surrogates and advisers bolting from the campaign doesn't tell the whole tale. But the growing exodus suggests that the Hispanics watching Trump's moves on immigration the closest now feel betrayed, misled and alienated. And if that extends to   Hispanics writ large, that's very bad for Trump."

","     Penn State plans to commemorate the 50th anniversary of disgraced former coach Joe Paterno's first game as head of the Nittany Lions during its Sept. 17 outing against Temple. The university made the announcement on Thursday when it posted the full list of its 2016 season promotions. The school didn't say exactly what it plans to do to commemorate Paterno's first game, instead noting, in general, that some “activities during the game will take place” in its announcement. Paterno's first game as head coach occurred on Sept. 17, 1966, when Penn State beat Maryland,  ; but Paterno's legacy of complacency was exhibited later in his career when assistant coach Jerry Sandusky sexually assaulted multiple young boys. Although it is unclear when Paterno became aware of Sandusky's activity, it's highly likely that he knew, an accusation that was confirmed in a report that came out in July.   [New court documents suggest others at Penn State knew of Jerry Sandusky abuse]   Sandusky, who was convicted of sexually abusing 10 boys, was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison. Paterno, meanwhile, who died of lung cancer in 2012, was fired in 2011, days after news of the scandal broke. Paterno instantly went from hero to hated man in the eyes of many, resulting in a statue of him that stood in front of Penn State's Beaver Stadium being removed. Perhaps in an attempt to distract from the giant elephant in the room on the promotion schedule, the university listed Paterno's commemoration among four other events planned for the day, including activities to honor community heroes and raise awareness for pediatric cancer.

","     Last fall, the Navy Department had a controversial disciplinary case before it: Maj. Jason C. Brezler had been asked by Marine colleagues to submit all the information he had about an influential Afghan police chief suspected of abusing children. Brezler sent a classified document in response over an unclassified Yahoo email server, and he   the mistake soon after. But the Marine Corps recommended that he be discharged for mishandling classified material. The Navy Department, which oversees the Marine Corps, had the ability to uphold or overturn the decision. However, rather than just looking at the merits of the case, Navy officials also assessed that holding new hearings on the case would renew attention on the scandal surrounding child sex abuse in Afghanistan, according to military documents newly disclosed in federal court.   [Afghanistan sees rise in ‘dancing boys' exploitation]   The documents, filed Tuesday in a lawsuit by Brezler against the Navy Department and Marine Corps, also show that Marine and Navy officials in Afghanistan were aware in 2012 of allegations of abuse against children by the Afghan police chief but that the chief was allowed to keep his position in Helmand province anyway. This became a major issue after a teenage boy who worked for the chief  —   and allegedly was abused by him  —   opened fire on a U. S. base Aug. 10, 2012, killing three Marines and badly wounding a fourth. The   legal review, written last October by Lt. Cmdr. Nicholas Kassotis for Vice Adm. James W. Crawford III, the judge advocate general of the Navy, recommended that the Marine Corps' actions against Brezler be upheld. Calling for a new administrative review, known as a Board of Inquiry, would delay actions in the case another six to nine months and possibly increase attention on the case, “especially in the aftermath of significant media attention to the allegations regarding the practice of keeping personal sex slaves in Afghanistan,” Kassotis wrote. A month later in November, acting assistant Navy secretary Scott Lutterloh upheld the Marine Corps' decision.   [Family of slain Marine sues Marine Corps, alleging coverup]   Brezler's case has drawn new attention in recent months as critics of presidential candidate Clinton have compared her email controversy to Brezler's, noting that the officer's military career is on the brink of being over. He sued the Marine Corps and Navy Department in 2014, saying that he was a victim of reprisal for discussing his case with a member of Congress, and it has languished in court since. Brezler wants to block his dismissal, which is now on hold.    Maj. Jason C. Brezler, right, is shown as a captain serving with the 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines in Afghanistan. (Marine Corps photo)  Navy and Marine Corps officials declined to discuss the case or the new documents filed in it, citing the pending litigation. A spokesman for the Justice Department, which is handling the lawsuit for the government, also declined to comment. The Navy Department's observation about Brezler's case was made as another U. S. service member's career was in jeopardy because of his response to alleged child sex abuse in Afghanistan. In that instance, Army Sgt. 1st Class Charles Martland made headlines after the Army decided last year to involuntarily separate him from the service because of a reprimand he had received for hitting an Afghan Local Police (ALP) official in 2011 after the man laughed about kidnapping and raping a teenage boy. The Army overturned its decision in April and allowed Martland, a Green Beret, to stay in the military after Rep. Duncan D. Hunter ( .) intervened. The Martland case opened a dialogue in which numerous veterans of the war in Afghanistan said they were told to ignore instances of child sex abuse by their Afghan colleagues. The Defense Department's inspector general then opened an investigation into the sexual assault reports and how they were handled by U. S. military officials who knew about them.   [Pentagon watchdog to investigate allegations of Afghan child abuse]   Brezler's attorney, Michael J. Bowe, said Wednesday in an email that his client is entitled to a “real review” of his case  —   “not a whitewash designed to avoid uncomfortable press stories about child rape by our ‘partners' in Afghanistan. “Our service members deserve better,” he added. A spokesman for Hunter, Joe Kasper, said that the Navy Department is “right to be worried about granting Brezler a new, impartial review of his case” because it “can't sustain a case based on the facts and the moral imperative” that prompted Brezler to send the warning to other Marines that landed him in legal trouble. “The Navy surely watched the Army struggle with the Martland case, and the Army was ultimately left no choice but to retain Martland,” Kasper said. “The Brezler case is no different in that, at its foundation, there's a corrupt Afghan commander that exploits children. It's something that Americans won't tolerate, and good luck to the Navy as it tries to explain that Brezler was better to keep quiet, avoiding scrutiny altogether, than attempt to save several Marines that were killed. On that aspect alone, the Navy loses. ” Acting Defense Undersecretary Brian P. McKeon, said in a letter to Hunter last month that Gen. John “Mick” Nicholson, the top U. S. commander in Afghanistan, reaffirmed in May “tactical guidance” for U. S. troops that directs them to report potential instances of sex abuse to their commanders. “General Nicholson also issued a specific human rights policy directing further education of U. S. and coalition military personnel on their responsibilities to report human rights violations,” McKeon wrote. The Marines killed by the police chief's servant were Staff Sgt. Scott Dickinson, Cpl. Richard Rivera Jr. and Lance Cpl. Gregory Buckley. A fourth Marine suffered five gunshot wounds but survived. The teenager who killed them has been identified by the Marine Corps as Ainuddin Khudairaham. He is said to have bragged about the attack afterward, boasting “I just did jihad. ”   [Killer of Marines tried and convicted in Afghanistan as a juvenile; Marine family outraged]   A   declassified copy of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) probe of Brezler's case filed this week as part of his lawsuit said that an officer in Afghanistan, Capt. Brian Donlon, sought information about Sarwar Jan because he recalled being told that he was “a bad guy who raped and tortured the people. ” The police chief and Brezler had encountered each other previously in another part of Helmand province, Now Zad district, and Brezler had helped get him removed from his job. Donlon did not open the file Brezler attached to an email sent from the USA and reported his violation, Donlon told investigators afterward. Donlon sent an email to Brezler informing him the document he sent was classified, and then both Marines reported it to their respective commanding officers. Marine officials have said that while Brezler did send a classified email to Donlon, he actually faced scrutiny from the Marine Corps because he had other classified documents illegally stored that he planned to use while writing a book. Brezler's attorney has countered that virtually no instances of inadvertently spilling classified information have led to penalties as stiff as his, and that if he had not voluntarily turned over his electronics after reporting his violation, he would not be in trouble now.

143552,214894,Watch SpaceX's rocket explode in a massive fireball,Washington Post,Christian Davenport,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160902000145/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/01/space-x-explosion-rocks-launch-pad-at-cape-canaveral/
","         As SpaceX prepared to test fire the powerful engines of its Falcon 9 rocket, an explosion rocked its launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Thursday morning, blowing up the rocket, making it the second the company has lost in a fireball in just over a year. There were no humans on board, and no one was hurt. But the massive explosion could be felt for miles and a plume of dark, thick smoke hung over the coastline as emergency officials scrambled to assess the damage. The accident came at a pivotal moment for SpaceX, the upstart company founded by Elon Musk that has for years been flying commercial satellites to orbit and cargo to the International Space Station for NASA. Along with Boeing, SpaceX is now preparing to ferry astronauts for the first time to the station under a contract with NASA. The mission was slated to take place as soon as next year, but some officials say Thursday's explosion is likely to prompt new scrutiny. The explosion came on the same day a government watchdog reported that human flights to the station could be delayed because of technical issues with the companies' spacecraft designs.   [All the vehicles that will take you to space]   Last year, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket —  which would also be used to fly astronauts —  blew up a couple minutes after liftoff during a cargo mission. “This will always raise questions and possible delays, and certainly people redoubling their efforts on safety,” said Lori Garver, the former deputy NASA administrator.  The explosion occurred at 9:07 a. m. as SpaceX was preparing to test fire the rocket's engines ahead of the launch of a commercial satellite, reportedly valued at $195 million, that had been scheduled for early Saturday morning. The Falcon 9, towering some 230 feet high atop Launch Complex 40, was being fueled, when a fireball ignited around the upper stage oxygen tank, Musk said on Twitter. It was unclear what caused the mishap. Video of the incident shows a series of ignitions that engulfed the launch pad in flames.   [What the SpaceX rocket explosion means for NASA and human spaceflight]   In a statement issued Thursday afternoon, NASA officials said they ”remain confident in our commercial partners and firmly stand behind the successful 21st century launch complex that NASA, other federal agencies, and U. S. commercial companies are building on Florida's Space Coast.” Musk, the billionaire tech entrepreneur who also runs Tesla Motors, has laid out huge aspirations for his space company on an incredibly ambitious timeline. He plans to launch an uncrewed spacecraft in 2018 that would land on the surface of Mars, a planet he intends to colonize. At a space conference next month, he is scheduled to provide further details on how the company plans to get humans there by as early as 2025. The company also hopes to launch by the end of the year the Falcon Heavy, a much more powerful rocket than the one that exploded Thursday. And it plans to fly for the first time one of the rockets it had recovered earlier this year in a landing. But now SpaceX will be temporarily grounded while the investigation begins into what caused the explosion and repairs begin on the launch pad. After the explosion last June, SpaceX recovered quickly, returning to flight six months later. On that launch, it pulled off the first of its rocket landings. In an interview in June, Musk said that as it works to get to Mars, “we're going to make mistakes along the way. ” The company has enjoyed tremendous support from people inspired by its successes, but he said that“when we occasionally fall down, we want their support. . . Support us when the chips are down. Fair weather friends are easy to come by. But the ones that really matter are the ones that support you when the chips are down. ”   [Elon Musk provides new details on his ‘mind blowing' mission to Mars]   This year, the SpaceX successfully launched several more rockets, as it worked to churn through its growing backlog. And SpaceX was getting its momentum back, restoring confidence not just in the company, but in the notion that private companies, and not just governments, were capable of safely ferrying passengers to space. Garver, the former NASA deputy administrator, said that after NASA's setbacks, the country “continued to persevere, and I think in this case they will as well. ” She pointed out that NASA hired two companies —  SpaceX and Boeing —  to fly astronauts to the station so that it would have a backup in case something went wrong. “We were always aware that both companies could see setbacks,” she said.   [SpaceX says it will fly a spacecraft to Mars as soon as 2018]   Separately on Thursday, NASA's Inspector General released a report that said NASA's “commercial crew” program to outsource human flights to the space station “continues to face multiple challenges,” this time because of concerns with the companies' spacecraft designs. The IG said the issues “will likely delay the first routine flight carrying NASA astronauts to the ISS until late 2018  —   more than 3 years after NASA's original 2015 goal. ” Given the delays, the report said that NASA has had to extend its contract with Russia, which currently flies U. S. astronauts to the station, through 2018 at an additional cost of $490 million. John Logsdon, the former director at George Washington University's Space Policy Institute, said it was too early to say what the fallout of the explosion would be “because we don't know what happened or why it happened and how long it's going to be before they launch again. ” No matter what the cause, “it is certainly unfortunate for the broader future plans for SpaceX,” he said. Some in the space industry said they thought SpaceX could recover quickly, especially if the problem was not with the rocket.   [That SpaceX explosion blew up one of Facebook's most ambitious projects]   “We're disappointed by what happened,” said Eric Stallmer, the president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation. “But we're confident they'll find the root of the problem, and they'll be back to flying soon. ” In a statement, Sen. Bill Nelson ( .) said: “As we continue to push the frontiers of space, there will be both triumphs and setbacks. But at the end of the day, I'm confident that our commercial space industry will be very successful. ” The satellite that SpaceX was planning to launch Saturday was the   which would have been used in Facebook's first attempt to provide the Internet to rural areas from space.

I always called her “Nonna. ” Our age difference and profoundly contrasting values and way of thinking did not prevent us from developing a strong bond and a relationship punctuated by mischievous games and moments of tenderness and humor. We were amused by our differences. “You know, I was still young when you were born,” she told me a few weeks before she died. “It's a little like we grew up together. ” At a lunch table a few months earlier in Milan, I learned from my mother, her daughter, that Nonna, 85, was suffering from incurable liver cancer. Years before, she had already survived two bouts of breast cancer. Nonna would tell me time and time again that the news of my birth had given her the strength to fight. When I learned that she was sick again, I had just landed in Italy, where I would be for only three days before flying back to NY.    Marisa Vesco eats breakfast in her bed. (Gaia  )     Marisa Vesco eats ice cream in her bed. (Gaia  )  Even more heartbreaking than the fear of saying goodbye to her was the fact that my grandmother did not know how sick she was. My mother and aunt believed she could not bear the thought of a third bout with cancer, this time affecting her liver. Nonna was told by family members that her liver was ill. No one ever mentioned the word “cancer. ” Because of this, one question haunted us until the day she died: Did we have the right to know the truth about her condition when she did not? Nonna spent most of her last months at home, surrounded by family. She reconciled with the idea of death and said she could slowly feel it coming. Doctors felt that surgery and chemotherapy would be pointless. In the midst of all this, I realized that my mother was losing her mother. After moving back to Italy for a few months, I witnessed the range of my mother's emotions and the energy she devoted to the time they had left together. Nonna's world shrank to a few walls and fewer streets. In this narrow existence, every detail and daily act took on deeper meaning. One of the things my mother treasured most was giving her mother a bath. She did not hesitate to touch her old body, and she did not want others to do it on her behalf.

As I experienced those precious moments, I imagined myself at an older age and thought about how time changes one's perspective on being a woman.

(Gaia  )  If you spoke with people in Nonna's town, they would say she never left the house without being enveloped in a cloud of perfume, her white hair perfectly coiffed and her face tinged with makeup. I was surprised by the way she confronted being ill without losing her femininity. She was able to poke fun at herself. More than once she asked me, “Am I going to end up on Vogue or Marie Claire?” On Oct. 11, 2015, the day Nonna died in Biella, Italy, I was across the world in Brooklyn, N. Y. I had spent five months with her, celebrating her life instead of mourning her death. I remember taking a walk through the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn and staring for a while at kids competing in a race. I was unable to come to terms with the fact she was no longer a part of the world around me. I struggled with the concept of death and the abstract emotion we call grief. I found peace only when I returned to Italy to spread Nonna's ashes. My family and I walked to Nonna's favorite place in the mountains not far from Cossato in northwestern Italy, the town in which she had grown up. Her ashes felt heavy in my hands. I threw them far up into the air, and they fell all over the grass, and all over me. My mother, brother and aunt did the same, again and again. In the end, we were covered in Nonna's ashes and so was the field around us. Months later, my mother sent me a photograph of that field. It was completely covered in flowers.    Marisa Vesco's ashes are spread by her nephew Luca Squarci at her favorite location where she grew up near Cossato, Italy. (Gaia  ) "
143584,214934,How Anthony Weinerâ€™s risque messages shaped our revenge-porn laws,Washington Post,Sarah Jeong,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160904003253/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/09/01/how-anthony-weiners-risque-messages-shaped-our-revenge-porn-laws/
","     In the aftermath of Anthony Weiner s latest sext scandal, he found a surprising ally:Â Dan Savage. In a Monday interview, the sex columnist said that Weiner should be seen as  the victim of revenge porn, ? aÂ malicious act in which sexual photographs are shared without the consent of the subject, usually to humiliate or harm. Revenge porn (more accurately called involuntary or nonconsensual pornography) is now illegal in several states and, thanks to a bill that is currently in front of Congress, may soon be a federal crime. But when those laws were being crafted just a few years ago, Weiner was a frequently touted example of what revenge porn isn t.   [Opinion: Our gawking at Anthony Weiner reveals something ugly about us]   This was initially a debate over how broadly to write the    statutes. Arizona s statute was so broad that when the American Civil Liberties Union sued over it, and a court of law suspended its enforcement. California s first try at criminalizing revenge porn was too narrow, because it excluded selfies  ” which are, according to some estimates, actually the bulk of all involuntary pornography. But one point of contention that everyone kept looping back to was around one issue: newsworthiness. If the statutes did not create an exception for newsworthy material, reporters and publishers might become criminally liable for reprinting the iconic  Napalm Girl ? photo from the Vietnam War, the incriminating pictures from Abu Ghraib, or, Â yes, the infamous tweet that Anthony Weiner sent out on May 27, 2011. Weiner s genitals areÂ not really an attractive rallying cry for free speech activism, but theyÂ kept coming up during these policy debates. After all, it would be absurd to imprison a tabloid reporter for screencapping the tweet that Weiner himself had sent out. And it wasn t just the tabloids: The picture made it onto   TV shows, and through them, into the Sundance Grand Jury   documentary  Weiner. ? Weiner s penis used to be the premier example of what isn t revenge porn, because it was newsworthy  ” not exactly the most   type of news, but it was still a matter of public concern. And besides, a USA congressman s errant tweet didn t look anything like a jerk humiliating their  .  But that was multiple scandals ago. In this latest iteration, his sexting partner betrayed his trust, and sexual photographs sent privately were published with the apparent aim of humiliating him. Seen through the narrowest of lenses, it seems as ifÂ the standard  revenge porn ? story arc  ” but it s not.  A critical distinction has to be made between Weiner and such victims asÂ Jennifer Lawrence, Leslie Jones, and countless unnamed,   people whose privacy was violated without any other context besides malice. Weiner s photos exist in a context, one in which the second photo, and the third, and the fourth, and so on are all news  ” news that Anthony Weiner is still doing the thing that Anthony Weiner is most famous for. Weiner s photos were newsworthy then, and continue to be newsworthy now. But just because something s legal doesn t mean it s a good thing. There s something darkly tragic about all of this. Each successive Weiner scandal inherits newsworthiness from the last one. The man seems intent on never leaving the public eye. Yet he can t seem to stop sending pictures of himself to strangers, the media can t seem to stop publishing them, and the public can t seem to stop consuming them. The cycle will never end.  Adding to the surreal nature of it all, Weiner s photographs aren t actually just being used against him, but also to humiliate his wife Huma Abedin, and by proxy, presidential nominee Clinton. Even if Weiner has no one to blame for all of this but himself, he is not the only one who has to bear the brunt of the attack.  Maybe Weiner isn t a   victim, but the very same social attitudes that make revenge porn such a powerful crime are what drive our unrelenting fascination with his penis.  I ve been thinking a lot about a moment in the  Weiner ? documentary, when the documentarian asks Abedin how she is doing, and she replies,  Like living in a nightmare. ? Right now, we are all participants in someone else s nightmare. When the news broke, my first thought was,  What is wrong with that man? ? Now my predominant thought is,  What is wrong with us? ?"
143592,214943,Stop touting the crazy hours you work. It helps no one.,Washington Post,Jena McGregor,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160904003253/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2016/09/01/stop-touting-the-crazy-hours-you-work-it-helps-no-one-2/
","     As Labor Day approaches, and a single day of rest from all the hours we Americans spend on the job is upon us, people can't seem to stop talking about the crazy hours they work. One of the   articles on the Wall Street Journal's web site last week was a piece about how 4 a. m.    a time so ungodly there's even a TED Talk about how surreal it is    has become the most productive hour for  . Trump has been endlessly knocking Clinton for sleeping (gasp!) calling out her lack of stamina as he brags about not needing much sleep and his former staffers say that vacations would ”bore and perhaps scare” the Republicans presidential nominee. And then there is Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, who said in a recent Bloomberg BusinessWeek interview that she regularly pulled all nighters when she worked at Google and can judge a startup's chances for success by whether people are working on the weekends. ”Could you work 130 hours in a week?” Mayer said, referring to the value hard work played in Google's success. ”The answer is yes, if you're strategic about when you sleep, when you shower, and how often you go to the bathroom.”   [Working more than 55 hours a week is bad for you —  in many ways]   This has got to stop. No one, no matter what the upside may be, should have to be that strategic. The idea that being   could be a black mark against a leader is preposterous. And even if a super early   time works for some people    and they're sensitive about sending out email before dawn    if you're having to get up at 4 a. m. to avoid distractions in your day, there's probably something wrong with how we're working. Americans' weekly work hours, on average, actually fall somewhere in the middle of the pack among developed nations. But four in 10 of us don't use all the vacation time we're allotted    which is far less than it is in most countries. Researchers have looked at the Bureau of Labor Statistics' American Time Use Survey and found we're literally trading sleep for work. A Gallup poll found that 50 percent of people work more than 40 hours a week, and the average, nearly 47 hours a week in 2014, has been creeping up for years. The expectation of crazy hours is strong enough that one researcher found some men pretend to work an   week, even when they don't.   [How the new overtime rules could affect flexibility on the job]   Yet research, time and time again, shows the problems with overwork    on people's health, on turnover, on absenteeism, on productivity. Studies have shown that after about 50 hours a week, productivity actually decreases, and it plummets after 55 hours, leaving no detectable difference between those who work 56 hours and those who work 70    or 130, as Mayer suggested may be needed for successful startups. That's an absurd number of hours, translating into more than 18 hours a day of work, seven days a week. It's illogical, given the research. It's obviously unsustainable. And if that's how we're going to measure success in the workplace today, we're in big trouble. Some companies, of course, are looking for smart solutions. Aetna is paying workers up to $500 a year if they get 20 nights of at least seven hours of sleep in a row, using Fitbit devices to help them keep track. Boston Consulting Group has teams set aside ”predictable time off,” covering for each other so they can be available to both their clients and their families. And Amazon. com, which came under fire last year after a NY Times piece about its demanding work culture, will soon launch an experiment that sets up technical teams made up solely of   workers, earning benefits and salaries but at lesser pay. One key reason it could work: Managers of these teams will work just 30 hours a week, too. That could help prevent the ”hours creep” that typically happens when   workers, supervised by people who work much longer hours, try and limit their hours in a   work world. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)   [Amazon is piloting teams with a   workweek]   Managers, after all, are probably the biggest factor in changing our increasingly     world. If workers see people taking time off to coach their kid's soccer game, or leaving by 6 p. m. to have dinner at home, they'll feel entitled to do the same. But if they toil under someone who suggests that working on weekends is ”a huge indicator of success,” or that working 130 hours a week is possible, they may feel compelled to emulate them. Yes, success comes from hard work. And yes, CEOs paid millions of dollars or early startup employees who stand to reap huge rewards may choose to work   weeks. Entrepreneurs who can kick off at 3 p. m. if they start at 4 a. m. and aren't expected to show their face until rush hour starts may love their early morning routines. But they should be mindful that while oddball hours or absurdly long slogs at the desk may work for them, they also set an unattainable standard for many others.      ”There's no reason you are special because you happen to have this job,” the Unilever CEO tells The Post.

143618,214973,One dietitianâ€™s secret weapon for healthy eating,Washington Post,Jae Berman,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160905002504/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/one-dietitians-secret-weapon-for-healthy-eating-batch-cooking/2016/08/31/cd2f19ea-697b-11e6-8225-fbb8a6fc65bc_story.html
"," I am going to fill you in on a major secret of good nutrition: Healthier eating often has nothing to do with superfoods, metabolism or the perfect balance of nutrients, but rather with being prepared. That s right  ” just like the Boy Scouts. In this case, what we need to be prepared with is food that is in line with our values and health goals. We live fast lives, and most of us are tight on time. Often we don t eat right not because we don t think we need to or because we refuse to eat vegetables, but rather because we come home tired and hungry to an empty fridge. So we order something quick  ” and probably unhealthy  ” because it is easy and tasty. How can you prepare for this? The answer is batch cooking  ” cooking enough food at one time so you make two or three meals  worth of leftovers. You always have nutritious, homemade food on hand. Life gets easier, and your body gets healthier. It s truly that simple.   [ ? Healthy  sweeteners,   quinoa and other nutrition myths, debunked]  When you first start batch cooking, it will seem to take a lot of time, because you are prepping and cooking so much at once. However, the time you will save during the days that follow is tremendous. If you roast two to four sheets of vegetables on Sundays, you ve got those veggies all week. Stored in a container in your fridge, they can be eaten cold or reheated in seconds. Same with protein: Cook 10 chicken breasts, make a dozen burgers and   a dozen eggs, and you are set for protein when you walk in the door after a long day. This goes for starches as well. Make a big pot of quinoa, rice, beans, you name it, and daily portions are just waiting to be reheated. And don t forget to make use of your freezer, the ultimate weapon against food going bad. You can freeze cooked grains such as rice, bread and pasta, as well as cooked proteins and even vegetables. As you learn to master freezing foods and refrigerating them in airtight containers, you might be able to make enough in one   session to last as long as two weeks.   To be sure, a major problem many people have with batch cooking is they don t think they re getting enough variety in their meals. Repeating the same foods during the week can be boring. The solution is using spices, herbs and condiments to add variety. Protein one night can be made with salsa, cilantro and chilies; the next night, add olives, vinegar and rosemary; for lunch, add ketchup, mustard and pickles.  [Nine ways to tighten your family s food budget without skimping on nutrition]  Besides the batches of vegetables, proteins and grains mentioned above, here are some meal ideas to get you started: "

","   Trump spoke Friday with Taiwan's president, a major departure from decades of U. S. policy in Asia and a breach of diplomatic protocol with ramifications for the incoming president's relations with China. The call is the first known contact between a U. S. president or   with a Taiwanese leader since before the USA broke diplomatic relations with the island in 1979. China considers Taiwan a province, and news of the official outreach by Trump is likely to infuriate the regional military and economic power. The exchange is one of a string of unorthodox conversations with foreign leaders that Trump has held since his election. It comes at a particularly tense time between China and Taiwan, which earlier this year elected a president, Tsai   who has refused to accept the notion of a unified China under Beijing's rule. Her election angered Beijing to the point of cutting off all official communication with the island government. It is not clear whether Trump intends a more formal shift in U. S. relations with Taiwan or China. On the call, Trump and Tsai congratulated each other on winning their elections, a statement from Trump's transition office said.       Trump talks with workers during a visit to the Carrier factory on Dec. 1 in Indianapolis. (Jabin   Washington Post)  “During the discussion, they noted the close economic, political, and security ties . . . between Taiwan and the USA,” a statement from Trump's transition office said.  A spokeswoman for Taiwan in the USA said she could not immediately confirm that the conversation took place and said she was seeking guidance from Taiwan. The conversation was first reported by the Financial Times and the Taipei Times. The   tweeted out Friday evening, “The president of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. ” The USA has pursued what it calls a “One China” policy since 1972, when   Richard M. Nixon visited China. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter recognized Beijing as the only government of both mainland China and Taiwan, and Washington closed its embassy in Taiwan a year later. China guards the structures of its formal relationship with the USA very carefully  —   especially the founding document that established the One China policy. U. S. officials typically tiptoe around any mention of Taiwan or the Chinese goal of full reunification. “This phone call calls into question whether or not Trump adheres to the basic foundation of the U. S.  relationship,” said Evan Medeiros, a former top China adviser to Obama who is now an adviser at the  Eurasia Group. “This action guarantees that U. S.  relations under Trump will get off to a very rocky start. ” Trump's growing team of   and   advisers includes several people who have been strong supporters of Taiwan in Republican administrations. They include Stephen Yates, deputy national security adviser under Vice President Richard B. Cheney, who was reported to be visiting Taiwan when the call occurred. Trump apparently considered hotel investments in Taiwan earlier this year. The mayor of Taoyuan said last month that a representative from the Trump Organization had visited and was interested in constructing hotels in the northwestern Taiwanese city, according to China Times. Trump has said he will separate himself from his businesses before he is inaugurated. In recent years, in the face of Taiwan's waning economic power and decreasing international recognition as a separate entity from mainland China, Taiwanese diplomatic representatives in Washington have been trying to raise their stature. They have courted government officials and journalists with Taiwanese film screenings, expensive soirees and other cultural events around town.  For years it has looked like a losing battle. But the Trump call could constitute a major and unexpected coup for Taiwan's new administration by showing the island's continued relevance. Michael J. Green, a senior Asia adviser to President George W. Bush, said the call will not necessarily lead to lasting bad blood with China. “Taiwan is a very good friend, and it is good to let the world know that,” Green said, adding, “The  's phone call may have been unconventional, but it's not completely unprecedented. ” President Ronald Reagan infuriated the Chinese by inviting a Taiwanese delegation to his inaugural ball, and his administration included a   tussle over whether to “   Taiwan,” Green said. Bush caused a kerfuffle when he suggested the USA might defend Taiwan militarily, but that, too, blew over, Green noted. Earlier Friday, Trump reportedly extended an invitation for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to visit the USA next year. That what would mark a startling turnabout for a foreign leader who famously called Obama a “son of a whore. ” Trump transition officials confirmed the Duterte call but did not say whether Trump had issued the invitation. Perhaps not surprisingly, the   Republican has infused the usually banal routine of congratulatory calls from foreign leaders with drama. Most of the more than 50 calls held by Trump or Vice   Pence came without the knowledge or guidance of the State Department. That means no talking points about issues of particular importance  —   or land mines to avoid. “We stand by to assist and facilitate and support communication that the transition team is having with foreign leaders,” State Department spokesman John Kirby said Friday. The calls have appeared haphazard and out of order  —   Russia and Ireland before close ally Britain, for example  —   and the conversations have a casual tone that the British press sniffed is  “ . ” Some calls, as described by Trump aides or the other country, have elicited a raised eyebrow or two. There was Trump's offhand suggestion to British Prime Minister Theresa May to “let me know” if she happened to be coming to town. A state visit typically takes months of planning and involves a numbing amount of diplomatic protocol of the    variety. And there was the conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin in which the two agreed, according to the Kremlin, “on the absolutely unsatisfactory state of bilateral relations” and committed to “normalize” the relationship. The USA and Russia maintain cordial official ties  —   StateSecretary John F. Kerry met with the Russian foreign minister Friday  —   but both countries have accused the other of meddling. Some Trump communications have yielded questions and worries among U. S. diplomats and foreign powers, most notably a call Wednesday between Trump and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. A vivid account of the conversation released by Pakistan has Trump heaping praise on Sharif as “a terrific guy” and Pakistanis as “one of the most intelligent people. ” The USA  —   and Trump when he was a candidate  —   have said Pakistan has not done enough to combat terrorism, and the   country would be heavily affected by Trump's proposed restrictions on Muslim immigration. Nonetheless, when Sharif invited him to visit Pakistan, Trump replied that he would “love to come to a fantastic country, fantastic place of fantastic people,” the Pakistani statement said. A Trump statement came with no such color, but transition officials did not disavow the quotes. Most disturbing to diplomats in the USA and elsewhere was the Pakistani account of Trump pledging partnership that could suggest favoritism in Pakistan's eternal  —   and nuclear armed  —   rivalry with India. Trump told Sharif he would “play any role you want me to play to address and find solutions to the country's problems,” according to the Pakistani account. China, North Korea and Russia, as well as India, are likely to take note of that, diplomats said. “The one thing you learn is, you've got to be very careful what you say because everything you say or tweet matters,” said William Danvers, a former senior official in the Obama State Department, Pentagon and CIA. “You have a grace period when you're president and you deserve it, but it's mostly a domestic grace period,” Danvers said. “It's not as if Kim Jong Un is going to say, ‘Oh you just became president, so I'll hold off on my missile test.' It kind of makes us look like we don't know what we're doing. ” As for Duterte, who had announced a public “breakup” with the USA before the election, the State Department's Kirby said little. “I don't know of any specific support that was provided for that call,” he said. “Our job is to make sure they know we are a ready resource. How they make decisions and how they conduct dialogue and communication with foreign leaders is really for them to decide. ” Trump communications director Jason Miller told reporters Friday that the calls are not off the cuff. Trump and Pence “are briefed in advance of their calls, obviously working with the teams that we have put together,” Miller said before news of the Duterte call had broken. White House press secretary Josh Earnest urged Trump to take advantage of diplomatic   as he contacts foreign leaders ahead of his inauguration in January. “I'm confident that as   Trump takes office, those same State Department employees will stand ready to offer him advice as he conducts the business of the USA overseas,” Earnest said. “Hopefully he'll take it. ” Trump's outreach to Duterte could echo Obama's election pledge to try to talk to adversaries, although Trump has denounced Obama's main claims to success in that effort  —   openings to Iran and Cuba. Obama presided over a reversal of the U. S. relationship with the Philippines and its new leader. Duterte's denunciations of the longtime alliance between the two nations and personal insults of Obama prompted the president to cancel a planned meeting with Duterte in China in September.  Duterte has said U. S. troops should leave his country within two years. He also cozied up to Chinese President Xi Jinping, alarming the Obama administration, which had backed the Philippines' challenge at an international tribunal last summer over China's maritime claims in waters used by Filipino fishermen. The tribunal ruled against China, but Duterte has signaled a willingness to negotiate a deal with Beijing that could allow the Chinese navy to remain in control of the region.

145470,217353,Trump supporters aggressively challenge Stein recount efforts in three states,Washington Post,Jerry Markon,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161203001010/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-supporters-aggressively-challenge-stein-recount-efforts-in-three-states/2016/12/02/bfc4d256-b8bb-11e6-959c-172c82123976_story.html
"," Supporters of   Trump are moving aggressively to challenge Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein's push for a recount in three states, filing legal challenges and criticizing the effort as quixotic and  . Trump and his backers have filed challenges the past two days in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which were critical to Trump's surprise victory last month because they punctured the   blue wall of states expected to carry Democrat Clinton to victory. Trump narrowly won the trio of states. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette (R) on Friday tweeted that Stein's request was “an expensive & a risky threat” as he announced he had filed an emergency motion with the Michigan Supreme Court to stop it.  Stein, who has raised millions of dollars from supporters to help pay for the costly recount efforts, blasted back at what she called “a politically motivated attempt by Bill Schuette to side with Trump in opposition to a fair and accountable voting system. '' She added in a statement that “citizens in Michigan and across the country of every political party have expressed their concerns around our voting system and deserve to have their votes counted. ''      Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump's Cabinet View Graphic     Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump's Cabinet  Stein has raised concerns about possible hacking or other irregularities in the vote in the three states, but has presented no evidence of malfeasance. Election officials in all three states have expressed confidence in their results, and voting rights experts have said the effort is highly unlikely to overturn the results that are sending Trump to the White House. Clinton's campaign has joined Stein's recount effort, though her team has said it does not expect the outcome of the election to change. The Clinton campaign had no immediate comment on Friday. In Wisconsin, where Trump defeated Clinton by one percentage point, a recount is underway. But Great America PAC and Stop Hillary PAC, both   groups, said Friday they had filed a legal challenge a day earlier in federal court in conjunction with a Wisconsin voter to stop the new count. Stein's team said Friday that it will fight the challenge.  “Citizens in Wisconsin and across the country have made it clear that they want a recount and deserve to see this process through to ensure integrity in the vote,” Stein attorney Matthew D. Brinckerhoff said in a statement. In Pennsylvania, where Stein has acknowledged the path to forcing a recount is more difficult but has initiated an effort to do so nonetheless, attorneys for Trump filed an objection to Stein's request in state court on Thursday. “Even with the heroic efforts by state and local elections officials involved in the recounts, as well as expeditious review by this Court, Stein's proposed process will last weeks, perhaps even months. Either way, her request puts Pennsylvania at grave risk of having not certified its Presidential electors by December 13, the deadline for doing so,” says the filing.  On Friday, the focus of the escalating battle was in Michigan, as the Board of State Canvassers deadlocked   over an objection that attorneys for Trump filed Thursday against Stein's recount request. Trump argued that Stein cannot, as the state's   finisher, claim that she is “aggrieved” by the way the vote unfolded and that there isn't enough time to complete the recount by the Dec. 13 deadline to certify Michigan's election results.     Retired U. S. Marine Corps General James Mattis has been chosen to be secretary of defense by   Trump, according to people familiar with the decision. (Jenny   Washington Post)   Because of the deadlock, the office of Michigan StateSecretary Ruth Johnson (R) said in a tweet that “the recount is expected to commence early next week, barring court action. ”  Schuette then filed his emergency motion with the Michigan Supreme Court. It was not immediately clear whether a hearing has been set. The earliest a Michigan recount could start would be next week.  Meanwhile, the   resumed his schedule of transition meetings at Manhattan's Trump Tower on Friday, bringing in two   experts on foreign policy. The   met with Robert M. Gates, who served as defense secretary under Obama and had derided Trump as “unqualified and unfit to be   ” in a September   in the Wall Street Journal. Gates spoke briefly with reporters afterward, saying he had praised Trump's selection of retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis as defense secretary, which Trump announced Thursday. “I told him I thought his selection of General Mattis to be secretary of defense was terrific, very supportive,” said Gates, who declined to answer further questions. Trump also sat down with John Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations. He was at one point considered a candidate for secretary of state, but Kellyanne Conway, one of Trump's top advisers, told Fox News on Friday that Trump has narrowed that search to four finalists. According to Conway, they are 2012 Republicans presidential nominee Mitt Romney, former NY City mayor Rudy Giuliani, retired Army Gen. David Petraeus and Sen. Bob Corker ( .) chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Opponents of Romney have waged an extraordinary public campaign against his nomination for the post and urged Trump to reward Giuliani for his loyalty during the campaign. It is unclear when Trump will make a final decision.    Alice Crites contributed to this report.  "

"," You may think you are prepared for a   world, in which political appeals to emotion count for more than statements of verifiable fact. But now it's time to cross another bridge  —   into a world without facts. Or, more precisely, where facts do not matter a whit. On live radio Wednesday morning, Scottie Nell Hughes sounded breezy as she drove a stake into the heart of knowable reality: “There's no such thing, unfortunately, anymore, of facts,” she declared on “The Diane Rehm Show” on Wednesday. Hughes, a frequent surrogate for   Trump and a paid commentator for CNN during the campaign, kept on defending that assertion at length, though not with much clarity of expression. Rehm had pressed her about Trump's recent   assertion on Twitter that he, not Clinton, would have won the popular vote if millions of immigrants had not voted illegally.     A shouting match erupted at an election postmortem session, where aides from both campaigns met to discuss the election. The Washington Post's Margaret Sullivan and Callum Borchers talk about what happened. (The Washington Post)   (The apparent gen esis of Trump's claim was Infowars. com, a site that traffics in conspiracy theories and is run by Alex Jones, who says the 2012 massacre of 20 schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn. was a   hoax.) What matters now, Hughes argued, is not whether his fraud claim is true. No, what matters is who believes it. “Mr. Trump's tweet, amongst a certain crowd, a large  —   a large part of the population, are truth. When he says that millions of people illegally voted, he has some  —   in his  —   amongst him and his supporters, and people believe they have facts to back that up. Those that do not like Mr. Trump, they say that those are lies, and there's no facts to back it up. ” Yes, it's a fact: I heard it live, as did Rehm, Politico's Glenn Thrush, and the Atlantic's James Fallows, who wrote about it, citing a recording of the show. One might be tempted, though, to dismiss it as one woman's opinion: Maybe Hughes, the political editor of RightAlerts. com, was just having a hallucinatory day. But at a   event the next evening, two other Trump surrogates echoed this sentiment. Ousted Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, speaking during an election   at Harvard University's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, blamed journalists for  —   yes  —   believing what his candidate said. “You guys took everything that Trump said so literally,” said Lewandowski, who was another   CNN hire. “The American people didn't. They understood it. They understood that sometimes  —   when you have a conversation with people, whether it's around the dinner table or at a bar  —   you're going to say things, and sometimes you don't have all the facts to back it up. ”     Hear from The Washington Post reporters who criscrossed the country to cover Donald J. Trump, Clinton and the voters who will choose one of them to be president. (Bastien   Washington Post)   Yes, Corey, but Trump is not a guy at a bar; he was the Republican nominee for president of the USA and will pretty soon be the leader of the free world, such as it is. So, how should Trump's statements during the campaign have been covered? Should reporters have added something like this in the second paragraph of every news story? “Trump probably didn't mean that he would appoint a special   a   millions of immigrants. His statements are not meant to be taken literally but rather as broad suggestions of a feeling he was experiencing on a particular day. ” There was more from the Harvard event. When CNN's Jake Tapper asked Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway about the same   claim discussed above  —   specifically, whether disseminating misinformation was “presidential”  —   it was clear that she and Hughes got the same memo. “He's the   so that's presidential behavior,” Conway said, using     reminiscent of the Nixonian “When the president does it, that means that it's not illegal. ” These surrogates' disdain for facts should not be surprising, given Trump's own casual relationship with verifiable truth. It's time to dust off your old copy of “1984 ” by George Orwell and recall this passage: “The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation. These contradictions are not accidental, nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy: they are deliberate exercises in doublethink. ” And be vigilant.  For more by Margaret Sullivan visit wapo.   "

","         There are many aspects of the economic policy of the new administration that I find misguided. But I am most troubled by what   Trump did with Carrier to hold on to an extra 700 jobs in Indiana. Ronald Reagan's response to the air traffic controllers' strike was a small act that had profound consequences. I fear in a similar way that the negotiation with Carrier is a small thing that is actually a very big thing  —   a change very much for the worse with regards to the operating assumptions of American capitalism. Market economies can operate anywhere along a continuum between two poles. I have always thought of American capitalism as dominantly rule and law based. Courts enforce contracts and property rights in ways that are largely independent of just who it is who is before them. Taxes are calculable on the basis of an arithmetic algorithm. Companies and governments buy from the cheapest bidder. Regulation follows previously promulgated rules. In the economic arena, the state's monopoly on the use of force is used to enforce contract and property rights and to enforce previously promulgated laws. Even though we know of instances of corruption, abuse of power, favoritism and selective enforcement, we take this   system for granted.  But looking around the world today or back through American history, this model is hardly a norm. Many market economies operate what might be called ad hoc or   capitalism: Economic actors assume that they have to protect their property and do their own contract enforcement. Tax collectors use discretion in assessing taxes. Companies and governments buy from their friends rather than seek   bids.  Regulators abuse their power. The state's monopoly on the use of force is used to enrich and satisfy the desires of those who control the apparatus of the state. This is the world of NY City under Tammany Hall, of Suharto's Indonesia, and of Putin's Russia. Reliance on rules and law has enormous advantages. It greatly increases predictability and reduces uncertainty. It reduces expenditures on both guarding property and seeking to appropriate property. It promotes freedom because most of the people most of the time do not take political positions with a view to gaining commercial advantage. The advantages of the rule of law are so great that I would claim that there is no country more than   as rich as the USA that does not have a strong tradition of the rule of   capitalism.  And I know of no country where the people are free where the rule of law does not largely govern market interactions.        Trump and vice   Pence have convinced air conditioning manufacturer Carrier to keep 1, 000 jobs at its Indianapolis, Ind. plant instead of moving them to Mexico. This is a major publicity score for Trump who had previously criticized Carrier and other manufacturers on the campaign trail. But putting pressure on individual businesses doesn't make for a winning long term strategy. Wonkblog's Jim Tankersley explains. (Daron   Washington Post)   What about Carrier? The   of the USA decided in a purely ad hoc basis that he wanted Carrier to remain in Indiana. He deployed some combination of carrots and sticks at his disposal to lever Carrier into doing what he wanted. Implicitly or explicitly, there must have been sticks, as press accounts suggest that the tax benefits provided offset only a small part of the savings forgone by staying in Indiana. It is not hard to see from the point of view of United Technologies, the parent of Carrier, that for a company with more than $50 billion in revenue it's surely worth $60 million to not be on the wrong side of a possibly vindictive president of the USA. It seems to me what we have just witnessed is an act of ad hoc deal capitalism and, worse yet, its celebration as a model. As with the air traffic controllers, only a negligible sliver of the economy is involved, but there is huge symbolic value. A principle is being established: It is good for the president to try to figure out what people want and lean on companies to give it to them. Predictability and procedure are less important than getting the right result at the right time. Like Hong Kong, as mainland China increasingly imposes its will, we may have taken a first step toward a kind of reverse transition from rule of law capitalism to ad hoc   capitalism. The commentary on the  's actions has emphasized its novelty, has emphasized the difficulties of scaling, and in the case of Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) has argued that the actions taken were insufficiently forceful because some workers will still be relocated to Mexico. All of this misses the point. Presidents have enormous latent power, and it is the custom of restraint in its use that is one of the important differences between us and banana republics. If its ad hoc use is licensed, the possibilities are endless. Most companies will prefer the good to the bad will of the U. S. president and his leadership team. Should that reality be levered to get them to locate where the president wants, to make contributions to the president's reelection campaign, to hire people the president wants to see hired, to do the kinds of research the president wants carried out, or to lend money to those that the president wants to see assisted?

","     Determined not to let any Trump action go unchallenged, the media has been full of comments from economists (including Larry Summers and Justin Wolfers) that Trump's intervention to save jobs at Carrier's Indiana facility is just a showman's    —   that it can't be easily replicated and will be ultimately ineffective in changing the job prospects in a country that creates and destroys a couple of million jobs every month. This is simply not the way things are done in a country that values free markets and the rule of law. Methinks they are missing the story. One of the blind spots economists have is around norms of behavior  —   the unwritten rules that are the guiderails for how people act. There was a time in America when there was an unwritten pact in the business world  —   workers were loyal to their companies and successful companies returned that loyalty by sharing some of their profits with their workers in the form of higher wages, job security and support for the local community. In some cases, this social contract was reinforced by a union contract, but it was also embraced even in   situations because there was a broad public consensus that it was the right thing to do. Business leaders conformed to the norm not only because it helped them attract good workers and customers and have clout in dealing with governmental leaders, but also because it made them feel good about themselves. Then came the 1980s, and all that began to change as American industry began to falter because of foreign competition. Consumers decide they cared more about cheaper products than socially conscious corporate behavior. And just as significantly, investors, after years of lousy returns, decided they cared more about maximizing shareholder value than they did about maximizing the social value of the enterprise they owned. So the social norm changed. A new breed of corporate executive, incented with boatloads of stock options, decided that the right thing to do was to cut costs at any price, including the economic health of their workers or their communities. Indeed, for a while, if a corporate executive didn't have an aggressive plan to shift production overseas, they were criticized by Wall Street and the business press and threatened with takeovers by what we now call “activist investors. ” Although the public never much liked the idea of closing plants and shipping jobs overseas, it no longer was socially unacceptable. Now comes Trump  —   in the public mind, a successful businessman  —   who as the new president, suddenly declares that the new norm is no longer acceptable, and he intends to do whatever he can to shame and punish companies that abandon their workers. It's one thing for a company to sustain a few days of bad headlines in the local newspaper when it decides to close a facility. It's quite another when the president of the USA is not only willing, but from a political point eager, to make a federal case out of it. Suddenly, maximizing shareholder value no longer provides the political and social inoculation that it used to. Unlike their patron saint, Adam Smith,   economists tend to ignore such shifts in social norms because they can't quantify them in the same way they can quantify trade flows or technological innovation or changes in educational attainment. And if they can't quantify something, they can't include it in their complex mathematical models, or even the simpler mental models in their heads of how the economy operates. They assume that social norms change in response to economic fundamentals rather than the other way around. Trump understands better. He knows that he and his new commerce secretary will have to engage in a few more bouts of   arm twisting before the message finally sinks in in the  . He may even have to make an example of a runaway company by sending in the tax auditors or the OSHA inspectors or cancelling a big government contract. It won't matter that, two years later, these highly publicized retaliations are thrown out by a federal judge somewhere. Most companies won't want to risk such threats to their “brands. ” They will find a way to conform to the new norm, somewhat comforted by the fact that their American competitors have been forced to do the same. Just as much as changes in the law, this is how norms of business behavior are changed. Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt understood that. So did Ronald Reagan when he fired thousands of striking air traffic controllers and set back the union movement for several decades. Obama, not so much. And here's a little secret: Privately, many of the executives will welcome the change. They chafe under the tyranny of maximizing shareholder value and they don't like being widely viewed as ruthless and selfish. In his bombastic, narcissistic,   way, Trump may have actually done them a favor.

","  CINCINNATI  —   Susan Meyer becomes giddy as she explains just how excited she is for   Trump to take office. Her tone changes at the mention of “secretary of state. ” Meyer trusts Trump, but she simply doesn't understand why he would put Mitt Romney on his shortlist to head the State Department. It's not that she doesn't like Romney; she voted for him in 2012 and considers him fully capable. But how could Trump forget the things Romney said about him during the primary? Why would he trust someone like that? “He outwardly spoke against him in a malicious way,” said Meyer, a retired teacher in her 70s who once taught students for whom English was a second language. “Is he loyal? Is he going to be loyal to the president? I would question that. ” In the three weeks since Trump won the election, he has dropped or leaned away from a number of key campaign promises, puzzling some of his supporters. Appointing a special prosecutor to investigate former rival Clinton is no longer a top priority for Trump, who sympathetically said that Clinton already “went through a lot. ” He has said he is now open to amending the Affordable Care Act instead of fully repealing it. And several of his Cabinet picks are longtime players on Wall Street or in Washington  —   the “swamp,” in Trump's words, that he has pledged to drain.        Trump held a rally in Cincinnati on Thursday, part of what his team has called the USA Thank You Tour 2016. (Victoria   Washington Post)   Many of Trump's supporters who showed up to his first   rally in this Midwestern city Thursday night said they completely trust their   to make the right decisions for the country, even if they don't understand his motives. And they were quick to come up with explanations for why he's doing what he's doing  —   like suddenly being buddies with Romney. Meyer said that Trump is “trying to bring the party together” after the bruising election. The guy sitting behind her at the rally agreed. “If he could be someone who could really benefit his Cabinet and be better for America, I say go for it,” said Joe Terry, a    father of five who works in maintenance. Terry said he has no problem with Trump's pick for treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Hollywood producer who   a bank during the financial crisis that foreclosed on thousands of homeowners. “Let's face it, he's going to look out for corporations, to make things work for them, to bring jobs back home,” Terry said. “And as things trickle down  —   as they're going to because it's America  —   the little guy will get something, too. ” For secretary of state, Meyer said she hopes Trump will ultimately pick someone like former NY mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who stood by Trump when few would, or retired Gen. David H. Petraeus, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified material and is still on probation. “He paid the price,” said Meyer, who lives across the river from Cincinnati in northern Kentucky. “When you pay the price, then you're forgiven. And he did a fraction of what Hillary did. ”     Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump's Cabinet View Graphic     Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump's Cabinet   Meyer's favorite debate moment was when Trump told Clinton that if he were president, she would be in jail. “He looked right at her, and I loved it,” she said. But Meyer and her husband said that while they want to see Clinton held responsible for using a private email server while secretary of state, neither of them expected Trump to take on the issue himself. “I know what he was saying, but the president can't prosecute anybody,” said Robert “Bob” Meyer. “I think that's out of Trump's hands. He should leave it to the Justice Department, and she should be prosecuted. ” His wife agreed, adding: “It was a debate. . . . He doesn't always think. He's not a politician. He just says it. ” Still, at Trump's first mention of Clinton during the rally that night, the whole arena began chanting: “Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!”  Trump stood by and smiled. Sitting one section over from the Meyers was another couple in their 70s who were convinced that Trump's change in tone on Clinton is just a strategic act.  “I don't think it would stick anyhow because Obama could pardon her,” explained Bob Knopp, 74, a retired civil engineer. “I think it's really too early for him to really say a whole lot about anything. When Obama gets out of there, it might change again. ” For Susan Meyer, it feels like the country has already changed since the election  —   and she gave Trump credit for keeping open a Carrier furnace factory in Indianapolis rather than letting it move all of its jobs to Mexico. “It made my heart feel good to know that these families will have a Christmas,” she said. “I felt so good when he did that. And that's what I love about him. He didn't wait until his inauguration. He did it. He's a worker. He started calling up, and he's Trump, and they listened to him. ” The deal didn't happen quite that way. Carrier agreed not to shift about 800 manufacturing and management positions south of the border, in exchange for a $7 million incentive package from the state. About 1, 300 jobs will still move to Mexico, however.  Meyer and other Trump supporters shrugged at these details, saying that's just how business works. “At least he put forth the effort,” she said. “And he might not be able to do that with everybody. . . . But I want us to start producing things again. I want to buy a clothes item that's made in the good ol' U. S. A. I want to buy a sweeper that comes from the U. S. A. We don't produce, and that really bothers me. ” Meyer is hopeful that Trump will ease environmental restrictions to allow factories to open more easily  —   and create millions of jobs, secure the border, protect the country from terrorists, reduce the influence of wealthy lobbyists and rebuild the inner cities. She told her friends that if Trump doesn't deliver, they can “boot him out. ” “I want him to achieve,” she said. “He might not be able to do everything all at once, but as long as he progresses and shows that he's trying, making an effort, okay. But I will hold him to some of those promises. ” "

","         There may never in American history have been a president who tried harder to unify the country, and got as little credit for it from his opponents, as Obama. Despite being unfailingly thoughtful and always insisting political disagreements weren't personal, Obama was portrayed by Republicans as some kind of   rage monster whose only goal was to set Americans against each other. They attacked him for not being enough of a unifier while simultaneously accusing him of intentionally trying to destroy the country. Well now we're going to see what it's really like to have a president who wants to divide the country. Trump and the people who work for him are giving new meaning to the term “sore winner,” and there's no reason to think they'll change anything once he's actually in the Oval Office. On Thursday,   Trump went to Ohio for a rally, as part of what is being billed as a “thank you tour” of states that he won in the election. Consider what Republicans would be saying if Clinton had won the electoral college, then proceeded to visit only the states that had supported her. They would say it showed what a hateful,    divider she was, caring only about the Americans that were already in her camp and doing nothing to reach out to the other side. Yet despite the fact that Trump lost the vote by over 2½ million votes, I've seen barely any appeals for him to reach across the aisle, not enact too ambitious an agenda, or try to understand the experiences and feelings of the 72 million (and counting) voters who didn't want him to be their president. He certainly didn't do that Thursday. As we've seen before, Trump had a somewhat conciliatory text written for him on the teleprompter, which had some words about the whole country coming together. And then, as he often does, he went on his own extemporaneous assault, lashing out at the news media, Republicans leaders, his primary opponents,   protesters and, of course, Clinton  —   to which the crowd responded with that oldie but goodie, chants of “Lock her up!”  On the same day, Trump's top aides were at Harvard for a public postmortem with officials from the Clinton campaign, which devolved into a shouting match. Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, took deep offense at Clinton communication director Jennifer Palmieri's suggestion that the Trump campaign became a platform for white supremacists. “Do you think I ran a campaign where white supremacists had a platform?” Conway asked incredulously. What a crazy notion, when the campaign's CEO came from a white nationalist website, her candidate routinely retweeted white supremacist messages, and he was endorsed by the KKK. How could anyone have gotten that idea? But Conway's key message was essentially the same as her boss': Suck it up, losers. “Hashtag he's your president. How's that?” she said. “Will you ever accept the election results? Will you tell your protesters that he's their president, too?” When it was over, Matthew Dowd, a strategist for George W. Bush, tweeted, “What we learned tonight from Trump's speech and Trump campaign at Harvard is they have not an ounce of graciousness or humility amongst them. ”  So what does this portend for the Trump presidency? Does Trump have it in him to reach out beyond his core supporters? I think some of the keys to foreseeing the shape of his presidency lie in the lessons he took from his campaign. He got away with things like not releasing his tax returns, and that taught him that he can subvert and violate those kinds of norms without consequence. And he also learned something important about appealing only to his base. Most analysts  —   myself included  —   thought it would be impossible for him to find enough “missing” white votes to overcome the Democrats' advantage among nonwhite and urban voters. We were wrong about that. His message of resentment, anger and fear turned out enough of those voters for him to move past Clinton in key Midwest states and win an electoral college victory  From that, Trump will almost surely take the lesson that he doesn't need to reach out to anybody; he can win by appealing only to his rabid base. And that's what he's inclined to do anyway. As we know by now, Trump is uncommonly   and vindictive. He'll never generously welcome in someone who has opposed him; if you were against him, the only way you can win back his favor is to engage in a public ritual of supplication and humiliation, as the likes of Chris Christie and Ted Cruz did  —   and that's after he's taken his revenge on you.  There's no reason to believe Trump thinks any differently about the majority of voters who opposed him as he does about his vanquished rivals. If there's one thing we should understand about Trump by now, it's that he is who he has always been and he isn't going to change. On a regular basis he'll be reinforcing his supporters' belief that people who didn't vote for Trump are the enemy, and Democrats' belief that the president is actively trying to vilify them and undermine their  . You can argue  —   and I have before  —   that it isn't really within the president's power to make us all come together as one (the only thing that really does is an external threat). But a president can certainly make the divisions in our country worse. How much worse? We're about to find out.

"," It is a sign of how secretive the new administration plans to be that when Trump spoke this week with the Pakistani prime minister, Americans learned what was discussed not from their   but from the oppressive Pakistani government's Ministry of Information.  Luckily, ministry Press Release No. 298  —   Pakistan's official “readout” of the phone call  —   so perfectly captured the  's way of speaking that there can be little doubt it is close to a verbatim account. It is 193 words of unintentional literary genius:  “Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif called   USA Trump and felicitated him on his victory. Trump said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif you have a very good reputation. You are a terrific guy. You are doing amazing work which is visible in every way. I am looking forward to see you soon. As I am talking to you Prime Minister, I feel I am talking to a person I have known for long. Your country is amazing with tremendous opportunities. Pakistanis are one of the most intelligent people. I am ready and willing to play any role that you want me to play to address and find solutions to the outstanding problems. It will be an honor and I will personally do it. Feel free to call me any time even before 20th January that is before I assume my office.  “On being invited to visit Pakistan by the Prime Minister, Mr. Trump said that he would love to come to a fantastic country, fantastic place of fantastic people. Please convey to the Pakistani people that they are amazing and all Pakistanis I have known are exceptional people, said Mr. Trump. ”  What made Trump's conversation with Sharif all the more terrific, amazing, tremendous, fantastic and exceptional was that only days earlier, a member of Trump's transition team had told journalists in India that Trump is in favor of legislation declaring Pakistan a “terror state. ” The promise, consistent with Trump's previous complaints about Pakistan's “betrayal and disrespect,” was huge news on the subcontinent.     Vice   Pence on Nov. 30 said senators and congressmen should “buckle up” for   Trump's legislative agenda. Pence and Trump's chief of staff Reince Priebus were meeting with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan. (The Washington Post)   To summarize: Pakistan is a fantastic and exceptional state sponsor of terrorism! Sharif does amazing, tremendous work with terrorists! Terrific. I'm felicitated.  The contradictory messages to the   arch rivals tells us something about how Trump operates: He tells whoever is listening to him exactly what that person wants to hear.

","         Congratulations! The American people have given you the formidable responsibility of assembling a Cabinet. The best Cabinet ever, you promised! And with none of the problems of previous Cabinets. And without any ties to plutocrats or the grotesque handful of corporations, like Goldman Sachs, that are squeezing the life out of the American people. You will not let the American people down! 1. Surreptitiously Google “What is a Cabinet?” 2. The first thing that comes up is some sort of rap battle from that cursed musical “Hamilton. ” 3. Okay. This is fine. You can do this. 4. FIFTEEN DEPARTMENTS? 5. If you had only known you would have had more children. 6. Okay, you had better write these departments down. Where is a pen? 7. “How is the Cabinet coming?” Melania Trump asks. “Fine,” you say, holding up a pen. “Huge progress. ” 8. Mitt Romney has called you eight times. You wonder why. 9. “The Cabinet,” you read online, “includes the Vice President and the heads of 15 executive departments  —   the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Attorney General. ” This is too many. No. 10. Sit with your head in your hands in an attitude of desperation until Ivanka Trump comes in. Tweet something ambiguous about your mental state. Members of the press take it literally and worry that you are coming for them. 11. If America were a dictatorship, would you still need to do all this? Probably you would need to do more. Ugh. Why can't America be like England where boring people get to yell at each other about policy and one person gets to wear ermine and sashay elegantly around touching babies and having diamond jubilees? 12. Maybe there is a reality TV show about Cabinets. Spend the next six hours surfing cable trying to find one. 13. “DUCK DYNASTY” IS RIVETING! WHERE HAS THIS SHOW BEEN ALL YOUR LIFE? 14. “How is the Cabinet coming?” Reince Priebus asks. 15. “Great. ” 16. “Any names in particular spring to mind?” Priebus asks. You glance helplessly around the room. There is a menu from the Trump Grill and a bill for hair restoration. “Price,” you say, hopelessly. “Chow. ” He keeps staring at you hopefully. “Jeff,” you say. There is probably someone in the world named Jeff. 17. “Tom Price?” Priebus asks. “Elaine Chao? Jeff   …     Sessions?” 18. “Yes, obviously. ” 19. Squint down at the list, and pick three departments at random. “Health and Human Services, Transportation and attorney general. ” 20. Priebus shrugs. “Sure,” he says. “Why not?” 21. You nod. “Any thoughts for secretary of state?” Priebus asks. 22. “I am thinking,” you say, after a long pause, “phone. ” 23. The phone rings. Mitt Romney! You are saved, kind of. Eegh, Mitt Romney. Maybe Kellyanne Conway can go on TV and say this is a bad idea. 24. “How about national security adviser?” Priebus asks. 25. That's not on this list at all. That sounds  . You are out of words. “Flin,” you say, after a long pause. Oh no, that's not a word at all! 26. “Mike Flynn?” Priebus asks. 27. “Yes,” you say quickly. “Of course. Him. ” 28. “Are there other surprise people I do not know whom I will need?” you ask Obama, when he next calls. 29. “Surprise people?” Obama asks. He sounds a little stunned. “You mean important presidential appointments who don't come up when you Google ‘Cabinet,' like the U. N. ambassador or CIA director?” If you paid attention to these things, you would detect a certain strain in his voice. “You didn't just Google this, did you?” 30. “Of course not,” you say, grumpily. You write those down in Sharpie and hang up. 31. This is very stressful. You have earned a taco bowl. While you wait for it, write down the names of every person you have ever met, organized from Most Rich to Least Rich. 32. Draw lines connecting them to your list of jobs at random. Hooray, Betsy DeVos is now education secretary! Wilbur Ross can be commerce secretary! This is like a crossword puzzle, but much easier. 33. Treasury. You know you promised the American people something about the Treasury and Goldman Sachs, but you can't remember what. 34. Just in case, appoint a former Goldman Sachs executive secretary of the treasury. Okay, great. Progress. 35. See? You can do this. You can do anything. All you have to do is believe. That is how you were elected president. You should remember that. 36. Your taco bowl arrives. 37. As you eat, some of it spills on the name “James Mattis. ” Smile ear to ear. 38. This will not be so hard after all."

","         The job of a president's national security adviser often resembles the challenge of jaywalking across an   boulevard without being run over. The jockeying among Cabinet members, the grinding interagency process, the traps and manholes that arise, not to mention crisis management, are enough to fray the nerves of even the steeliest aide. President Carter's national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, was awakened at home just after 2:26 a. m. on June 3, 1980. He was told that two intercontinental ballistic missiles were headed toward the USA. After the first signals, the displays showed even more missiles coming. After three minutes, the alert was ended  —   a false alarm, caused by the failure of a computer chip, but for those minutes, all too real. If the adrenaline rush is not enough, imagine the headaches in sorting out feuds between the secretaries of state and defense, as happened under President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. He went through six national security advisers in eight years. Trump's choice for the job seems confident that everything will come up roses. Retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn tweeted Thursday night: We are going to win and win and win at everything we do. It is going to be tough, but Team   will #MAGA 🇺🇸🍀🏄  —   General Flynn (@GenFlynn) December 2, 2016  It is a shame to dampen his enthusiasm, but the world does not work this way. To predict victory at everything is to be disconnected from reality. The national security adviser is supposed to be the one who connects the president to reality. What Flynn offers  —   and what Trump has promoted all year  —   is a magic elixir, a lovely vacation from all troubles. One may dismiss Trump's boasts as political slogans, but does Flynn, the man who will get the call in the middle of the night, actually believe his own irrational exuberance? Let's imagine his first day in the West Wing. An aide delivers to the national security adviser some bad news: Hackers have infiltrated the personnel files of the U. S. government and stolen the personal information of 4. 2 million former and current government employees, and they've grabbed sensitive security clearance background information on 21 million people. Also, the fingerprint data of 5. 6 million people was stolen. Some of them are U. S. intelligence and law enforcement officers in the field. The private information could be harmful in the wrong hands. The files are gone, it is too late to stop the thieves and they did not leave an address. This actually happened not too long ago at the Office of Personnel Management, in what is certainly one of the worst cyberattacks ever on the U. S. government. How do you “win and win and win at everything” when you can't even identify who the enemy is? This is the reality of shadowy and vexing cyberconflict that has been intensifying in recent years  —   perpetrators sneaking up at network speed, nearly impossible to identify, a war that can be entirely asymmetric, meaning that the little guys can win, win and win again. Shall we move on to Day Two?              Caption     Trump faces a challenge as he prepares for his move to the White House: selecting the men and women who will fill his administration.

","         If they ever remake that 1958 classic “The Fly,” Mitt Romney should play the fly and Trump the spider that comes to eat him. “Help me, help me,” the fly cries as the spider moves in for the kill. Only in real life, nothing can help Romney. Instead of being a creature with the head of a man and the body of a fly, he has the head of a man and the quivering body of a jellyfish. It's a different movie, I grant you  —   but still horrible to watch. Once, Romney was all man. He was the governor of Massachusetts  —   a progressive state  —     of a sizable financial firm, and then Republican nominee for president. I did not vote for him, but I always thought he'd make a passable president  —   he certainly looked the part. This time around, he was just about the only Republican to stay out of the presidential race, meaning that he did not have to suffer the ignominy of losing to Trump. Trump was the worst possible choice: a flamboyant ignoramus  —   narcissistic and cruel as they all are  —   and a bully and a cheat and a liar, with bad hair to boot.  During the 2016 campaign, Romney rose to the occasion. He denounced Trump as a “phony” and a “fraud. ” He called his promises “worthless,” said he tolerated bigotry and suggested that Trump University lacked more than a football team. In fact, Romney devoted a whole speech to a denunciation of Trump. It was, as Winston Churchill said in a somewhat different context, his “finest hour. ” It was, however, an hour that lasted a NY minute. In fact, it was to that very city that Romney came hat in hand. He wants to be Trump's secretary of state. Trump has heard him out  —   twice. Romney has been out to Trump's golf course for a meeting and then joined Trump and the flexible Reince Priebus for a dinner the other night at   restaurant. It is a swell place in Trump International Hotel & Tower NY on the West Side, known for French food. That night, however, crow must have been on the menu. It's possible that Trump may yet pick Romney. Abraham Lincoln famously put together a “team of rivals” for his Cabinet, but if I may go out on a limb here, Trump is no Lincoln. Instead, he's a blowhard who is not likely to have increased his respect for Romney by watching him grovel. The performance, I might add, has surely been noticed by foreign governments, with whom a StateSecretary Romney would be dealing. They now know that a breakfast meeting with him would mean two bowls of mush. His word would mean nothing. He would be, as Vyacheslav Molotov was to Joseph Stalin, a   errand boy who would have to prove his loyalty over and over again.  Trump has proved to be minimally useful, offering a kind of litmus test for character. There are those who stand up to him and those who grovel. Romney is in the latter camp, proving  —   if nothing else  —   that he would have made a weak president. He is not a man's head on the body of a fly. He is a man's head on the body of a puppy. Beg, Mitt. Roll over, Mitt. Aw, Mitt, look what you've done! Bad Mitt."
145482,217366,Washington Monument to remain closed for at least two more years,Washington Post,Michael E. Ruane,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161203001010/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/washington-monument-to-remain-closed-for-at-least-two-more-years/2016/12/02/c2aab9aa-b5ae-11e6-a677-b608fbb3aaf6_story.html
","   Billionaire philanthropist David Rubenstein has agreed to fund an overhaul of the Washington Monument's broken elevator system, but the beleaguered landmark will probably remain closed for the next 2    years, the National Park Service says.  It is the second time that Rubenstein has come to the aid of the monument, which has been shuttered since Aug. 17 because of chronic elevator problems. After the 2011 earthquake, he donated $7. 5 million of the $15 million cost of repairing the    obelisk.  But there is no start date for the roughly   elevator project, which will cost $2 million to $3 million, because the Park Service is awaiting funds for a new security screening entrance that it wants to build at the same time. And even if those funds come through, the Park Service does not see the monument reopening until the “cherry blossom season in 2019,” a spokesman, Mike Litterst, said in an email. “It does seem like it's a long period of time,” said Will Shafroth, president of the National Park Foundation, the charitable partner that is facilitating Rubenstein's donation. “Just know that the Park Service is moving as fast as it can. ” “As frustrating as it can be, they're a federal agency,” he said. “We're talking about one of our national monuments . . . A lot of people have a say in it, and it tends to grind the process a little bit slower than we'd like. ” The centerpiece of the Mall, the monument had just reopened two years ago after an almost   shutdown after the earthquake. Normally entered by about 500, 000 visitors a year, the   icon is a hallowed symbol of the USA and of Washington. “It's the first thing people see when they come to the city,” said Sean Kennealy, chief of the professional services division for the Park Service's National Mall and Memorial Parks.  Construction began in 1848. It was dedicated in 1885 and honors George Washington, a Revolutionary War hero and the nation's first president. The Park Service says the elevator, which carries visitors to an observation level where the views are spectacular, is too unreliable to resume operations. It broke down numerous times in recent months, stranding groups of visitors and staff on board or at upper levels, and requiring calls to the D. C. fire department. Rubenstein is a founder of the Carlyle Group, a   global private equity firm, and has been a major benefactor of historic sites and institutions across the region. This year, he announced an $18. 5 million donation to help renovate the Lincoln Memorial. Last year, he pledged a $5. 37 million donation to refurbish the U. S. Marine Corps War Memorial near Arlington National Cemetery. In 2014, he gave $10 million to Montpelier, the historic Orange, Va. home of James Madison; $5 million to the White House Visitor Center; and $12. 3 million to Arlington House, the home of Robert E. Lee. He said his goal after the earthquake was to get the monument reopened to the public as soon as possible, and the goal is the same now. “The thing to do is to make the place as hospitable as possible and as safe as possible,” he said. “It's a monument that's going to be around for another 100, 200, 300 years, who knows how long. ” “Obviously, like everybody, I wish it was ready tomorrow,” he said. “But that's not realistic. I want to make sure it's done right, and if that's what they say it takes, that's what it takes. ” As for the elevator, “It was a very difficult decision to say that we need to close . . . until we can completely modernize this,” said Gay E. Vietzke, superintendent of the National Mall and Memorial Parks. “But we really felt that we owed the public a positive, seamless experience,” she said. “And we were at a place where we couldn't offer that. ” She called it “ an unpredictable situation. ” “Say you're [stuck] in the cab . . . and you have 30 or 40 minutes to wait” for emergency crews, Vietzke said. “And you're claustrophobic, or someone's sick, or has a condition. ” The elevator problems came just as the Park Service was about to launch an   $9 million project to build the permanent security screening facility. The present facility is temporary. That project, which also would require closing the monument, is awaiting government funding, Vietzke said. The Park Service wants to proceed with the two projects simultaneously, so it can save money and avoid one shutdown, followed by another one. “We want to try to do all the construction at the same time to minimize the period that we're closed to the public,” she said. “There's a scenario where we could do the elevator, and then have the money for the [security] building come, and have to do that, and it would be a much longer closure period,” she said. But it is unclear when the funding request, now before Congress, might be approved. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton ( . C.) the city's nonvoting member of Congress, said in a statement that she would work “to help secure the funding . . . so that the dual projects can take place at the same time . . . [and get] the monument to reopen as soon as possible. ” The Park Service said the new facility will feature ballistic glass and screening equipment and will be able to handle 20 to 25 visitors at a time. Kennealy said the monument may have the most heavily used elevator in Washington. “Our elevator runs, during the summer months . . . 13 hours a day, nonstop,” he said. “It doesn't rest. . . . This thing is running constantly, the motor, the gears, the control system, the doors. ” The monument has had an elevator since it opened. The first was   and took 12 minutes to reach the top. The trip now takes 70 seconds. The Park Service wants to replace the elevator's   computer controls, the door systems, cab lighting and ventilation, and cables, and study the idea of a cab that does not need a park ranger onboard. The powerful electric motor, which dates to the 1960s, is “a beast,” Kennealy said, and only needs refurbishing. The situation “is a drag, at this moment,” said Brian D. Joyner, chief of staff for the National Mall and Memorial Parks. “But it will be better. ”  Kelsey Snell contributed to this report. "
145483,217367,"One year after the San Bernardino attack, police offer a possible motive as questions still linger",Washington Post,Mark Berman,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161203001010/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/12/02/one-year-after-san-bernardino-police-offer-a-possible-motive-as-questions-still-linger/
","     A year after the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif. that killed 14 people and wounded 22 others, authorities are still probing the shooting and trying to answer lingering questions about what happened. Since the rampage, the FBI has waged a   fight with Apple over accessing a phone used by one of the terrorists, pleaded with the public for information and charged people related to the shooters with other crimes unearthed during the investigation. But a year after one of the deadliest attacks in the USA since Sept. 11, 2001, the FBI is still trying to determine whether anyone helped the attackers and hoping to figure out what the couple did during a mysterious period of time before dying in a shootout with police. On the morning of Dec. 2, 2015, workers with San Bernardino County's health department were gathered for a training session when Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the employees, left and returned with his wife, Tashfeen Malik. The pair began shooting at Farook's   ultimately firing more than 100 rounds before fleeing, according to a report released by the Justice Department. Four hours later, police tracked the couple down and killed them during a frenzied gun battle on a residential street.  The FBI said it was investigating the shooting as an act of terrorism after it emerged that Malik had posted a pledge of allegiance on Facebook to the leader of the ISIS, a message made on behalf of both attackers. Authorities say both were radicalized for some time before the attack, although investigators said they do not think Malik and Farook were directly guided by a foreign terrorist group. “The brutality of the attack's perpetrators could not have been in starker contrast to the selflessness and generosity that characterized those taken from us,” the White House said in a statement marking the anniversary Friday and honoring the victims of the attack. Using another acronym for the ISIS, the message continued: “In the year since this tragedy, we have mourned those we lost, just as we have continued to confront the violent ideology behind this attack as well as the terrorist groups, including ISIL, that propagate it. ” In a new interview broadcast this week, the police chief in San Bernardino said authorities believe that the specifics of the attack  —   targeting that particular gathering at that time  —   may have been motivated by the holiday party set to take place in the same room after the training ended. The chief, Jarrod Burguan, cited comments made by the female attacker before the shooting. Malik had said online “that she didn't think that a Muslim should have to participate in a   holiday or event,” Burguan told ABC News. The room where the training occurred  —   the same room where the health department had held   training earlier that year  —   was filled at the time with Christmas decorations, including a large Christmas tree, ornaments and items on the walls.    San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan speaks at a news conference after the attack. (Chris   Press)  “That really is one of the very, very few pieces of potential evidence that we have that we can truly point to and say, that possibly is a motive in this case,” Burguan said. Investigators have said that both Farook and his wife showed a   interest in potential violence. Before the couple got married and Malik came to the USA, the two exchanged messages online “showing signs in their communication of their joint commitment to jihad and to martyrdom,” FBI Director James B. Comey said last year. The missing 18 minutes About four hours elapsed between the mass shooting and the deaths of Farook and Malik. Federal investigators say they have tracked most of their activity during that period, but they have still not been able to pin down what they did during a mysterious 18 minutes. In January, the FBI appealed to the public for any help, saying that it could be crucial to determining whether the couple interacted with anyone else after the shooting. David Bow dich, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles office, said this gap was pivotal because “until we close that gap, we just don't know for sure. ”    Photo of Tashfeen Malik, center, and Syed Rizwan Farook, right, going through Chicago's O'Hare International Airport in 2014. (ABC News)  Through traffic cameras, surveillance footage, witnesses and other resources, investigators have figured out some of what Farook and Malik did during the four hours. About 45 minutes after the shooting, they visited the city's Lake Seccombe, so evidence recovery divers were dispatched into the water to see what they could find. None of the items recovered appeared to be relevant to the investigation, the FBI said. There is still a window between 12:59 p. m. and 1:17 p. m. where, as Bowdich put it earlier this year, “we're dark. ” The iPhone fight The investigation has not resulted in any charges directly stemming from the attack, but authorities are still looking at “whether Farook and Malik were supported in any way in the planning, financing or execution of the attack,” Laura Eimiller, an FBI spokeswoman, said in an email. This lingering question of whether anyone was involved in or knew about the plot played a central role in a bitter fight between Apple and the Justice Department over Farook's iPhone. Federal authorities had demanded that Apple unlock the device, but the tech giant pushed back in what became an ongoing    with broader implications for encryption and security.    FBI Director James B. Comey had argued that it was necessary for Apple to help unlock the phone. (Jonathan  )  Apple argued that the fight was about “much more than a single phone or a single investigation” and could threaten civil liberties, while Comey, the FBI director, said investigators needed to access the phone because it was possible it “holds the clue to finding more terrorists. ” Ultimately, the FBI wound up paying professional hackers a sizable   fee, ending for the moment that particular feud with Apple. According to officials, nothing of particular significance was found on the phone, which was owned by the county and issued to Farook through his job. False reports of people seeing “bombs all over the apartment” While investigators continue checking whether anyone else knew about the attack, a particularly   voice has repeatedly suggested that there are people who knew Farook and Malik had amassed explosives and guns and never reported it.   Trump has asserted that numerous people saw these devices in the couple's home and never said anything. (He has used this claim to argue that American Muslims need to report suspicious activity, which the FBI says they already do.)  “In San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people,” Trump said during the second presidential debate, adding: “Muslims have to report the problems when they see them. ” He has made similar comments before, asserting that people said nothing out of fear of being accused of racial profiling. The remarks appear to be based on interviews given by people in the area around the couple's home after the shooting. One person working in the neighborhood told a local outlet he had seen numerous Middle Eastern men in the area but did not report anything to avoid racial profiling. Another man told a local broadcast station that an unspecified person saw purported suspicious activity  —   including the couple getting numerous deliveries and working in the garage at odd times  —   but, again, did not want to be seen as involved in racial profiling. Neither of these accounts included anyone saying they “saw bombs all over the apartment” of the attackers, as Trump asserted. Eimiller, the FBI spokeswoman, said investigators have not substantiated any of those accounts given to news outlets.    A makeshift vigil near the shooting site last year. (Jabin   Washington Post)  Friends and family of the attackers arrested Farook and Malik orphaned their    daughter the day of the attack, and Farook's older sister, Saira Khan, is still trying to get custody of the toddler. “What kind of parent makes plans to abandon their child?” she told The Washington Post recently. “How were they capable of something like that and we didn't know?” Federal authorities have said that Farook had also plotted at least two other attacks years before he spoke with Malik, making detailed plans with his friend, Enrique Marquez Jr. who was arrested last year.    In a courtroom sketch, Enrique Marquez Jr. appeared in federal court. (Bill  )  Authorities said there is no evidence that Marquez had any involvement in the attack last year, but they charged him with buying the guns that would be used in the shooting and said he bought explosive material found in a pipe bomb left behind by Farook and Malik. Marquez is one of four people connected to the attackers who has been arrested and charged since the shooting, although none were accused of any direct involvement. Earlier this year, officials arrested Farook's brother, Syed Raheel Farook, as well as Raheel's wife, Tatiana Farook, and her sister, Mariya Chernykh. Marquez and Chernykh are married, and they are all accused of committing fraud or lying to keep up a sham marriage so that she could get immigration benefits. Raheel, his wife and his    are all set to stand trial in March, while Marquez's trial is set for next September, nearly two years after he was arrested.

His campaign's embrace of rumor defied the rules of electoral civility, turning the presidential race into the bitterest in decades.   His country is Austria, and his name is Norbert Hofer. Austrians go the polls Sunday in a rerun presidential election following a campaign displaying remarkable similarities to populist politics on both sides of the Atlantic. It is as if Hofer  —   from the nationalist,   Freedom Party  —   is reading from the same winning playbook as   Trump.  Take, for example, the question of “stamina. ”  As early as the spring, Hofer, 45, began exuding concern about the health of his   opponent, Alexander Van der Bellen, noting the   's “forgetfulness. ”    Austrian presidential candidate Alexander Van der Bellen, who is supported by the Greens, listens during an interview with Reuters in his office in Vienna, Austria, Nov. 11, 2016. (Leonhard  )  What followed was the kind of electioneering rare in Austrian politics. Hofer's campaign manager then told the media that “Mr. Van der Bellen appears slow; in fact, he displays a certain exhaustion. ” By June, the   blog “Politically Incorrect” published a letter allegedly submitted to Austrian authorities asserting that Van der Bellen was stricken with dementia and cancer. So severe was his case  —   the fake letter attested  —   that Van der Bellen required a legal guardian.  The Freedom Party denied any links to the letter. But the fake news spread so quickly  —   and so damagingly  —   that Van der Bellen's campaign was forced to release his medical records to refute them. The health issue was only one of several false rumors and reports  —   including allegations of Van der Bellen family ties to the Nazis  —   that his campaign has struggled to put down.    slogans, meanwhile, have popped up on the Internet, including a hashtag for “Make Austria Great Again” and an Internet meme showing the country's borders at the height of the   Empire.  Already, the Freedom Party is cultivating ties with the Trump camp. Ahead of the U. S. election, a Freedom Party delegation traveled to the USA and met with Trump's senior supporters, including Michael T. Flynn, who has been tapped as his national security adviser. Several Freedom Party politicians also attended the   celebration at Trump Tower in NY. “There have been a lot of insults, slander and even death threats against Van der Bellen, which goes well beyond the usual scrawling on posters and campaign buses,” said Lothar Lockl, Van der Bellen's campaign manager. “The anger and hatred deliberately spread along with fake news and false rumors in echo chambers on Facebook have been an issue. ” The candidates are now in a virtual tie. Should Hofer win, he would take over a ceremonial but constitutionally ambiguous job as president that he has contentiously vowed to vest with real power.      Meet the European leaders hoping to cause the next Brexit View Graphic     Meet the European leaders hoping to cause the next Brexit  In the wake of the American elections, calculations on his electability have changed. From the snowy Alps to the emerald wine country in Austria's deep south, talk now is of a possible “Trump bump”  —   a sense that Americans may have broken a key psychological barrier in their election last month.  Like Clinton's campaign, Van der Bellen's is asking Austrians to vote for him in part to reject Hofer and avoid damaging the nation's reputation on the world stage. Yet, if the USA can elect Trump, then why, some here argue, shouldn't Austrians give Hofer a chance?  In fact, Hofer's supporters say, he would simply be the next pillar in a “new world order” in which   nationalists could rise from Washington to Vienna, Paris to The Hague. They see the disruptive forces of the   spreading. Italians on Sunday will vote on a restructuring referendum deeply opposed by the populist Five Star Movement. The measure's failure could bring down the   government. “Wherever the elites distance themselves from voters, those elites will be voted out of office,” Hofer told Reuters last month. “One comparison could be that Trump also had strong [political] headwinds in the U. S. and he won the election anyway. ” As if in an alternate reality in which Trump lost and contested the race, Hofer's Freedom Party did just that  —   successfully overturning his defeat by just 31, 000 votes last May.  If made the first   head of state in Western Europe since World War II, Hofer could exercise his duties in unprecedented ways, his campaign says. He might refuse, for instance, to sign Europe's free trade deal with Canada and could call a referendum on the Paris Agreement to combat climate change. He has also flirted with a referendum on EU membership  —   a possible death blow to the bloc following Britain's vote to leave it.  As with Trump's tactics in the USA, Hofer's methods have upended politics here. Hofer tends to portray the hosts of debates as well as his opponents as foolish when he is asked critical questions, and, in   fashion, he launches into unrelated attacks. When asked during a debate whether he should distance himself from Austria's nationalistic fraternities long linked to racists, Hofer, for instance, attacked the questioner. “You are so desperate and depressed today. When I saw you six weeks ago, you were such a happy person,” he retorted. While somehow maintaining a    demeanor, Hofer drops innuendoes like bombs and takes seemingly contradictory positions. He has courted Jews and Israel. Yet during a debate, he accused Van der Bellen of being supported by the Freemasons  —   which some observers saw as an   reference to a Jewish power structure.  In manner, Hofer is wholly unlike the bombastic Trump, speaking in an   style that comes off as downright neighborly. Last month, he told Austrian broadcaster ZIB 2 that Trump's election campaign had been “horrible. ” “I'm happy that we don't have anything like this in this style in Austria,” he said. Yet Hofer has embraced an uncannily similar platform. He is   speaks of   fences, says Islam is “not part” of Austria and wants to increase surveillance on mosques.  His single biggest issue is immigration. He argues that at current birthrates, Muslim immigrants would soon overwhelm native Austrians. A 2013 study said the number of Muslims in Austria increased almost 70 percent since 2001, reaching 574, 000, or 7 percent of the population.     Hofer's campaign maintains a complex, synergistic relationship with Austria's Identitarian activists  —   a   movement supporting   nationalism. While he has distanced himself from the movement, his party leadership has also cultivated it  —   sharing, for instance, stories sympathetic to the group on social media. Martin Sellner, a university student in Vienna and Identitarian who sports an undercut hair style with a sharp part that is popular with   youth, is a living bridge between Trump and Hofer. He proudly owns a “Make America Great Again” hat and, on the night of the U. S. election, burst in on a Democrats Abroad pub party in Vienna to shout “Lock her up!” and “Build that wall!”  Austria's nationalists, he hopes, will get their chance on Sunday. “We want to disrupt the firewall of multicultural societies,” he said. “You did it in the U. S. with Trump. Now we want it here. ”  Stephanie Kirchner contributed to this report.     "
145485,217369,Second-chance law for young criminals puts violent offenders back on D.C. streets,Washington Post,Amy Brittain,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161203001010/https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/second-chance-law-for-young-criminals-puts-violent-offenders-back-on-dc-streets/2016/12/02/fcb56c74-8bc1-11e6-875e-2c1bfe943b66_story.html
","          CITY | This is part of a continuing series that will examine issues related to repeat violent offenders in the District of Columbia.  Part I | Part II     Hundreds of criminals sentenced by D. C. judges under an obscure local law crafted to give second chances to young adult offenders have gone on to rob, rape or kill residents of the nation's capital. The original intent of the law was to rehabilitate inexperienced criminals under the age of 22. The District's Youth Rehabilitation Act allows for shorter sentences for some crimes and an opportunity for offenders to emerge with no criminal record. But a Washington Post investigation has found a pattern of violent offenders returning rapidly to the streets and committing more crimes. Hundreds have been sentenced under the act multiple times. In dozens of cases, D. C. judges were able to hand down Youth Act sentences shorter than those called for under mandatory minimum laws designed to deter armed robberies and other violent crimes. The criminals have often repaid that leniency by escalating their crimes of violence upon release. In 2013, four masked men entered the home of a family in Northeast Washington, held them at gunpoint and ransacked the house. One of the invaders, Shareem Hall, was sentenced under the Youth Act. He was released on probation in 2015. Almost exactly a year later, Hall and a   shot a    transgender woman, Deeniquia Dodds, during a robbery in the District, according to charging documents. It is unclear who pulled the trigger. Police said the pair were targeting transgender females. Dodds died nine days later. “You're telling me you can come back out on the streets and rob again, hold people hostage again, kill again  —   because of the Youth Act?” said Joeann Lewis, Dodds's aunt.    Joeann Lewis, with the ashes of her niece, Deeniquia Dodds, a transgender woman killed in Northeast Washington in July, allegedly by Shareem Hall and a  . (Linda   Washington Post)  Hall is one of at least 121 defendants sentenced under the Youth Act who have gone on to be charged with murder in the District since 2010, according to The Post's analysis of available sentencing data and court records. Four of the slayings, including the killing of Dodds, occurred while the defendants could still have been incarcerated for previous crimes under mandatory minimum sentencing, and 30 of the killings took place while the suspects were on probation. Youth Act offenders accounted for 1 in 5 suspects arrested on homicide charges in the District since 2010, a period that has seen a recent surge in homicides and growing public concern about repeat violent offenders. The cycle of violence has been largely shrouded from public view or oversight. D. C. judges do not track the use of the law, which provides a benefit to violent felons that experts say does not exist anywhere else in the country.      The District's Youth Rehabilitation Act offers lenient sentences to offenders under 22 years old. But the Post found that at least 120 people sentenced under the Act since 2010 have gone on to be charged with murder. (Whitney   Washington Post)   After a young adult is convicted of a crime, the Youth Act allows judges to decide whether the offender can benefit from rehabilitation and should receive special treatment. The law gives felons a chance to have their convictions expunged from the public record if they serve out their sentences or complete their probation. Because of the way the law was written, Youth Act offenders also can avoid mandatory prison time for certain violent gun crimes. The Post also found that judges applying the Youth Act generally give lighter sentences across the board. The law was enacted in 1985 during the mayoral administration of Marion Barry (D) at a time when jails were being filled with young men charged with drug crimes, in an attempt to protect African American youths from the stigma of lengthy prison sentences.  “We have a value in this city that youthful offenders should be rehabilitated,” said D. C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser. “But I don't think anybody expects leniency for violent criminals. ” The judges declined The Post's requests for interviews and also declined to comment about specific cases. In a written statement, the judges said they weigh many factors in sentencing, including the ages of offenders and the effect of their crimes on the victims.    “In considering whether to sentence a young person under the Youth Act, generally judges are aware that a felony conviction can create lifelong obstacles to becoming a good and productive citizen,” wrote Lynn Leibovitz and Milton Lee, who are, respectively, the presiding judge and deputy presiding judge of the criminal division of the D. C. Superior Court. “It is important to note that a sentence under the Youth Act gives the defendant this opportunity, not a guarantee, to get the benefit of a set aside of the conviction  —   it is still up to the defendant to perform during his or her sentence and to apply to the court or the Parole Commission to receive the benefit of the Youth Act. If the offender does not perform well, the conviction remains on his or her record. ” The D. C. Public Defender Service defended the use of the law. “The Youth Act is a valuable sentencing option because as the Supreme Court has recognized and science has shown, youthful offenders, compared to older adults, can have diminished culpability and greater prospects for reform,” said PDS general counsel Laura Hankins in a written statement. She said her office knows of “hundreds” of young offenders who have successfully completed their sentences. From January 2010 to April 2016, 3, 188 sentences for felony crimes were handed down under the Youth Act, 73 percent of them in cases involving violent crimes or weapons offenses, The Post found.    To assess the effects of the Youth Act, The Post obtained data from the D. C. Sentencing Commission showing the date and outcome of every felony case since 2010. The data did not include names of offenders or judges, or details of the crimes. To link individuals to crimes, The Post wrote software to extract those details for every criminal case, including those that mentioned the Youth Act, in publicly available electronic court dockets. This search captured Youth Act cases in which people had not received the benefit of expungement either because they were still serving their sentences or had violated the terms of probation or release from prison. The overall success rate of the program is unclear because the identities of offenders disappear from public view if they complete the terms of their sentences. Among The Post's findings: • At least 136 Youth Act sentences were given to young offenders convicted of armed robbery since 2010. • At least 750 offenders have been sentenced multiple times under the Youth Act in the past decade. More than 200 of those were sentenced for multiple violent or weapons offenses. • Judges have given roughly 2, 300 Youth Act sentences to young offenders for weapons offenses or crimes of violence since 2010. On average, the offenders have received about 60 percent of the prison time of   Act offenders who had comparable criminal histories and had committed similar crimes.    When asked about The Post's findings, Leibovitz and Lee responded that the court “does not comment on data based on percentages, since sentencing is an individualized event based on many considerations. ” In a survey of states across the country, The Post was unable to find any law similar to the District's Youth Act. An expert in national expungement laws told The Post that leniency programs typically focus on   or juvenile offenders and apply expungement to misdemeanors or other nonviolent crimes. “I've never heard of something like this,” said Anne Teigen, a program principal at the National Conference of State Legislatures in Colorado. “It is opposite of the trend nationally. ” In the District, Youth Act sentences have been handed down in cases involving victims who are vulnerable in ways that ordinarily lead to tougher sentences: an elderly woman held up at gunpoint; a brother and sister  —   12 and 13 years old  —   kidnapped outside their middle school and held hostage by someone armed with a box cutter; a pizza deliveryman hit on the head with a brick during a robbery; the driver of an ice cream truck whose vehicle was taken during an armed carjacking. In the summer of 2015, a D. C. jury found    twins Christopher and Christina Lucas guilty of committing a hate crime against a gay man in Columbia Heights in 2013. The twins stomped on the man, one called him a “       ” and his face was slashed with a sharp object. Prosecutors said the case very easily “could have been a homicide. ” They asked for 15 years.    D. C. Superior Court Judge Yvonne Williams (Marvin   Washington Post)  D. C. Superior Court Judge Yvonne Williams departed from voluntary sentencing guidelines, which recommended four to 15 years, and gave the twins a year in jail under the Youth Act. At a hearing two weeks later, amid community outrage, Williams justified her decision by invoking the Eminem song, “Lose Yourself,” saying that the Youth Act was designed to give “one shot” for the twins to reform. “It's the most inspirational song, even though he's applying it to, like, rap music,” the judge said in court. “It's like, you only get one shot. And his one shot is that he had to  —   you know, it's in the movie ‘8 Mile' . . . the rap has to be so good. You only get one shot. ” The twins were rearrested this fall, Christopher for allegedly making a verbal threat and Christina for allegedly attempting to block officers from arresting her brother. Judge Williams declined to comment for this story. D. C. politicians wrote the Youth Act, but the judges, prosecutors and public defenders in the District who carry out the law are funded by Congress, because of the unique split in federal and local authority in the District. The judges are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate for   terms and are not accountable to D. C. voters. Briefed on The Post's findings, Mayor Bowser (D) said she thinks judges, prosecutors and public defenders have come to “misapply” the law at the expense of public safety. “Prosecutions, plea deals, sentences rendered, sentences served, and then what happens when folks are being supervised . . . the community should know that,” she said. “We can't have a safe city if there are no quick and certain punishments for crimes. ” ‘I saw their scared faces' Last year, homicides in the District jumped 54 percent from the previous year to 162, the highest total since 2008. A survey found that for the first time in almost a decade, crime had become the top concern of D. C. residents. Killings in 2015 charged to prior Youth Act recipients reached 22, double the previous year's total.  Tavon Pinkney was charged with one of those 22 homicides. In 2014, the    was arrested on a robbery charge after he snatched a man's Apple iPad. It was the first adult offense for Pinkney. “I wasn't really worried,” Pinkney said in a recent prison interview with The Post. “I knew they were going to let me off easy. ” Pinkney said that he had committed at least a dozen robberies by the time he was arrested. “I saw their scared faces,” he told The Post of his victims. “But I never thought about their feelings. I was just being selfish. ” Pinkney pleaded guilty to attempted robbery, and Judge Anita   suspended his sentence and gave him probation under the Youth Act. “I will give him a Youth Act because I do, and it may be aspirational, believe that people should have an opportunity to change their lives,” she said. But Pinkney didn't take that opportunity. “I went back to doing the same thing,” he said. “Nothing changed. . . . They just gave me the Youth Act and let me go right back out there. They ain't really care. ”     Rico Myers (Metropolitan Police Department)     Matthew Shlonsky (Metropolitan Police Department)    In February 2015, five months into his probation, Pinkney shot Rico Myers four times during a daytime PCP deal. He pleaded guilty to   murder and is serving a   sentence in federal prison in Pennsylvania. “I know I could have been better. It's just what I chose,” said Pinkney, who is now 20. “It's crazy, because my brain is not even fully developed yet. ” Judge   declined to comment for this story. In at least 30 homicide cases, defendants had received Youth Act sentences more than once before  —   turning a second chance into a third or even fourth opportunity to return to the community. Christopher Proctor, Andre Dudley and a third person are charged in the August 2015 killing of Matthew Shlonsky, a    American University graduate who was caught in crossfire near the Shaw Metro Station. Proctor had received two sentences under the Youth Act, including one for attempted theft in 2010. Dudley had received three sentences under the Youth Act, including one in 2014 for escaping from a youth detention facility. Both have pleaded not guilty in the shooting of Shlonsky.    Jermaine Hailes (Prince George's County Police)  “The program isn't working, because people are dying,” said Brendan Walsh, a fraternity brother of Shlonsky's. “The government has some culpability in that. ”  On New Year's Day in 2007, a    woman, Willa Kynard, was walking with her cane when a young man jumped out of a white van, pointed a gun at her and demanded her purse. “Oh, Jesus, don't let him shoot me,” Kynard thought, according to court documents. The van eventually crashed after a police chase, and Jermaine Hailes, then 16, who was found hiding in a dumpster, was linked to two other robberies that night. He was charged as an adult and pleaded guilty to one count of armed robbery. Judge Harold Cushenberry cited the Youth Act in sentencing Hailes to three years in prison, two years less than the mandatory minimum. Cushenberry declined to comment for this story. After his release from prison, Hailes shot    Melvin Pate in the face in 2010 during a robbery in Maryland. Pate, who was paralyzed, was able to identify Hailes as his attacker by blinking in response to being shown Hailes's picture in a photo lineup. Pate died two years after the shooting, and Hailes was convicted this year of   murder. A Prince George's County judge sentenced him to 70 years in prison.

(Family photo)  ‘Left of liberalism' The District's Youth Act was modeled after a failed federal law that was drafted in the 1940s for a different kind of criminal in a much different time. Members of Congress sought a way to curb juvenile delinquency, including clearing the records of soldiers returning from World War II who were getting permanent rap sheets with convictions for disorderly conduct, petty theft or assault. The Federal Youth Corrections Act, passed in 1950, applied to youthful offenders charged with federal crimes throughout the USA and all crimes in the District of Columbia. The goal was rehabilitation, not punishment. Congress eventually helped fund construction of a youth center at the site of the Lorton prison in Fairfax County, Va. to house most Youth Act prisoners from the District. There, the sleeping quarters resembled a college campus, and inmates were required to wear coats and ties. The Lorton Youth Center had a printing plant, a dairy farm and a furniture factory for vocational training.     An inmate sits on his bed in a dorm room at the Lorton Reformatory in Lorton, Va. in 1996. (James A.   Washington Post)     Inmates were gradually being moved from the prison in Lorton in the late 1990s. (Dennis   The Washington Post)    But riots broke out repeatedly in the 1960s and '70s, pushing prison officials to impose more   time. By the early 1980s, rising crime rates were souring the country on rehabilitation. In the District, residents overwhelmingly voted to implement mandatory minimum prison terms of five years for violent crimes committed with guns. In 1984, Congress repealed the federal Youth Act, in part because there was little evidence that the law was effective. The D. C. Council and   Barry expressed shock and disgust. Wilhelmina J. Rolark (D)   of the D. C. Council's Judiciary Committee, drafted a law for the District. Rolark, who died in 2006, said “extra care” needed to be taken to prevent young black men from being labeled as career criminals. Barry's administration argued that many violent crimes should be   for Youth Act sentences. But Rolark's committee said all crimes except for murder and a second violent crime committed while armed would be eligible for Youth Act sentencing. Rolark's committee passed the bill 3 to 1. John Ray, now a lawyer, was the lone no vote.    John Ray, now an attorney, talks about the Youth Rehabilitation Act in the District. (Linda   Washington Post)  “I consider myself a liberal, but I put those three as left of liberalism,” Ray said. “I grew up in Georgia, and everyone around me was poor, but I didn't  —   and still don't  —   accept the position that you should get a pass for violent crime because you're poor or you didn't come from the best family. I think people must be held responsible for their conduct. ” On July 11, 1985, the council passed the bill, 9 to 4, with Ray (D) having registered his protest, flipping his vote. Barry signed it into law that month. But in the late 1990s, facing the threat of bankruptcy, D. C. officials agreed to a federal bailout that transferred supervision of inmates to the federal government. The Lorton Youth Center closed, and D. C. prisoners were dispersed across the country to federal prisons, where there were no rehabilitation programs expressly targeting them. Eric H. Holder Jr. then a deputy U. S. attorney general, led a commission reviewing all D. C. criminal laws to bring them in line with federal statutes. “No other single issue provoked as much debate in the Commission as did the Youth Act,” the commission said in 1998. Commission members were concerned about judges' using the Youth Act to override mandatory minimums and considered banning the act for violent offenders. “Several commissioners observed that the inclusion of violent youthful offenders destroyed the federal Youth Corrections Act and was wreaking havoc on the D. C. Youth Rehabilitation Act,” the commission wrote. Like all federal inmates, Youth Act offenders would now be required to serve 85 percent of their sentences. But the commission ultimately decided not to take a position on violent offenders. In 2000,  . C. Council member Harold Brazil (D) lobbied for a sentencing reform act that would have excluded most violent felons from the Youth Act. “The Youth Act makes sense for less serious crimes,” Brazil said then. “For the heinous stuff, well, it's just not going to do much good. ” The Public Defender Service argued that young black men would be irreparably harmed. “If this bill passes as adopted, it will almost certainly increase incarceration rates and racial disparities in the District's criminal justice system,” wrote Robert Wilkins, chief of special litigation for the service, in an   in The Post. Wilkins is now a judge on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The law was once again left intact.    Inmates in the south end hallway of the District's Central Detention Facility. (Linda   Washington Post)  ‘They're just letting you off' About half of the young offenders in the age group eligible for Youth Act sentences  —   those younger than 22  —   receive them. Youth Act sentences account for about 15 percent of all felony sentences in D. C. Superior Court. Prosecutors and defense attorneys turn to the law to make plea deals. The Public Defender Service's manual highlights the Youth Act as a way to get around mandatory prison time for certain violent gun crimes. To ensure at least some prison time in an unpredictable legal system, prosecutors negotiating plea deals often agree to not oppose the application of the Youth Act. “If you try to prosecute a case that is not built on strong evidence, and that defendant is subsequently exonerated, all you have done is emboldened that defendant to believe he can always beat the system,” said Ronald C. Machen Jr. who was U. S. attorney in the District from 2010 to 2015. “He will feel like he is a Teflon Don. ” D. C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) faults prosecutors as willing to offer generous deals to violent criminals. “When they dumb down the charges, over and over, they are missing what's necessary to put the violent repeat offender away,” he said. Judges are given wide leeway to apply the law. In some cases, judges order inmates at the jail to undergo lengthy evaluations, known as “Youth Act studies. ” The evaluations include interviews with psychologists or social workers. If defendants are not in jail, judges can allow defense attorneys to hire their own experts to conduct the studies. Judges also are authorized to give Youth Act sentences without ordering studies.    Antwon Pitt (Prince George's County state's attorney's office)  Youth Act studies are not made public. The Public Defender Service, D. C. Superior Court judges and jail officials denied requests from The Post to review studies. In 2013, Antwon Pitt was under consideration for a Youth Act sentence after pleading guilty to robbing a D. C. woman and assaulting a police officer. He had already been convicted of aggravated assault and battery in a different case and had received a Youth Act sentence for a misdemeanor. Pitt's defense attorney argued that he should be eligible for benefits under the law because the author of Pitt's Youth Act study recommended that approach. “I know,” Judge Heidi Pasichow said. “It's very rare that people are not recommended, but he's violent. ” Ultimately, she sentenced Pitt to the statutory minimum for robbery  —   24 months  —   to be served in prison, and gave him a chance to have his record expunged under the Youth Act. About two months after his release from prison, Pitt committed a brutal rape during a home invasion in the Hill East neighborhood of the District. He has since been convicted and sentenced to 60 years in prison.  Pasichow declined to comment for this story. No study was done for William Smallwood, who benefited from the Youth Act twice  —   once in an assault case, then in a robbery case  —   before he killed a man about a year and a half later, at age 22.    Rashard Raigns (Metropolitan Police Department)  He pleaded guilty to the   murder of Rashard Raigns and was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Smallwood, during a prison interview in West Virginia, said he was surprised that he was twice sentenced under the Youth Act without any evaluation. “The Youth Act is not what it's cracked up to be,” he told The Post. “They're just letting you off. But you're not getting any help. ” A spokesman from the Bureau of Prisons told The Post that the agency realizes the “greater vulnerability” of young adults and works with Youth Act offenders to develop personalized goals to prepare them for a “productive and lasting return to the community. ” Not all judges embrace the Youth Act. Judge Jennifer Anderson, who was hearing a 2010 case involving a defendant who reached for a loaded gun and struggled with police officers, denied his request for the Youth Act. She said the defendant's conduct was not “a single, isolated event attributable to youthful indiscretion, which is the type of case that is appropriate for the benefit of the Youth Rehabilitation Act in this court's opinion. ” This year, criminal justice officials in the District met with The Post's editorial board and a group of Post reporters to defend the system in the aftermath of the Pitt case. During the meeting, Judge Leibovitz, head of the Superior Court's criminal division, characterized the Youth Act as simply a way for offenders to have their records expunged if they do not get in trouble again. “It's words on a page, unless and until the person is successful,” she said. Leibovitz disputed the idea that Youth Act sentences equate to leniency. She said the court does not keep statistics on Youth Act sentences that go below mandatory minimums. The Post's review of 136   sentences under the Youth Act showed that, on average, they were two years less than regular   sentences. The Post found at least 20   cases committed with guns that resulted in Youth Act sentences below the   mandatory minimum since 2010. An additional 35   cases included the stipulation in plea deals that imitation guns were used in the commission of the crimes. Those deals sometimes were contradicted by sworn statements from the defendants that described their possession of real guns. The Post found one case in which a man convicted of   murder, Kurtis Faison, was sentenced under the Youth Act, although the law expressly prohibits the inclusion of convicted murderers. Judges and prosecutors declined to comment on the legality of the 2013 sentence issued by Judge Henry Greene. ‘  quarterback' Interim D. C. Metropolitan Police Chief Peter Newsham said community members are often frustrated when they see violent criminals return to the streets.    Bijon Brown (Courtesy of Metro Transit Police)  “They will look to the police and ask us, ‘What the heck happened?' ” he said. “And that can be frustrating for our officers. ” Newsham said he thinks repeat violent offenders illustrate how the criminal justice system has failed to protect the public. “Someone, somewhere along the line, should have done something to prevent that from happening,” he said. The Post identified more than 200 criminals who received Youth Act sentences more than once for weapons offenses or violent crimes in the past decade. In February 2015, Bijon Brown lived in Forest Ridge, a public housing complex in Southeast Washington where   numbers mark the apartment buildings. A short hike down a hill leads to the turf of a rival neighborhood crew. On a Monday morning on Presidents' Day, Brown confronted two teenage boys near a small basketball court. He opened fire, striking one of them in the leg. Brown later admitted to the shooting and told police officers that he had thrown the gun into the Anacostia River. Brown's defense attorney said there had been an ongoing neighborhood feud. The attorney said Brown had only been trying to scare the boys.    Judge Anita   (Michael   The Washington Post)  “I understand I made a mistake and all that, but, I'm just trying to get my life in order, that's all,” Brown told Judge  . Brown pleaded guilty to attempted assault with a dangerous weapon. The prosecutor and defense attorney agreed on a   sentence, with all time suspended. Prosecutor Scott Ray said in court filings that Brown had accepted responsibility for his actions and had saved the system considerable resources by swiftly taking the plea deal. The prosecutor did not oppose the Youth Act for Brown's case. The judge gave Brown the   sentence and placed him on probation under the Youth Act. “The hope is that, you know, this will be the last time that we all see you and that you will have a productive life,” the judge said. On Aug. 21, 2015  —   29 days into his probation  —   Brown opened fire aboard a Metrobus after a rival neighborhood crew surrounded the bus. The shooting was captured on video, and police quickly identified him as a suspect. After the identification, Mayor Bowser held a news conference to put a spotlight on Brown. “These are the folks that are driving a lot of the crime in the District,” she said, questioning why he had been released so quickly. Three weeks later, police officers found Brown hiding in a friend's closet. He pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm, with an agreement that prosecutors would not request more than 15 months' incarceration. This time, prosecutors opposed giving Brown the Youth Act. “He took that entire bus full of people and he took them into a battle zone,” prosecutor William Schurmann said. Brown told the judge that he planned to turn his life around and move away from his violent neighborhood once he was released from jail. “The picture has been painted of me that maybe I am a monster or I am somebody that may just want to carry around guns shooting at people,” he told   in April. “I just want to let everybody know that I am not the monster that everybody looks at me to be. ”   sentenced him to a year and a day in jail under the Youth Act. By August 2016, Brown was out of jail, with credit applied for the time he had already served. Nine days after Brown's release, a man reported that he had been held at gunpoint during a carjacking near the Rhode Island Avenue Metro station in Northeast Washington. Later, during a police chase, the fleeing car crashed into a front yard, and its three occupants fled. Brown was caught. He was charged with unauthorized use of a vehicle. His case is pending. In September,   took a moment on the bench to reflect on Brown's past sentencings. She cast blame on the juvenile victims of the first shooting, saying they had been “terrorizing” the neighborhood. Then she said the Metrobus shooting had looked like “something out of ‘Straight Outta Compton' ” because of the “mob” of men that confronted Brown. “I really think it is easy to   quarterback judges as we are making decisions that have more context,” she said, staring at a Post reporter taking notes in the courtroom. “Because otherwise, you just get a computer and it spits out a sentence. ”   declined a Post request to comment on the Brown case. ‘He's 19 years old' On Oct. 3, 2013, Mikiyas Getachew took a taxi to his home in Northeast Washington. It was about 2:45 a. m. and as he fumbled with his key to open the door, he felt the barrel of a gun against the back of his head.    The former residence of Mikiyas Getachew and his family in Northeast Washington, where they were robbed at gunpoint in 2013. (Linda   Washington Post)  He looked up to see men in ski masks. They took his wallet, Tag Heuer watch and cellphone. They forced him to unlock the door, pushing him inside. The commotion awoke his mother and his fiancee, Nava. The robbers held them at gunpoint on their knees. The men carried televisions out of bedrooms, grabbed laptops and took Nava's $5, 000 engagement ring. The men loaded the items into the victims' cars, a Nissan Altima and a Honda CRV, and took off. The men set the vehicles ablaze six miles away, behind a shuttered school in Southeast. Later that day, D. C. police surrounded an abandoned house a few blocks away from where the vehicles were set alight and found the suspects and goods stolen from the Getachew home. The man prosecutors said had the gun at the start of the crime, Andre Townsend, then 19, was on pretrial release in a case in which he allegedly assaulted two young men with a handgun. Getachew pleaded for harsh penalties for the perpetrators: “What we would like to see is justice being served to the fullest against these defendants. ” Nava and Mikiyas Getachew never found the engagement ring. They have since moved away from the District. If Townsend had been convicted of all 18 charges against him, he could have faced 29 to 65 years under sentencing guidelines. Prosecutors said Townsend had expressed remorse. They offered a plea that dropped 14 of 18 charges, including three of armed kidnapping.    Judge William Jackson (Michael   The Washington Post)  But prosecutor Ben Schrader told Judge William Jackson that the Youth Act was not appropriate for Townsend. “This is not a   robbery case,” he said. “It's a concerted effort by a group of people to commit a pretty heinous act. ” Defense attorney Kelli Neptune said the authors of a Youth Act study had recommended that Townsend receive the benefits of the law. “The Youth Act is given even in homicide cases,” she told Judge Jackson. Townsend said he wanted to speak. “I want to say I apologize to the victim and my family, and that's it,” Townsend said. Judge Jackson said he thought the sentence in the plea deal reached between the defense and the prosecution was light, but he accepted it. He sentenced Townsend to 48 months for armed burglary and 48 months for armed robbery, to be served consecutively. Although the judge said it was a “very close” decision, he decided to apply the Youth Act to Townsend, who is to be released in 2020. “He's 19 years old,” Jackson said. “So, that's why I'm doing it. ” Shareem Hall, whose fingerprints were found at the scene of the crime, accepted responsibility for his actions and pleaded guilty to several charges, including conspiracy to commit a crime of violence while armed, which carries a mandatory prison term of at least five years. “I want to say that I'm truly, truly sorry to the victims. . . . I just pray that they forgive me,” the    said to Judge Jackson in 2015. “I no longer want to take from people anymore. ” Invoking the Youth Act, Jackson suspended Hall's entire   prison sentence and set him free on probation. Earlier this year, police identified Hall as a suspect in the slaying of Dodds, the transgender woman shot during an attempted robbery on July 4 in Northeast Washington. Hall and a   now face the charge of “  murder while   murder. ” Their preliminary hearings are scheduled for Dec. 9. When police caught up with Hall in September, he was wearing a gray backpack. Inside, police said, was a Smith & Wesson .  handgun loaded with 10 rounds of ammunition.  Washington Post researchers Jennifer Jenkins, Alice Crites and Magda   and graduate students Shaun Courtney and Teaganne Finn, contributed to this report. Courtney and Finn are attached to The Post's investigative unit through a program at American University.   How The Post studied the Youth Rehabilitation Act  To study the implementation of the District's Youth Rehabilitation Act, The Washington Post drew from a number of sources, combining information where possible for a more complete understanding of the effects of the law. The Post requested and received a data set from the D. C. Sentencing Commission containing all 3, 188 felony sentences issued under the Youth Act from January 2010 to April 2016. The data did not contain information on the identities of those sentenced but included the ages of offenders, dates of conviction, charges at conviction and a statistical weighting of their criminal histories. The Post wrote software to search the Districts's online court database to identify all publicly available criminal cases, felony and misdemeanor, 168, 265 between January 2007 and November 2016. The Post then pulled docket information on every case and analyzed the data, identifying all felony and misdemeanor crimes sentenced under the Youth Act that have not been expunged. By matching crimes and sentencing dates to the Sentencing Commission's data, The Post was able to identify 85 percent of the 3, 188 felony offenders sentenced under the Youth Act since 2010. The Post also identified upward of 3, 000 misdemeanor crimes for which sentences were given under the Youth Act. Because the Sentencing Commission does not track these crimes, reporters could not determine how many convictions have been expunged because sentences have been successfully completed. The Post also requested data on those arrested on homicide charges in the District since 2010 from the Metropolitan Police Department. Using data pulled from the District's court website, reporters identified 121 individuals arrested on homicide charges who previously were sentenced under the Youth Act. Reporters verified the identity of each offender by pulling files at D. C. Superior Court. "
145486,217370,"U.S. economy added 178,000 jobs in November; unemployment rate dropped to 4.6 percent",Washington Post,Ana Swanson,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161203001010/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/02/u-s-economy-added-178000-jobs-in-november-unemployment-rate-drops-to-4-6-percent/
","     The U. S. economy added 178, 000 jobs in November, while the unemployment rate fell to 4. 6 percent, a level not seen since August 2007, according to government data released Friday morning. The first employment report since voters went to the polls last month shows an economy in strong shape as   Trump prepares to take office. “It looks like firms are pretty bullish about what they're going to see in 2017 and are continuing their strong hiring of the past few years,” said Steve Rick, chief economist at insurance company CUNA Mutual Group. “This is a good tailwind for the new administration. ”   Democrats seized on the report as evidence that Obama had cultivated a much more robust economy that Trump would now take over. “It is hard to imagine a more stark contrast between the economy that we are passing off to our successor and the economy we inherited,” said Christopher Lu, the deputy secretary of the Labor Department. The data comes a day after Trump celebrated a deal in Indiana to preserve about 1, 000 jobs at a furnace factory run by Carrier, a unit of United Technologies, saying he planned to intervene more frequently in corporate decisions to move jobs overseas. Carrier had planned to move a factory to Mexico, but partially relented under pressure from Trump and a $7 million tax subsidy from the state. On a conference call on Friday morning, a Trump transition team spokesperson called the decline in manufacturing jobs, wages and the labor force participation rate in November evidence of Obama's failures, but said Americans were already looking forward to Trump's economic stewardship. “What we're starting to see now is a new sense of optimism,” said spokesman Jason Miller. “This incoming administration is one that is going to fight even before formally taking office to keep American jobs.”  Data released on Friday showed a sharp drop in the unemployment rate from 4. 9 percent the previous month, driven partly by the creation of new jobs and partly by people retiring and otherwise leaving the labor force. A broader measure of unemployment, the   rate, which includes those who have given up looking for work and   workers who would like to have   jobs, fell to 9. 3 percent, the lowest reading since April 2008. The figure still remains elevated from average levels in the 2000s. Average hourly earnings declined by 3 cents to $25. 89, paring back large gains in October. That drop surprised some economists, who were expecting a tighter labor market to continue to translate into wage gains for workers. But economists cautioned that    changes can be volatile and that, over the year, average hourly earnings are up 2. 5 percent. The report was largely in line with investor expectations, and stock markets were down slightly in   trading. Revisions to the job figures for September and October did not significantly alter previous data, removing only 2, 000 jobs in total.  The release comes ahead of the Federal Reserve's Dec.   meeting, when the central bank is expected to announce its first interest rate increase in a year. Although wages fell slightly in November, many economists view the steady wage gains of the earlier months as a sign that a tightening labor market is allowing workers to demand higher pay, increasing pressure on the Fed to head off inflation by hiking interest rates. Trump has promised to spend heavily to rebuild America's infrastructure. If realized, the plan would likely add more jobs to business payrolls and boost spending, consumer confidence and inflationary pressure throughout the economy. Trump surged to an electoral victory largely on the support of white,   voters fearful of job losses, especially in   industries like manufacturing and mining. He has pledged to restore   manufacturing jobs to the USA. That promise could be difficult to achieve, given the continuing trend toward automation and   shift of the economy away from manufacturing and toward the service sector, said Jed Kolko, chief economist at job search site Indeed.  In November, construction, professional and business services, and health care were among the   sectors of the economy, but manufacturing industry jobs declined compared with the previous month and one year ago. “To bring back manufacturing jobs means overcoming some pretty strong headwinds,” said Kolko. The jobs report contained further clues that Americans with skills and education are having little trouble finding work, but that those without continue to struggle. The unemployment rate for Americans with a bachelor's degree or higher dipped to 2. 3 percent in November, but the rate for those with less than a   diploma rose to 7. 9 percent. “When you drill down into the data [for] more educated workers, you see an unemployment rate that's pretty nice, and in recovery mode,” said Beth Ann Bovino, U. S. chief economist at S&P Global.  “But people with a high school education are still really hurting. That's certainly a concern for them and their families, but also the recovery going forward. ” The November jobs report was also one of the final snapshots of the economy under Obama's administration. The picture was dramatically different from Obama's first months in the White House, when the private sector was shedding roughly 800, 000 jobs a month and the unemployment rate was at 10 percent. During Obama's term as president, the U. S. economy “went from being in intensive care to walking under its own power,” said Mark Hamrick, Bankrate. com's senior economic analyst. “It might even be jogging at this point. ”      America's monthly jobs report can be hard to understand. Here's what you need to know about   payroll employment and the unemployment rate —  with gummy bears to help explain. (Kate M. Tobey, Gillian Brockell, Jhaan   Washington Post)   "

","      The tattered Pearl Harbor survivor looks every bit of 78, with weathered skin, rusty bones and the faded “U. S. Navy” emblem the old bird got before the war. Gray from age and years in the service, the veteran of Dec. 7 sits with other World War II antiques, weary and in need of attention. But with the 75th anniversary of the 1941 attack this week, and commemorations scheduled in Hawaii and around the country, this survivor, like most who were there that day, has a story. The ungainly Navy airplane at the National Air and Space Museum's   Center in Chantilly, Va. is one of the few original U. S. aircraft in existence that flew against the Japanese armada that day. Then painted silver and   with a bright green tail and red trim, it was an unlikely combatant. Designed as a small airliner  —   a “baby clipper”  —   it was unarmed and part of a unit called Utility Squadron One, which hauled mail, sailors and Navy photographers around the Hawaiian Islands. It had window curtains and a restroom with porcelain fixtures. Its top speed was just over 100 mph. With Pearl Harbor a scene of death and devastation that Sunday morning, Plane No. 1063  —   its insignia a pelican carrying a mailbag  —   was ordered to seek out the enemy. For armament, the    pilot, Ensign Wesley Hoyt Ruth, and his   crew were issued three World War   rifles. Their task: Report the location of the six Japanese aircraft carriers, two battleships, assorted escort ships and hundreds of enemy airplanes that had been involved in the attack. “This is going to be a   trip,” Ruth later said he thought. But it wasn't.     An old drinking water kit was in the Sikorsky   flying boat that sits in the restoration hangar of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. (Jahi   Washington Post)     Lockbox keys also were found on the plane, which had a   hull to allow it land on water and wheels to come in on a runway. (Jahi   Washington Post)      years later, the Sikorsky   amphibian, with its boat hull for the water and big tires for the runway, sits in the   Center's restoration hangar, a venerable witness to the event that helped create modern America. The Pearl Harbor attack, which plunged the USA into World War II, killed an estimated 2, 400 Americans, wounded about 1, 100, and destroyed ships, planes and facilities. “The fact that [Ruth] got out and got back is . . . absolutely amazing,” Smithsonian museum specialist Pat Robinson said last month.  The plane would not have survived an encounter with the Japanese fleet, which it did not find, Robinson said in an interview at the center. It was lucky not to have been shot down by jumpy American antiaircraft gunners when it returned to Pearl Harbor, he said. And it was a miracle that it was saved from the postwar scrap heap. “Somewhere . . . someone looking at the log books realized the significance of the airplane, and where it had been,” and alerted the Smithsonian, which retrieved it from military storage, Robinson said.  “It's a huge deal, to have this here,” he said. “It represents American involvement in the Second World War. It was there when it started. ”   Indeed, the airplane has a presence, and the Smithsonian would one day like to restore it. But other historic planes are in line ahead of it.  The craft, constructed for the Navy in 1938 at the Sikorsky plant in Stratford, Conn. is big, with the two huge propeller engines built into the wing above the fuselage, a hatch in the nose where a photographer could stand, and   windows. Inside it, the curators found an old emergency water purification kit and the rusted keys to a lockbox in the radio compartment. The squadron was based on Ford Island, in the middle of Pearl Harbor, where the Navy's doomed battleships were parked. Ruth, the pilot, who later lived in the Washington area and taught at the Bullis School in Potomac, Md. was in his bachelor's quarters on the island the morning of the attack.

He died last year at age 101 and is buried in Arlington Cemetery. (Family photo) (   Photo)  A seasoned aviator, “he could fly anything,” his son, Thomas A. Ruth II, said recently. A native of tiny De Smet, S. D. he was having breakfast when the Japanese planes came roaring in. He thought for a moment that it might be a drill, until he saw them dropping bombs.  “Then I knew for sure that we were in for trouble,” he said. He would survive the war, but a younger brother, Thomas, who was also a Navy pilot, was shot down and killed in the South Pacific in 1943. In videotaped accounts he gave over the years, Wes Ruth said he grabbed his coat that morning, jumped into his convertible and sped with the top down for the airstrip. “I drove as fast as I could because . . . I was concerned about getting strafed,” he said. As he neared the runway, the battleship USS Arizona had just blown up about a   away. Pellets of gunpowder ejected from the blast began to fall from the sky. “It was snowing powder pellets about as large as my finger,” Ruth said in a talk he gave in 2011. They fell in and around his car.  As the Japanese attack ended, the Americans wanted to locate the fleet from which the enemy planes had come. Ruth was ordered to go find it. “You take the first plane, the JRS,” he said a senior officer told him.  He got into the plane with   Emery C. “Pappy” Geise, 35, radioman Oscar W. Benenfiel Jr. plane captain Amos P. Gallupe and two other sailors, according to the Smithsonian.  Before they left, the senior officer presented them with three old Springfield rifles for protection. “We would have to shoot through the windows,” Ruth said.  He thought the chances of surviving were zero. The brightly colored plane took off and flew north, looking for the enemy. Hours went by. “Every second in the air was fraught with anxiety, apprehension, [and] anger,” a crewman on another search plane recalled, according to Pearl Harbor historian Craig Nelson. “If ever there was a suicide mission, this was one. ”  Ruth said he flew just beneath the clouds, so he could duck into the cloud cover if there was trouble. He flew 250 miles to the north but saw nothing. He turned east for 10 miles, then headed back south 250 miles toward Pearl Harbor. Still nothing. Although the enemy fleet was still lurking north of Pearl Harbor, Ruth and his crew made no contact. But then they had to get back to Ford Island without getting shot down by their comrades. Numerous American planes were mistaken for the enemy and shot at by nervous Americans on the ground, according to historians. Again, Ruth and his men were lucky. They arrived unscathed.  Following the attack, the plane was moved to a base in California and later handed over to the forerunner of NASA for testing purposes, Robinson said. After that it went into storage until its importance was noticed and it was given to the Smithsonian. Ruth died last year at 101 in Matthews, N. C. He was buried in January in Arlington National Cemetery. For his actions at Pearl Harbor, he was given the Navy Cross, the service's   decoration for heroism. “Although contact with the enemy meant almost certain destruction,” his citation reads, Ruth's courage, airmanship and skill “were at all times inspiring and in keeping with the highest traditions of the USA Naval Service. ” "

","        There is limited space to dry fish in Elmina, so they are dried on the ground. (Tomasz Tomaszewski)  Editor's note: Quotes and captions have been edited for clarity. Elmina is a picturesque, historic fishing community dating back to the 1400s. It is one of the first European settlements in West Africa located on the   bay on the Atlantic Ocean coast of Ghana. While passing through Elmina, photographer Tomasz Tomaszewski was intrigued by the beautiful landscape and the coastal fisherman's artisanal way of life. So he went there to document what he saw. Here's what he had to say about his experience: It was some years ago when I was passing through Elmina on the way to a neighboring country, Benin, to take some pictures of an interesting celebration there. While crossing the bridge in Elmina, I was seduced by the view of the bay and hundreds of fisherman in their boats. I cultivated this image in me for months and months, and couldn't get over it, so I collected money and a year later I traveled to Elmina for five days to take a closer look at this magical place. It was a very personal project. I wanted to experience a place that made a strong impression on me. From afar, the town looked like a big anthill, pulsing with hundreds of people, including children that were fishing. They catch fish and then sell to buyers, who then deliver the fish to bigger cities. They dry the fish themselves. All of the work is done in a kind of communal way with everyone involved, including the children. There is a fish market next to the shore where all negotiations take place. Hundreds of people buy and sell fresh fish there.  The people of Elmina are bravely fighting for their survival and existence as they face the increase of modern technology in the fishing industry, and despite the aggressive behavior of Chinese fishermen. They support themselves by creating small cooperatives, where profits are shared equally between the members of these communities. It is a   effort without any aid from the state. See more of Tomasz Tomaszewski's work here.    Fishermen pull boats out of the water before high tide. Families fish and care for their boats together and share the income from the day's catch. (Tomasz Tomaszewski)     The local fishermen use simple equipment and fish near the shore. This limits the size of the fish they catch. This large fish is an exception. (Tomasz Tomaszewski)     Women bring fresh fruit to the fishermen while they work the nets. (Tomasz Tomaszewski)     Kids play on the beach while they wait for their parents to return from fishing. (Tomasz Tomaszewski)     Boats are built in a Marina. They are made only of wood. No modern materials are used. (Tomasz Tomaszewski)     Fishermen work out at a local gym. They need to build strength to maneuver the boats and nets while fishing. (Tomasz Tomaszewski)     Kids wait at the Marina for the fishermen to return.

145495,217383,Trump's demagogic illogic strikes again,Washington Post,Kathleen Parker,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161204005809/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-demagogic-illogic-strikes-again/2016/12/02/3677aea4-b8cc-11e6-959c-172c82123976_story.html
"," On the first stop of his “thank you” tour in Ohio on Thursday,   Trump hit replay on several of his campaign tropes. Among the crowd pleasers, he heckled the “crooked media,” prompting boos from the audience, and reiterated his pledge to criminalize flag burning. And he's not even president yet. More than a month and a half away from Inauguration Day, Trump's only discipline seems to be making good on bad faith. His attacks both on the media and on those who, rather rarely, burn an American flag, are fundamentally assaults on the Constitution and the First Amendment. Do Trump followers really not care about these founding documents and their bearing on all the freedoms we take for granted? Or, could they really not know any better?  Most disturbing is the absence of objections from the right. Where are the Republicans when the leader of their party speaks so dismissively toward our principles of freedom and the journalists, many of whom they know personally, who practice in good faith the spirit of the law? How long before Trump's words persuade some   Second Amendment “patriot” to take out a “crooked” media person, fully expecting to be applauded by the  ?  We the people believe in free speech and a free press not so that we can burn flags but so that we can expose government corruption, protest oppression and express opinions that others may find disagreeable without fear of repercussion. As offensive as flag burning is to patriotic Americans, it also can be an act of patriotism, a proposition I offer as argument, not endorsement. If you love your country and fear that it's being led toward tyranny, you might well burn a flag to demonstrate such concerns. To the extent that the flag is a symbol of freedom, burning it is also a symbolic act. I would argue that many if not most veterans, including those in my family, fought, suffered and died for the right of all Americans to speak freely.  Indeed, it is the objectionable expression that is the true test of the strength of our freedoms. We don't need a First Amendment to protect   cards or love letters. We don't need it to protect Christmas carols. But should someone challenge the latter, given its religious content, wouldn't many of those Ohioans cheering Trump's demagogic illogic be grateful that free speech protects their right to stroll the streets singing songs of praise? Understanding the crucial importance of free speech and a free press to all other freedoms compelled the Supreme Court to rule that even flag burning is protected. And this is why Trump, a man who professes to love freedom and has presented himself as the best person to lead the free world, should be roundly condemned for suggesting that anyone who burns a flag should be punished by imprisonment or even loss of citizenship. Or why his persistent attacks on the media, threatening to restrict press freedom, are so misplaced, potentially dangerous and, not least, impossible for him to do constitutionally. Either Trump knows this, which makes his   not only offensive but also irresponsible, or he's unfamiliar with the Constitution, the defense of which is one of the primary functions of the presidency. As to the crooked media, Trump's gibes are patently ludicrous. Was he  ? Perhaps, but he was early on the Republican   and subsequently the nominee. The media could hardly ignore him, much as many of us would have liked to. Yes, some members of the media are biased, but not most, and they're usually drummed out through peer review.  It should be obvious that without the   mainstream media, especially newspapers such as the NY Times and The Post, no one would know anything that has any basis in objective fact  —   and yes there is such a thing. We will rue the day we forgot that newsgathering is a profession with demanding standards regarding performance and ethics. Notwithstanding the   global newsroom, it's nice to have smart,   experienced reporters and editors to pluck the pearls from the muck. Therefore, the highest service the president of the USA could perform would be to actively engage the media in the national interest of nurturing an informed populace, without which a democratic Republic cannot long survive.  To do otherwise is the first act of the dictator.  Read more from Kathleen Parker's archive, follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook.

"," Welcome to  —   brace yourself for  —   the   presidency. “Facts are stubborn things,” said John Adams in 1770, defending British soldiers accused in the Boston Massacre, “and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence. ” Or so we thought, until we elected to the presidency a man consistently heedless of truth and impervious to  . Oxford Dictionaries last month selected    —   “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief”  —   as the international word of the year, and for good reason.  The practice of    —   untrue assertion piled on untrue assertion  —   helped get Trump to the White House. The more untruths he told, the more supporters rewarded him for, as they saw it, telling it like it is.  As Politico's Susan Glasser wrote in a sobering assessment of election coverage for the Brookings Institution, “Even   perhaps the most untruthful candidate of our lifetime didn't work; the more news outlets did it, the less the facts resonated. ”  Indeed, Hannah Arendt, writing in 1967, presciently explained the basis for this phenomenon: “Since the liar is free to fashion his ‘facts' to fit the profit and pleasure, or even the mere expectations, of his audience, the chances are that he will be more persuasive than the truth teller. ”  So there is no reason to think Trump is about to suddenly  . Indeed, all signs are to the contrary  —   most glaringly Trump's    tweet that “I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally. ”  Trump and his aides are not embarrassed by their    —   they embrace it. Three data points from last week: First,   Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski at Harvard University, making the astonishing assertion that the media's failing during the campaign was not that it scorned Trump  —   it was that it believed him. “You guys took everything that Trump said so literally,” he said. “The American people didn't. They understood it. They understood that sometimes  —   when you have a conversation with people . . . you're going to say things, and sometimes you don't have all the facts to back it up. ” Second, this   assertion from Trump   commentator Scottie Nell Hughes on the Diane Rehm Show: “People that say that facts are facts  —   they're not really facts . . . there's no such thing, unfortunately, anymore of facts. And so Mr. Trump's tweet amongst a certain crowd . . . are truth. ”  Finally, the   himself, who at a rally to celebrate his successful bribing of Carrier to keep some jobs in the USA, explained that he was impelled to act by a   supporter who had been naive enough to take Trump's promises seriously.  Watching the evening news, Trump said, he saw the Carrier worker say “‘No, we're not leaving, because Trump promised us that we're not leaving,' and I never thought I made that promise. Not with Carrier. ” Then, Trump said, “they played my statement, and I said, ‘Carrier will never leave.' But that was a euphemism. I was talking about Carrier like all other companies from here on in. ” This was a telling moment, and not just because Trump doesn't quite understand what euphemism means. The episode simultaneously shows Trump, confronted with Trump on tape, willing to recognize reality and Trump telling us straightforwardly that his promises are not to be taken seriously. They are truthphemisms.  Of course, Trump is not the first   president. Ronald Reagan famously insisted on repeating tall tales; he conflated Hollywood with reality. “If you tell the same story five times it's true,” said White House press secretary Larry Speakes.   And Arendt reminded us a   century ago about the inherent tensions between   and political power: “No one has ever doubted that truth and politics are on rather bad terms with each other, and no one, as far as I know, has ever counted truthfulness among the political virtues. ”  But today we have the conjunction of a president unconstrained by facts with a media environment both siloed into partisan echo chambers and polluted by fake news. This development poses an urgent challenge  —   for journalism and for democracy. The journalist's challenge is not to tire in refuting the torrent of lies. The citizen's challenge is to remain vigilant against the enticing lure of   politics, to recall the admonition of our second president even as our 45th seeks to prove his wisdom an outmoded relic of a    era.

"," The word “inappropriate” is increasingly used inappropriately. It is useful to describe departures from good manners and other social norms, such as wearing white after Labor Day and using the salad fork with the entree. But the adjective has become a splatter of verbal fudge, a weasel word falsely suggesting measured seriousness. Its misty imprecision does not disguise but advertises the user's moral obtuseness.  A French court has demonstrated how “inappropriate” can be an   device of intellectual evasion and moral cowardice. The court said it is inappropriate to do something that might disturb people who killed their unborn babies for reasons that were, shall we say, inappropriate. Prenatal genetic testing enables pregnant women to be apprised of a variety of problems with their unborn babies, including Down syndrome. It is a congenital condition resulting from a chromosomal defect that causes varying degrees of mental disability and some physical abnormalities, such as low muscle tone, small stature, flatness of the back of the head and an upward slant to the eyes. Within living memory, Down syndrome people were called Mongoloids. Now they are included in the category called “special needs” people. What they most need is nothing special. It is for people to understand their aptitudes, and to therefore quit killing them in utero. Down syndrome, although not common, is among the most common congenital anomalies at 49. 7 per 100, 000 births. In approximately 90 percent of instances when prenatal genetic testing reveals Down syndrome, the baby is aborted. Cleft lips or palates, which occur in 72. 6 per 100, 000 births, also can be diagnosed in utero and sometimes are the reason a baby is aborted.  In 2014, in conjunction with World Down Syndrome Day (March 21) the Global Down Syndrome Foundation prepared a   video titled “Dear Future Mom” to assuage the anxieties of pregnant women who have learned that they are carrying a Down syndrome baby. More than 7 million people have seen the video online in which one such woman says, “I'm scared: What kind of life will my child have?” Down syndrome children from many nations tell the woman that her child will hug, speak, go to school, tell you he loves you and “can be happy, just like I am  —   and you'll be happy, too. ” The French state is not happy about this. The court has ruled that the video is  —   wait for it  —   “inappropriate” for French television. The court upheld a ruling in which the French Broadcasting Council had banned the video as a commercial. The court said the video's depiction of happy Down syndrome children was “likely to disturb the conscience of women who had lawfully made different personal life choices. ” So, what happens on campuses does not stay on campuses. There, in many nations, sensitivity bureaucracies have been enforcing the relatively new entitlement to be shielded from whatever might disturb, even inappropriate jokes. And now this rapidly metastasizing right has come to this: A video that accurately communicates a truthful proposition  —   that Down syndrome people can be happy and give happiness  —   should be suppressed because some people might become ambivalent, or morally queasy, about having chosen to extinguish such lives because . . .   This is why the video giving facts about Down syndrome people is so subversive of the flaccid consensus among those who say aborting a baby is of no more moral significance than removing a tumor from a stomach. Pictures persuade. Today's improved prenatal sonograms make graphic the fact that the moving fingers and beating heart are not mere “fetal material. ” They are a baby. Toymaker   children's apparel manufacturer OshKosh, McDonald's and Target have featured Down syndrome children in ads that the French court would probably ban from television. The court has said, in effect, that the lives of Down syndrome people  —   and by inescapable implication, the lives of many other disabled people  —   matter less than the serenity of people who have acted on one or more of three vicious principles: That the lives of the disabled are not worth living. Or that the lives of the disabled are of negligible value next to the desire of parents to have a child who has no special, meaning inconvenient, needs. Or that government should suppress the voices of Down syndrome children in order to guarantee other people's right not to be disturbed by reminders that they have made lethal choices on the basis of one or both of the first two inappropriate principles.

King,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161204005809/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-districts-government-is-a-costly-laboratory-for-the-left/2016/12/02/4028d3ca-b7db-11e6-959c-172c82123976_story.html
","   The D. C. Council, having relegated the mission of   oversight to a back seat, has become a legislative laboratory for the left  ” with the resultant costs to be borne by District taxpayers. Let us pause, draw nigh to council chambers and listen to the scream of protest:   Vigorous oversight of D. C. government operations is essential to our being. ‰ Tis a duty we cherish above all. ?  Rather than actively overseeing the operation of city programs and services, our legislators seem bent on taking revenge upon what they apparently regard as a scourge of the earth: D. C. business. Of course, that s not the way council members would put it. They fancy themselves providers of social justice and economic security and defenders against the rich and powerful. They point with pride toward their legislative gems: a paid   plan and the recently passed   bill.  In truth, the  good ? in these measures comes in the elevation of the council s   as a progressive national leader.  Consider:   â —  ? The paid   plan provides 11 weeks off, with up to 90Â percent pay  ” the most generous such law in the land;   â —  ? The $15 hourly minimum wage will be among the highest minimum wages in the nation by the end of the decade. Yeah, our council is No. 1.  This is a win for society, ? enthused council member David Grosso (  Large) about the   plan. Oh really?  This much is certain: Architects of progressive ideas in think tanks are celebrating victories scored in their legislative laboratory, the D. C. Council. Of course, having willing lab workers such as Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) Grosso and Elissa Silverman (  Large) facilitates the experiments. District residents aren t the chief beneficiaries, however.  Under the   plan, which the council is expected to adopt next week, most benefits would go to residents outside the city, because the legislation calls for coverage of all workers in the city regardless of where they live.  Who s affected? Of the 531, 999 people who work in the District in the private sector or are   only about 196, 000 live in the city, according to Mayor Muriel E. Bowser s (D) communications director, Kevin Harris. The overwhelming majority  ” 336, 173, or 63 percent  ” live in Maryland or Virginia. Incidentally, those 336, 173 nonresident workers also do not pay the District a cent of tax on income earned in the city because the Home Rule Act bans a commuter tax. So how will the council pay for this generous commuter gift? Money in the government account from which   funds will be drawn must come from somewhere. It will be raised through an increase in payroll taxes imposed on D. C. businesses.   A win for society ?? Grosso, tell that to businesses and consumers.  The same concern about benefits and equity was raised in connection with the   boost.  Again, the winners? They are the 55 percent of the District s   workers who live outside the city. They get the raise, and their wages are protected from D. C. taxation. Oddly enough, Bowser supported the   increase. Facing similar circumstances in the paid   plan, however, Bowser reversed course.   This is about fairness, ? she complained in a statement about increasing the   payroll taxes to fund the plan.  If we are going to raise a quarter of a billion dollars in new taxes each year, then D. C. families should be the primary beneficiaries. ?  I ll try to say this nicely: Consistency in D. C.     remains in short supply. Which gets us back to where this column started: the council s penchant for progressive initiatives pursued at the expense of keeping a close eye on the government Examples? End the tax on tampons (Psst. What about the tax on shoes? ); increase the number of plants a marijuana cultivation center can grow; help the terminally ill kill themselves; force employers to schedule work at least 14 days in advance. As for knowing whether the D. C. government is operating efficiently, effectively and economically, better to ask a rock. Even when legislative oversight is attempted, as in council member Mary M. Cheh s (  3) investigation into allegations of favoritism in city contracting, efforts come off klutzy. Imagine, as in Cheh s case, scheduling a public hearing but closing it to the public. Sad, because the District needs an investigation into contracting practices that favor insiders and campaign contributors. Look no further than the Office of the Chief Financial Officer s destruction of courageous whistleblower Eric W. Payne. It was a dastardly act performed before the very eyes of council member Jack Evans (  2) the finance committee chairman.  But carry on, council  . A decision has not been reached, but a new sheriff  ” the next U. S. attorney  ” may be coming to town. If so, he is going to be recruited by Sen. Jeff Sessions ( .) who may be attorney general when the sheriff s name is sent to the White House. And the sheriff is going to be a Trump nominee. Should this come to pass, the District could be in for a world of hurt.  Ah, but letting folks kill themselves was a really, really big win.

145499,217387,The national teacher shortage is a myth. Here's what's really happening.,Washington Post,Kate Walsh,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161204005809/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-national-teacher-shortage-is-a-myth-heres-whats-really-happening/2016/12/02/58fac7d0-b4e5-11e6-a677-b608fbb3aaf6_story.html
","   Kate Walsh is president of the National Council on Teacher Quality.              Here's something I've been struggling to understand: What makes the prospect of a national teacher shortage such an immediately compelling narrative, capable of spreading with the speed of a brush fire?  With almost no real data  —   because neither states nor the federal government collects the information that would be needed to pronounce the onset of a true teacher shortage  —   we witness the press, school districts, state school boards and even Congress conclude that we are in the throes of a   national crisis. At the root of this crisis is a NY Times news article  published two summers ago reporting on six school districts that were having a tough time filling positions (though all but two ultimately started the year just fine). Whoosh! Overnight the teacher shortage became real. That early spark was then steadily fed by news articles reporting that teacher preparation programs were facing unprecedented enrollment drops. Nobody thought it important to consider that teacher preparation programs had for years been graduating twice as many teachers as are needed. According to findings from the American Institutes for Research, over the past 30 years, programs graduated between 175, 000 and 300, 000 teachers each year, yet consistently school districts have hired only between 60, 000 to 140, 000 newly minted teachers. Instead, school districts have been far more likely to hire people who already have some teaching experience. Federal data from 1999 to 2012 show that only about 30 percent of districts' new hires were straight out of a teacher prep program.  The blaze reached new heights in September with a report from the Learning Policy Institute (LPI) producing a scary chart showing a widening gap between teacher supply and demand over the next five years. But tweaking just one of the assumptions made by LPI leads to results that are altogether different. If we project an average      ratio of 16 to 1 (which it is currently) rather than LPI's estimate of 15. 3 to 1, voilà!: The shortage disappears entirely. What I find so frustrating about all of this is that we do actually have a huge,   problem with teacher supply and demand. For 30 years, most districts in the nation have struggled to find enough certified secondary science and math teachers. And rural and urban districts have been unable to tap into a reliable and stable source of new teachers. One answer to the problem is to pay such teachers more than others, but most districts continue to reject that solution because it is untenable with unions. We also could ramp up the availability of   positions for science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) teachers, but  —   again  —   few schools and states embrace this option because unions worry that districts will seek to replace   employees and their costly benefits with  . I'm inspired by what can happen when districts work smarter. Take Clark County, Nev. which faced a staggering 1, 000 vacancies at the start of the   school year. The next year, district officials began the school year with nearly 700 fewer vacancies. How? They got smart about recruiting and negotiated a higher starting salary for new teachers. They targeted potential applicants from areas with notoriously high costs of living, telling them how they could live better on a teacher's salary in Clark County. State efforts to ease certification requirements and improve certification reciprocity have also helped. This is an approach that is eminently usable elsewhere. We could also employ   solutions. For decades, school districts have been awash with applicants for elementary teaching positions. That's because teacher prep programs don't see it as their job to tell incoming students they can't all major in elementary education  —   that more of them need to consider special education, math or teaching English language learners, where there is real need. Unfortunately, higher ed seems to accept no responsibility for aligning teacher production with district demand. Given that teacher prep programs can't operate without state approval, states could impose limits on production in some areas. The faux teacher shortage is of tremendous consequence. It routinely results in both states and school districts lowering standards for who is licensed and hired. But more important, it serves to distract us from fixing the chronic and persistent misalignment of teacher supply and demand.                "
145500,217388,What backyard birds can tell us about our changing world,Washington Post,David Holahan,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161204005809/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/what-backyard-birds-can-tell-us-about-our-changing-world/2016/12/02/2a2fd1e8-acd4-11e6-977a-1030f822fc35_story.html
","   David Holahan is a writer living in East Haddam, Conn.     I love to watch the birds, but some days I despair. After meandering for an hour about fields, streams and forests, I often see nothing  —   or the equivalent: only juncos, aptly named, or common sparrows. I try to comfort myself with other natural sights and sounds, but my mind won't have it. Where are the avian rock stars? Like those winsome warblers? Whither the preposterous pileated woodpecker (the real Woody Woodpecker)? If a scarlet tanager makes a cameo once a year, one is supposed to be grateful. But I am not. Most birders are not. We want action, color and sweet melodies. Worst of all, sometimes delightful species are about, but they won't stay put for a positive ID, much less a leisurely look. The very instant binoculars focus on them they are gone, higher in the canopy or behind a leafy branch. They must think I'm going to bake them in a pie. Enter the   kinglet, a plump little royal that is blissfully indifferent to the presence of hoi polloi. Kinglets will pose in plain view, sometimes even flitting closer to their stalkers. Birds that are this accommodating almost always are the drab ones, or the usual suspects, your chickadees and titmice. The kinglet, however, boasts a rich palette of orange, yellow, olive, white, black and gray, all artfully combined in a unique design that makes identification a breeze. One once landed in a bush within arm's reach, cocked its colorful crown and stared  —   as if it was adding me to its life list of curiosities. Kinglets are not common here in southeastern Connecticut, and that's a big part of their appeal. Also appealing is their eminent inclusivity; they don't seem to care whom they hang out with, often flocking with other species.  If spying a kinglet or some other scintillating songbird makes for a successful walk, does that mean uneventful sorties are a bust? Now that I am retired, I have more time not only to ramble but also to ponder such riddles. Why is it, for example, that I don't note in my journal when I see bluebirds, but only magnolia warblers, indigo buntings and such glitterati? In fact, bluebirds are quite fetching, but they also are common hereabouts. There's the rub. They used to be less so, and when I saw my first one years ago, I was smitten. Now we're like old married people, barely taking note of each other as we go about our business. In full mating plumage, male bluebirds are a brilliant azure blue about the head and back and brick red on the chest, with a white belly. The females are duller, and juveniles have a mottled look. They will sit on fence posts for minutes at a time, like practiced models. I vow to pay more attention to bluebirds in the future. Bird watching is getting even harder because there are fewer birds every year. Two recent studies documented the decline: one, based on the annual Christmas count, reported that wintering North American birds are down by one third since 1966; the other predicts that unless conservation action is taken more than a third of North American bird species are at risk of extinction. We take the environment for granted, assuming it will take care of itself and will always be there for us. We rarely stop and admire the bluebirds, even if we are out looking for birds. We just experienced two years of extreme electioneering during which global warming barely came up.  One doesn't have to have a position on climate change to appreciate that our species is having a dramatic impact on the environment, as well as on fellow travelers aboard spaceship Earth. It isn't just the iconic animals of Africa that are in trouble. Even if we can summon the will to avert what virtually every scientist warns will be catastrophic warming, we nonetheless are leaving a   place for our children and grandchildren to inhabit, not to mention kinglets. Why would we do that?

145505,217393,"Paul Ryan isn't ruling out Medicare privatization, and it isn't just Democrats who are wary",Washington Post,Mike DeBonis,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161204005809/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/12/02/paul-ryan-isnt-ruling-out-medicare-privatization-but-some-republicans-are-already-wary/
","     House Speaker Paul D. Ryan made clear Thursday that he is willing to pursue a major overhaul of Medicare, including changes that could eventually put private companies in charge of the health care for tens of millions of American seniors. But talk of wholesale changes to the popular federal programs has key Republicans lawmakers nervous about overshooting their electoral mandate. “Save Medicare for another day,” said Sen. Lamar Alexander ( .) chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. “We want to begin immediately to repeal Obamacare. . . . Trying to deal with the solvency issues with Medicare at the same time falls into the category of biting off more than you can chew. It's an important issue, it's one I'm ready to address, but a little humility here would be in order. We can't do everything at once, and we shouldn't try. ” Ryan has long advocated for a major Medicare overhaul, one that would convert the    public health insurance program for seniors and the disabled into a system that would help beneficiaries purchase private insurance. Republicans tend to call such a model “premium support,” saying it is the best way to control Medicare's   costs, while Democrats refer to it as “voucherization” or privatization and argue that it would mean less comprehensive coverage for vulnerable Americans.  On Thursday, Ryan repeated comments he made shortly after the election indicating that changes to Medicare would have to accompany any effort to repeal and replace Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He spoke carefully about how far those efforts might go, but he did not rule out pursuing a premium support model for future retirees  —   a stance Ryan has held for years, dating back to his days chairing the House Budget Committee, and one that was included in his recent “Better Way” policy agenda. “We are going to have to do things to preserve and shore up this program,” he said Thursday. “The reforms that we've been talking about here in the House Republicans for many years are reforms that do not affect the benefits for anyone in or near retirement. But for those of us who are in the younger generations, the X Generation on down, it won't be there for us if we stay on the current path. So we have to do things to fix this program so we can guarantee that it's there intact for current seniors but also that there's something there for us when we retire. ” Those fixes, he said, “are nothing different than what federal employees have: You get to choose among plans that are comprehensive and guaranteed to meet your benefits. Or if you want to stick with the current traditional program, you can do that as well. ” Ryan compared his plan to Medicare Advantage  —   an option for seniors where the federal government pays a private insurer a flat rate for each beneficiary rather than directly paying a health care provider for services rendered  —   calling that a program that “works pretty darn well right now, that seniors like. ” Ryan also repeated a frequent talking point, that “Medicare itself is on a path to going bankrupt” though he did not specifically blame the Affordable Care Act as he has in the past. The Washington Post Fact Checker has concluded it is misleading to say that Medicare would go bankrupt and   incorrect to blame Obamacare, which has extended the solvency of the key Medicare Part A trust fund by nine years.  What also has Medicare's defenders nervous about a push for premium support is   Trump's intention to nominate Rep. Tom Price ( .) as his secretary of health and human services. Price succeeded Ryan as chairman of the House Budget Committee, and, like Ryan, he has embraced premium support as a way to roll back federal entitlement spending over the long term. Also on Thursday, Rep. Kevin Brady ( ) chairman of the   Ways and Means Committee and a Ryan ally, also told the Associated Press that premium support remained on the Republicans agenda, though he said the more immediate priority would be “taking steps, small, in preparing for larger steps to save Medicare for the long term. ” Democrats, eager to seize on an issue important to voters that swung toward Trump this year, have quickly mounted a fierce response to any suggestion that Medicare might be privatized. Sen. Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.) the incoming Senate minority leader, accused Republicans of “plotting a war on seniors” this week after Trump announced his intention to nominate Price to his cabinet. “We say to our Republicans that want to privatize Medicare: Go try it. Make our day,” he said. “We're going to fight tooth and nail any attempt to privatize, voucherize or any   you can think of when it comes to Medicare. To Republicans considering going down this path, my advice is simple, turn back. ” The treacherous politics of entitlement reform is one reason several Senate Republican polled this week said that they were not eager to pursue major Medicare changes  —   at least not right away, as part of an Affordable Care Act repeal.  “My guess is, we'll have our hands full doing what we need to do with Obamacare,” said Sen. Roy Blunt ( .) a member of the Senate Republicans leadership team. “It's fair to say that Obamacare's done a lot of damage to Medicare. And because of that, it will necessarily become part of that discussion. But . . . I think it'd be a mistake to talk about specifics right now. We've got enough to do focused on first steps on Obamacare and we need to stay focused on that until we get that bill passed, and then we need to start looking at how you repair the damage done by Obamacare. ” Ryan on Thursday accused Democrats of trying to “play   politics, which is what they typically do every other Tuesday. ” That prompted Schumer to speak up again: “The people who are genuinely and rightly scared are millions of American seniors who don't believe privatization of Medicare will be in their interest. ” Schumer and other Democrats are set next week to deliver a petition signed by more than a million activists urging Ryan and Republicans to keep their “hands off Medicare. ” Could Republicans, with control of the White House and both houses of Congress, privatize Medicare? They might have to in order to enact a Trump agenda that includes a major tax cut and increased military and infrastructure spending without exploding the national debt. One major hurdle would be in the Senate, where the are likely to be 52 Republican senators and it typically takes 60 senators to pass legislation of any consequence. However, major parts of a Medicare overhaul  —   perhaps the entirety of one  —   could be passed through the budget reconciliation process which reduces the threshold to a simple majority of 50. Compare that to Social Security, the other major driver of   federal budget deficits, which is specifically exempted from reconciliation and thus must garner 60 votes. The other major hurdle is Trump, who on numerous occasions during the campaign said he would not cut Medicare, Social Security or Medicaid, the federal health care program for the poor. Ryan and many congressional Republicans favor significant reforms to all three.  “Every Republican wants to do a big number on Social Security,” Trump said during an April 2015 speech in New Hampshire. “They want to do it on Medicare. They want to do it on Medicaid. And we can't do that. ” “I'll save Medicare,” he said in a Fox News Channel interview the following November. “You don't get rid of Medicare. You can't do that. People love Medicare, and it's unfair to them. But while Trump has never endorsed any specific Medicare reforms beyond eliminating waste, fraud and abuse, the health care agenda posted on his transition website includes this cryptic item: “Modernize Medicare, so that it will be ready for the challenges with the coming retirement of the baby boom generation  —   and beyond. ” Ryan said Thursday he has not discussed Medicare with Trump, but he left the door open to use budget reconciliation to aggressively pursue Republicans policies. “This is our intention  —   to use every tool we've got to make progress for the American people, to make good on the promises that were made,” he said."

There were also works of history, education, psychology and even comedy that made my reading list. Whether they enlightened or annoyed, impressed or exasperated, these are the books that I suspect I will remember most from the past year: The most overrated book I read this year: “Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right” (The New Press) by Arlie Russell Hochschild A finalist for the 2016 National Book Award, this book was the subject of admiring reviews and interviews  —   but I couldn't stand it. The author, a Berkeley sociologist, travels to southwestern Louisiana seeking to understand “how life feels to people on the right,” but she can't let go of her   preconceptions. Hochschild assumes that rural conservatives all read Ayn Rand, for instance, and is surprised that many of them are “warm, open people. ” If you're interested in exploring class resentments in the Trump era, I'd suggest picking up J. D. Vance's “Hillbilly Elegy,” Nancy Isenberg's cultural history “White Trash,” or Carol Anderson's “White Rage” instead. [Read the review]    (Simon & Schuster)  Most enjoyable: “Seinfeldia: How a Show About Nothing Changed Everything” (Simon & Schuster) by Jennifer Keishin Armstrong I'm a   Gen Xer, so “Seinfeld” will forever be my favorite sitcom  —   not that there's anything wrong with that. But it's not just nostalgia that makes me enjoy Armstrong's detailed history of the show and her assessment of its cultural impact. In addition to reliving the biggest laughs along the way, Armstrong shares the experiences of the   “Seinfeld” writers, who desperately mined their personal lives for man hands, fake holidays or any script ideas that would seem believable to   Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David. An eminently   book. [Read the review] Most ambitious: “Stamped From the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America” (Nation Books) by Ibram X. Kendi Sure, “ambitious” is usually code for “long,” and at nearly 600 pages, this book qualifies. But it is also an engrossing and relentless study of how even   individuals can succumb to prejudice and enable racist structures. Spanning the 15th century through today, Kendi shows how racist thinking always crops up after the fact to justify discriminatory actions and how “assimilationists”  —   those who seek to fight disparities but find blame in both the oppressed and the oppressors  —   are complicit. From Frederick Douglass to Obama, no one is unscathed in this deserving winner of the 2016 National Book Award. [Read the review] Most surprising: “Keep the Damned Women Out: The Struggle for Coeducation” (Princeton University Press) by Nancy Weiss Malkiel There are things you take for granted, until you learn how recently they came about or how tortuous their path. That's how I felt while reading Malkiel's history of how several elite U. S. universities  —   in particular, Yale, Princeton, Harvard and Dartmouth  —   finally offered full undergraduate education for women starting in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Still, “coeducation did not mean revolution,” she writes. Women have adapted to these former male bastions more than they have transformed them. [Read the review]    (Simon & Schuster)  Laziest: “Stronger Together: A Blueprint for America's Future” (Simon & Schuster Paperbacks) by Clinton and Tim Kaine The official   campaign book, “Stronger Together” is a   of   speeches and policy statements. The book feels rushed, dutiful and sloppy  —   chunks of text repeat themselves on several occasions  —   and its checklist quality makes it read like an endless State of the Union address. Meant to convey Day One readiness, the book instead offers a mix of incompetence and hubris. I'll never understand why the campaign bothered to put it together. Maybe staffers had nothing better to do two months before Election Day? [Read the review] The best book by one of our presidential candidates: “It Takes a Village” (Simon & Schuster) by Clinton Although it was panned when it came out nearly 21 years ago, “It Takes a Village” has aged well and offers more insight into Clinton than either of her two subsequent memoirs, “Living History” and “Hard Choices. ” Written after the defeat of her   initiative, “It Takes a Village” lays out Clinton's political vision  —   a surprising blend of moderation, social conservatism and activist ambition that foreshadowed her struggles to fend off the Bernie Sanders insurgency on her left in this latest presidential bid. [Read the review]    (University of Pennsylvania)  Most enlightening: “What Is Populism?” (University of Pennsylvania Press) by   Müller This slim, incisive book helped me grasp the rise of Trump in American politics better than anything else. By building a framework for understanding populist movements  —   they are not just   but also   and politically exclusionary  —   Müller elucidates the strategy and appeal of the Trump phenomenon, and the divisions it has revealed and created. The “core claim” of populism, he writes, is that “only some of the people are really the people. ” And by outlining the typical governing strategies of populist regimes, it offers a possible preview of a Trump administration in action. [Read the review] Saddest: “A Mother's Reckoning: Living in the Aftermath of Tragedy” (Crown Publishers) by Sue Klebold Seventeen years after the massacre at Columbine High School, the mother of one of the killers tells her story, and it makes for brutal, painful and necessary reading. Sue Klebold scours her younger son's childhood for warning signs, both questions and defends her own parenting, and regrets not listening more closely to what Dylan tried to tell her. “I wish I had acknowledged his feelings instead of trying to talk him out of them,” she writes. Reading this book as a critic is hard; reading it as a parent is devastating. [Read the review] Most hopeful: “The Fractured Republic: Renewing America's Social Contract in the Age of Individualism” (Basic Books) by Yuval Levin A leading thinker in the “reform conservative” movement, Levin has authored a new vision for the American right, one less concerned with tearing down Washington or promoting   than with creating space for the “mediating institutions” of family and community to thrive. It is a vision that seems to have little chance in Trump's Republicans, yet it is precisely for this reason that I find it a hopeful work. In an era of painful divisions, Levin wants us to bowl together again. [Read the review]    (Metropolitan Books)  Most prescient: “Listen, Liberal: Or, What Ever Happened to the Party of the People?” (Metropolitan Books) by Thomas Frank For those still pondering how Clinton lost, Frank's book, published eight months before the election, is an excellent start. In recent decades, he argues, the Democrats has abandoned the working class and instead embraced the professional class of doctors, lawyers, engineers, entrepreneurs, financiers, artists and other   creatives. He blames Bill and Clinton, who fell in love with Wall Street, and Obama, who fell in love with Silicon Valley  —   all at the expense of traditional liberal causes. “They didn't believe in those things,” Frank writes, a simple and damning assessment. [Read the review] Most useful: “The Confidence Game: Why We Fall for It . . . Every Time” (Viking) by Maria Konnikova A contributing writer for the NYer, Konnikova breaks down the psychology of schemes and scams across the centuries in “The Confidence Game,” a disturbing manual on how to avoid getting conned. Each chapter explains one step in the fraud: the   the play, the rope, the tale, the convincer, the breakdown, the touch and, finally, the  . “Despite our deep certainty in our own immunity,” Konnikova writes, “we all fall for it. ” Whether you're dealing with a card cheat, a fake nonprofit or a crooked vendor, it's the kind of book that makes you wonder about everyone  —   and trust no one. [Read the review]    (NY Review Books)  Most ominous: “The Shipwrecked Mind: On Political Reaction” (NY Review Books) by Mark Lilla The book is a sequel of sorts to “The Reckless Mind,” Lilla's 2001 study of leading intellectuals who grew to fetishize authoritarian politics. In this new volume, Lilla, a professor of humanities at Columbia University, examines the gathering forces of reaction among the American right, longing for the uniformity of the early postwar years; European nationalists, blaming Enlightenment values for the continent's ills; and political Islamists, animated by visions of a caliphate restored. Their reactionary nostalgia is more powerful than liberal hope. “Hopes can be disappointed,” Lilla writes. “Nostalgia is irrefutable. ” [Read the review] Most irritating: “Why We Write About Ourselves: Twenty Memoirists on Why They Expose Themselves (and Others) in the Name of Literature” (Plume) by Meredith Maran (editor) I love memoirs, but after reading this book, I can't say I'm terribly fond of memoir writers. A collection of reflections from some 20 practitioners of the genre, this book wallows in the   involved in telling all. Is memoir therapeutic? Should you care about hurting those closest to you? And is it okay to mix in some fictional elements to fill in the holes and enhance the drama? There are helpful insights here for the aspiring oversharer, but for this reader, there is something extra   about baring your soul about how good you are at baring your soul. [Read the review] Smartest: “We Gon' Be Alright: Notes on Race and Resegregation” (Picador) by Jeff Chang I almost categorized this work as the smartest book I read “on race” this year  —   but then I realized it was the smartest, period. Stanford University's Chang skillfully combines reporting, reflection and insight to explain the commercialization of diversity, the contradictions of the Asian American experience and, above all, the reversing of desegregation efforts in education and housing. “From Wallace and Nixon to Palin and Trump,” Chang writes, “the energies of anxious whites have been diverted from class uprising toward racial division. ” [Read the review]    (Brookings Institution Press)  The book I'd most want   Trump to read: “Why Presidents Fail: And How They Can Succeed Again” (Brookings Institution Press) by Elaine C. Kamarck Trump is not prone to reading much, but if he has time to pick up a book during this presidential transition, he could do worse than to delve into Kamarck's warnings of a “crisis of competence” in American government. Modern presidents are obsessed with the communications and theatrical aspects of the job, she writes, and they tend to neglect the crucial task of getting to know the massive federal bureaucracy they command  —   both its limits and its possibilities. Trump seems especially susceptible to this problem. As a result, presidents' ability to manage crises and implement policy suffers greatly. [Read the review] And the best book I read this year: “Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City” (Crown) by Matthew Desmond In this astonishing feat of ethnography, Desmond immerses himself in the lives of Milwaukee families caught in the cycle of chronic eviction. In spare and penetrating prose, this Harvard sociologist chronicles the economic and psychological toll of living in substandard housing, and the eviscerating impact of constantly moving between homes and shelters. With “Evicted,” Desmond has made it impossible to consider poverty without grappling with the role of housing. [Read the review] This pick was not close.

145520,217415,Robots won't kill the workforce. They'll save the global economy.,Washington Post,Ruchir Sharma,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161205004132/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/02/robots-wont-kill-the-workforce-theyll-save-the-global-economy/
","     The United Nations forecasts that the global population will rise from 7. 3 billion to nearly 10 billion by 2050, a big number that often prompts warnings about overpopulation. Some have come from   who fear that population growth will outstrip the food supply, leaving a hungry planet. Others appear in the tirades of   populists, invoking the specter of a rising tide of humanity as cause to slam borders shut. Still others inspire a chorus of   who fear that the “rise of the robots” is rapidly making human workers obsolete, a threat all the more alarming if the human population is exploding. Before long, though, we're more likely to treasure robots than to revile them. They may be the one thing that can protect the global economy from the dangers that lie ahead. An increase of 2. 5 billion people may sound catastrophic. But what matters for economic growth is not the number of people but the rate of population growth. Since its peak in the 1960s, that rate has slumped by almost half to just 1 percent, and the U. N. forecast assumes that this slowdown will continue. Women are having fewer children, so fewer people are entering the working ages between 15 and 64, and   growth is poised to decline from Chile to China. At the same time, owing to rapid advances in health care and medicine, people are living longer  and most of the coming global population increase will be among the retirement crowd. These trends are toxic for economic growth, and boosting the number of robots may be the easiest answer for many countries. One simple way to estimate how fast an economy can grow is by adding   population growth and productivity growth: If the number of workers and output per worker are both increasing by 1 percent a year, then economic output should rise by roughly 2 percent. Over the past decade, both sides of that equation have declined dramatically across the world. In the USA, productivity growth has fallen by almost half from its postwar average, but growth in the labor force has slid even faster, dropping by   to an average pace of 0. 5 percent, according to calculations performed for my book. Though many explanations have been offered for the slow recovery from the global financial crisis of 2008, the clearest answer may be aging populations. Something will have to fill the void left by, say, retiring farmers, and particularly at a time of rising hostility to immigrants, it is likely to be farmbots. It may not be long before economists are worrying about a global shortage of robots. In many industrial countries, from Germany to Japan to South Korea, growth in the   population has already peaked, acting as a drag on the economy. Widely overlooked, however, is the fact that the   slowdown is unfolding even faster in the emerging world, according to my research. Consider the turning point that China hit last year. For the first time since records began in the 1950s, its   population growth was negative. As a result, China's labor force is expected to lose 1 million workers each year for the foreseeable future, and it is also aging rapidly. Studies by Evercore ISI, a research firm, show that the elderly share of the population is rising more than twice as fast as it did in the USA and more than four times faster than in France at similar stages of development. Asked by an alarmed dinner companion about the threat robots posed to jobs in China, Nobel economist Daniel Kahneman responded: “You just don't get it. In China, the robots are going to come just in time. ” No wonder Beijing now offers heavy subsidies to companies involved in industrial automation. And timing is critical. Those who fear the   impact of machines say this generation of technology is different because it is coming so fast. If older generations created tools for use by humans, such as sewing machines, the new forms of automation are imbued with artificial intelligence, capable of “machine learning” and of rapidly replacing humans in a broad swath of jobs, from manufacturing to services  —   even jobs that involve writing about robots. Concern about this disruptive advance has been stirred up by authorities such as Oxford University researchers Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne, who predicted in 2013 that nearly half of U. S. jobs would be at risk from automation in the next decade or two. These alarms have sounded before, however. The Machine Intelligence Research Institute at the University of California at Berkeley has found that today, the average forecast for when artificial intelligence will arrive is about 20 years. But that was also the standard prediction in 1955. And often, humans find a way of working with their automated creations. After the introduction of supermarket scanners, the number of cashiers grew. Though   software appeared to threaten the jobs of paralegals, their ranks increased, too. Now, many fear that   trucks will displace millions of American truckers, but they may create more and better jobs for those who service those increasingly complex vehicles. If automation was displacing human workers as fast as implied in recent books like Martin Ford's “The Rise of the Robots,” then we should be seeing a negative impact on jobs already. We're not. Since 2008, economic growth has been weak compared with that in other   recoveries, but job growth in the major industrial countries has been relatively strong. In the Group of Seven, the world's top industrial countries, unemployment has fallen faster than expected in the face of weak economic growth, and faster than in any comparable period since at least the 1970s. The Japanese economy is growing at 0. 8 percent, yet it is at full employment. According to my research, the job picture has been particularly strong in Germany, Japan and South Korea  —   the industrial countries that employ the most robots . True, robots do represent a new obstacle for some poorer nations, namely those few that do not suffer from population decline. In the postwar era, countries like China escaped poverty by moving a rising young population off the farm and into more productive jobs in factories. Indeed, it was unusual for any country to sustain rapid growth unless the   population was increasing faster than 2 percent a year. My analysis shows that, in the 1980s, 17 of the 20 largest emerging economies had a   population expanding that fast, according to my research, but now there are only two: Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. And they will have a hard time moving a large segment of their young populations into industrial jobs, given that they now have to compete with robotic manufacturing elsewhere. Yet for the rising number of countries facing population decline, the effort to lift the labor force has begun. Starting in the 1980s, led by Singapore, nations from Chile to Australia have offered baby bonuses for women to have more children, but many have found that these bonuses are ineffective in the face of stronger cultural forces, including the desire of many women to pursue a career before having children. Others have tried with some success to boost the workforce directly by raising the retirement age, offering women incentives to join or return to the labor force after having kids, and opening doors to immigrant workers. The simple math, however, shows that particularly in rapidly aging, conservative societies such as Japan and Germany, none of these groups has the potential to make up for coming declines in the   population. Germany decided to admit roughly 1 million refugees in 2015, in part for economic reasons, but the resulting controversy has reduced the flow. Germany would have to admit 1. 5 million each year through 2030 to fully offset the economic impact of its aging population. Japan, which on average admits fewer than 70, 000 immigrants per year, would have to admit 1 million annually. Given the widespread political backlash against immigration, increases this large are unlikely. So far, robots are drawing comparatively little populist fire, perhaps in part because their numbers are still quite low. Worldwide, the industrial labor force includes about 320 million humans, compared with just 1. 6 million robots. That's a huge gap, even counting the superior strength and speed of the robots. And most of them fall in the category of unintelligent machines, committed to a single task such as turning a bolt or painting a car door. Nearly half of them work in the auto industry, which is still the largest employer (of humans) in the USA. In the future, economists may start counting robots the way they now count gains in the   population, as a driver of growth. For much of the world, robots will stand alongside immigrants, women and the elderly as a fourth pool of labor. Whether by design or accident, many of the countries with the most rapidly aging populations already have the most robots. According to the International Federation of Robotics, the nations with the highest density of industrial robots include South Korea, with 531 per 10, 000 employees, Japan with 305 and Germany with 301. The USA ranks eighth with 176. China is well behind with only 49, but on the bright side  —   arguably  —   it had the world's   robot population. Today, population trends are the most powerful force shaping the rise and fall of nations, the starting point of any discussion about an economy's prospects. Most of the world is graying fast, and the economic answer to aging will be all hands on deck, no matter what they're made of."
145522,217417,Five myths about the decline and fall of Rome,Washington Post,Nathan Pilkington,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161205004132/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-the-decline-and-fall-of-rome/2016/12/02/1c06ee5a-b682-11e6-a677-b608fbb3aaf6_story.html
","   Nathan Pilkington is a lecturer in the department of history at Columbia University.    The rise of Trump supposedly heralds the decline of the American idea, according to many of his critics, who've taken the opportunity to compare this moment to the fall of Rome's republic in 31 B. C. or its empire in the 5th century A. D. Any historian is happy when their period of study comes into vogue, but these requiems leave a false impression of Roman antiquity and the causes of its greatest crises.  Myth No. 1 America is going throughwhat republican Rome did. These comparisons are common. Former Supreme Court justice David Souter has said that embracing an   figure who promises to solve the nation's problems is “how the Roman republic fell. ” Augustus, Rome's first emperor, ended democracy “because he promised that he would solve problems that were not being solved,” Souter said in the 2012 quote, which resurfaced during this fall's campaign. Along those same lines, a Huffington Post headline claimed: “Rome Had Caesar. America Has Trump. The People Were and Are Desperate. ”  But such comparisons are light on scholarship. Simply put, most experts believe there is little to compare. Yes, the USA has seen a rise in populism, but it hasn't experienced a microgram of the violence that accompanied the fall of the Roman republic. The end came only after numerous civil wars over offices and honor  decades of gang violence in the capital, and waves of sanctioned political murder. By that measure, Trump is no Caesar. Myth No. 2 The republic collapsed because of class conﬂict. In a recent article in the Week,   Gobry claimed that “what historians now refer to as the crisis of the Roman Republic had a deeper,   component. ” And as in Rome, he wrote, in   America “there is definitely a patrician class and a plebeian class” that are “at loggerheads. ” In the Daily Beast, Michael Tomasky also found an analogue for America's turbulence under Trump in Rome's past: “The patricians and the plebeians had clashed for decades,” he wrote. “It was a class struggle pure and simple. ”  But the struggle between patricians and plebeians took place more than 250 years before the republic's collapse. During an early republican period known to historians as the Conflict of the Orders  between 494 and 287 B. C. plebeians won the right to have their own magistrates  —   the tribunes  —   and to hold their own assembly to make laws for the entire Roman state. Patricians were excluded from this assembly but bound by its laws. Plebeians also gained election to the consulship, the highest office in Rome. After 366 B. C. normally one of the two consuls was a plebian.  Patricians and plebeians were not “classes” in the modern sense of the term. According to Roman myth, the patricians were descended from the original senators appointed by Rome's founder, Romulus, to assist him in  . Patrician status was inherited, and plebians made up the rest of society. After the Conflict of the Orders, many plebeians became wealthy and powerful, while certain patrician families saw their fortunes decline and disappeared from history. Pompey the Great, for all his riches and power, was a plebeian from an area colonized in the 3rd century B. C. Emperor Augustus was born a plebeian; it was only when he was adopted by Julius Caesar in his will that he became a patrician.  Myth No. 3 The empire collapsed because of widespread lead poisoning. Professor Jerome Nriagu offered this theory in 1983  and its popularity is rising again because of recent investigations of lead contamination in Rome's harbor. A 2014 article in Science wondered, “Did Lead Poisoning Bring Down Ancient Rome? ,” concluding that it quite possibly played a role; astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson suggested in an episode of “Cosmos” that lead had a hand in the decline of the empire. Supposedly lead shrunk the population by poisoning the water, leaving the empire weakened and vulnerable. It's just not true. The argument is predicated on the belief that most Romans used lead pipes to deliver water, lead cauldrons to boil wine, lead as a sweetener and lead in makeup. But the majority of Romans were rural farmers who lived at or barely above subsistence levels; they drank from local or personal wells and lacked the means to regularly indulge in makeup and sweetened wine. Even if the city of Rome did have fairly high levels of lead in its public water system, which some recent skeletal evidence may support, it represented only   of the population of the empire. Lead contamination was never widespread enough to cause fertility problems, mass poisoning or other debilitating illnesses on a sufficient scale to diminish the Roman population and leave it powerless against invading armies.  Myth No. 4 The empire collapsed because of barbarian invasions. In a recent Huffington Post article, political scientist Joseph Nye compared the decay of America to the fall of the Roman Empire, fretting that “an absolute decline in [Rome's] society, economy and institutions . . . left it unable to protect itself from hordes of invading barbarian tribes. ” Likewise, a Utah State University guide to Rome claims that “barbarian forces overran western Europe, spelling the end of an era. ”  Yet Rome didn't succumb to a sudden influx of barbarians at the gate. Nor were Goths or other Germanic peoples “barbarian” in the modern sense of the term. They had regularly interacted with the Roman Empire for 200 years and, in many cases, were educated, trained and employed inside its perimeters before they succeeded in destroying imperial authority in Italy, France, the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa during the 5th century A. D. At various times over these two centuries, the tribes served in Roman armies.  Alaric, who famously led the Visigothic migration through the empire to the gates of Rome (  A. D.) started his military career commanding Gothic troops serving in the Roman army. His primary opponent was Stilicho, a     who commanded the armies of the western half of the empire. The eventual rout was no invasion of unknown “hordes,” as Nye put it.  Myth No. 5 The empire collapsed because of Christianity. In his monumental study “The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,” Edward Gibbon famously proposed that Christianity sparked a decrease in civic duty and a corresponding unwillingness to sacrifice for the empire in its period of greatest stress, ultimately leading (along with barbarian invasions) to its collapse. Because of the widespread acclamation accorded to it, both at the time and by later generations, Gibbon's work has had unusual longevity. But no modern scholar believes Gibbon's thesis, if only for the simple fact that a Christian Roman Empire in the east survived the Germanic migration and lived on as the Byzantine Empire for nearly another millennium. Gibbon was also aware of the fact that the Goths were Christian, but he chose to ignore this when assailing the Roman Empire for its adherence to a new faith. All parties at the end of the Roman Empire were Christian.  Thanks to Peter Brown's magnificent work “The World of Late Antiquity,” most scholars now consider the collapse of the Western Roman Empire to be part of a larger process of transformation, not a decline and fall. Rome had become peripheral to the empire it created, whose center of political and economic life shifted to Constantinople, modern Istanbul, over the course of the 4th century A.
