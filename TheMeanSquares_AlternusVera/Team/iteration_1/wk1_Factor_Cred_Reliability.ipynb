I used their dataset and whichever was toxic, I would label as biased, otherwise un-biased. There is definitely improvement to be made here but for the time being this is what I went with this because the more toxic someone is, the more likely they are to be biased. I was able to use the countvectorizer to help my model identify posts/comments that seemed biased/un-biased. I didn’t get a chance but I wanted to see if I could get the sentiment analysis on the headline and content to see if they were different. If they were, this would tell me that it is a click bait like article (headline is saying one thing, content is saying something else). This would also help indicate if it is biased/un-biased. I could then add this with the countvectorizer and naivebayes classier to get better results. \n","\n","For the time, I got 85% accuracy by using just countvectorizer from the toxic dataset and naivebayes.
